<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an unexpected pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill. Mr Speaker, as you know, this is a very important matter and I take cognisance of the personal explanation you made last night and the context of the comments you made on behalf of the government at the time of the original legislation. I had the pleasure of being on the committee that you chaired, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, when it inquired into sports funding and administration. I was a party to the inquiry entitled `Can Sport be Bought?' That puts me in a difficult situation on this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the legislation. I am disappointed that the opposition, while supporting the legislation, has continually taken the opportunity that this debate gives to chastise the government, saying that this is yet another piece of legislation that has been brought in simply to repair problems that have arisen. In the opposition's eyes, the original legislation was put in in haste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the government has anything to be ashamed of. In regard to the operation of legislation, the government comes into this place to make the necessary improvements to ensure that legislation we have enacted is achieving its aims. I listened with interest to a number of the contributions last night. Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to review all the contributions, but I found myself in agreement with many of the points that were made by speakers on both sides. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) for ensuring that I have an audience. The issue of tobacco advertising is important. As honourable members mentioned in the debate last night, throughout this parliament we have put in place&mdash;as in an overwhelming number of public buildings&mdash;a ban on smoking. I am a little disappointed that some of my colleagues have not necessarily heeded that ban. I do not want to be described as having a Stalinist attitude to this issue, but if it is good enough for other people who work in this building to do the right thing, under the directive of the Speaker and the President, then honourable members should see their way clear and not put themselves above that sort of ban. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in a number of the comments the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) made last night. I was a little shocked and worried that I found myself in agreement with some of the things he said. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a worry. He has had his left wing clipped, and it is a real worry. The observation he made about the quality of air in this place compared with the quality of air outside was an observation I made in the last week of sitting. I was shocked, having decided to do the right thing and get out of the airconditioned building, when walking across a number of the courtyards, to find the air outside, especially immediately outside some of the doors of this building, was of an inferior quality to the processed airconditioned air inside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I could be so bold as to suggest that we need to look at some way of providing better facilities than alongside the doorways of this building for those who wish to go outside to smoke. I have got no problem with people coming to their decision to partake in tobacco, but one of the real problems of tobacco smoking is the secondary effects of that smoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might be interested to know it is a discussion that I have often had with my predecessor. It makes it a bit difficult because I am a bit one-out in my family. Both my parents were smokers, although, fortunately, my mother is no longer a smoker. My brothers are smokers, and in family gatherings I ain't got the numbers, but I try valiantly to fight the fight. One of the arguments that is always put to me is that if I were not to partake in alcohol perhaps they would stop smoking. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for the Northern Territory reminds me, another ex-member besides my predecessor whom I have a great deal of admiration for is the former member for Melbourne. He had a similar view. At some stage down the track, measures&mdash;perhaps not to the same extent as the measures we have for tobacco&mdash;for alcohol might be required to be put in place, but it is something that we need to look at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the things that people get excited about with tobacco advertising is its relationship with sport. Fortunately, we see that being phased out. As you know, Mr Speaker, that was one of the central issues that we looked at on the finance and public administration committee. Whilst your associations are different from mine, the importance of association with sport were acknowledged in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the AFL club that I have some connection with&mdash;not directly in its administration but certainly an emotional attachment&mdash;is the Fitzroy football club. It has been sponsored for a number of years by the Quit campaign. That has been a very important and successful association in the public relations and education role. The club has not been as successful on field as it should have been, but that is beside the point. Having clubs such as Fitzroy and others sponsored by the Quit campaign is an important association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Soccer Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Soccer Federation, which is an important sporting group, came before the inquiry. It had consciously made the decision to have that association, because it saw that as important. Soccer is a sport that is proud of its junior development, and the federation saw it as an appropriate program to be associated with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, the national basketball team that I have some emotional attachment to, the North Melbourne Giants, has had a long association with various health campaigns. In fact, its association has been on the side of appropriate use of alcohol. For some years, the sponsorship was with the `Booze less' campaign and now they are associated with the `Rage without alcohol' campaign. It is important to note that those in the health foundation that provide the money see that it is valuable to be associated with sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are attempting to not only put forward and challenge some of the views of adults in our community but also ensure that younger people in our society are exposed to a range of values that can be important down the track and in later life. It is intriguing to have a look at the purpose of tobacco advertising. Whilst we have the argument from the tobacco companies that promotion of their separate products is either to protect their market share or to readjust their market share, I would contend that promotion of tobacco in any way must continue to influence especially younger people considering taking up the habit of tobacco smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a difficulty. That may not be the intention of the companies but there is evidence that it is a consequence of their activities. That is why the legislation we have before us in amending the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 is important. It is an important way of sending signals to our younger generations that there is a downside to adopting a habit that they might associate with some sort of glamorous lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) set out in his second reading speech, looking at the Australian situation, nearly 19,000 deaths in the year that the original legislation was passed were directly associated with tobacco consumption. As he stated, tobacco consumption costs our country approximately $9.24 billion each year in health, social and economic costs. Interestingly, last night the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) developed that argument in putting a case to double the amount of excise because he recognised that there was an economic downside to people's continued consumption of tobacco products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report of the US Surgeon-General <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Preventing tobacco </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">use among young people</EMPHASIS>, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, in her introduction to the report, quoted the statistic for America when she said, `Smoking kills 434,000 Americans each year.' Taking that American figure and considering activities in other countries around the world, we have a problem of huge dimensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always some direct, but mostly anecdotal, evidence of the way some tobacco companies behave because of contracting markets in more developed countries and their marketing activities in Third World countries. A number of those Third World countries have enormous health problems as it is and they could well do without the pressures of tobacco consumption. So it is important that we view Australia's action in an international dimension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has taken a number of measures at national, state and territory levels which have been seen by overseas countries as important examples of what can be achieved. For example, actions by the Victorian and Western Australian governments highlight active involvement in a wide range of health programs, including those such as the Quit campaign, that try to give people the necessary tools to kick the habit. A number of people I know who smoke acknowledge that they are not doing the right thing by themselves but, because of the addictive nature of the habit, it is very difficult for them to kick the habit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already exposed the attitude of the previous honourable member for Scullin about smoking, in fairness to him I should say one of the contradictions that were brought to my attention on a number of occasions was that in his career as a medical practitioner, one of the first things he quite often did when advising people was to tell them to stop smoking. When I was down the street or around a polling booth, which is when it seemed to happen a lot, people would come up to me and talk about having visited Dr Harry. They said that one of the things that intrigued them was that whilst they felt so much better now that they had been able to kick the habit&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To finish that anecdote, the contradiction of course is that the former honourable member for Scullin continues to smoke. I might add that at his time of life, all things being equal, it is probably not a real problem to him any more in that any damage has been done. The fact that the habit enables him to be comfortable is a consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important piece of legislation. It is an important activity of government to ensure that problems like tobacco consumption and its effect on the health of the nation are addressed. As the figures set out in the second reading speech show, this is a major problem that needs to be addressed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill which seeks to restrict the right of companies to advertise a product which they can legally sell. I think it is ironic that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is associated with this legislation. She is seen by many as a person that many young people would look up to in Western Australia, in fact all over Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Johns" NAMEID="JH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr Johns</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6V5">Mr CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure they do. It is ironic, therefore, that the minister was shown in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> newspaper in Perth not so long ago indulging in the unhealthy habit of smoking. In the paper was a photo of `Puffing Carmen' with a smoke hanging out of her mouth. What a great advertisement for the tobacco companies to have had the then Premier puffing away on the front of a widely read family newspaper! She is looked up to by many people. I believe the minister has now given up the filthy habit, for which I congratulate her. Nevertheless I hope the fact that she was seen puffing away did not encourage others to smoke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had a photograph on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of a gentleman who is not flavour of the month with the Australian Labor Party at the moment&mdash;Kerry Packer&mdash;on his way to rugby league headquarters, puffing on a cigarette. One would have thought with his recent health problems that that was not the way to go. If he keeps that up perhaps he will not be a threat to the media of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years after the minister for health was seen promoting a habit she was addicted to, she legislates to prohibit its promotion. I speak as a father and grandfather and as one who does not smoke. I have two daughters who used to smoke but, thankfully, they do not any more. One of my daughters is a nurse and she knows of a person who has had all four limbs amputated as a direct result of smoking. Yet, with the stumps of her arms, this woman was still able to put a cigarette in her mouth and smoke. This highlights the harmful effects of smoking, the obvious difficulty with forcing people to quit and the definite need to prevent people from taking up the habit. Once people are addicted, it is terribly difficult to break that addiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that smoking is a death warrant. A cigarette is a lethal, slow killing drug. It is important for us to reduce smoking amongst all Australians. A report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Health 1994</EMPHASIS>, stated that a most alarming trend is the rapid rise in female lung cancer since the 1960s. The age-standardised death rate rose 5.7 per 100,000 in 1966 to 17.5 per 100,000 in 1992 as a result of women's increased cigarette consumption since the 1940s. There have been declines in lung cancer death rates in men but they remain three times those of women. The proportion of men smoking declined through the 1980s and into the 1990s, and it is expected this will reduce men's lung cancer death rates over the next decade. Smoking rates in women have also declined, but at a slower rate, which may curb the increase in women's lung cancer death rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about the dangers of smoking. Worse is the frightening statistics about the number of potential cancer victims: that is, young people who smoke and are therefore at a greater risk of getting cancer. The Centre of Behavioural Research into Cancer recently reported an alarming increase in smoking among 13- to 17-year-olds. There are now 260,000 secondary school children smoking about 330 million cigarettes, which is costing them $49 million. The Minister for Human Services and Health made us aware of these awful statistics during question time on Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teenage smoking, after initially falling, is again on the rise. The question is: why do people smoke and what starts them smoking? Is it advertising? Is it peer pressure? Is it the taste&mdash;though I doubt it&mdash;or is it part of all of those and other factors? If it is not advertising, this bill and the act it amends will be useless because, three to five years down the track, young people will still be smoking. Men and women will still be dying from smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that anti-smoking campaigns and promotions do work and should be continued. In fact, I believe they could be a bit more forthright, like many of our drink-driving advertisements. They could go along the lines of, `If you smoke, you're a bloody idiot and you're going to die.' You have to spell it out that bluntly. It is an effective advertisement to stop drink-driving and it would be an even better anti-smoking advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether this bill or the act it amends will be effective. How many kids are influenced to smoke by looking at a sign at the cricket mentioning a brand name of some cigarettes? How many people are actually encouraged to smoke because they have seen a glossy advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women's Weekly</EMPHASIS> of a young man and woman on the beach with a cigarette in their hands? Frankly, I do not think cigarette advertising encourages smoking to the extent that perhaps some people think. I am prepared to support this bill if the government thinks it will discourage smoking, and I will support most measures to discourage the habit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, let me also stress my concern about the inhibition of freedom of speech. I am a great believer and supporter of freedom of speech. While I have no trouble supporting this bill, I still feel a touch hypocritical supporting a bill which prohibits the right of a business to sell a legally available product. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) last year was condemned for making similar comments. She was condemned by the minister for health, the AMA and the Doctors Reform Society. The latter group would perhaps be better known as the Association of Labor Doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had some sympathy for the member for Mackellar. The minister for health was sprouting the dangers of smoking, saying that we need to prevent smoking, that cigarettes are deadly drugs which cost the whole community and so on. Well, if she is so concerned about it, why is she not campaigning for tobacco to be an illegal product? Why ban the ads? It is the smokes that kill, not the commercials. It comes back to what the former member for Wentworth, John Hewson, talked about on Monday: honesty and politics. If we are all honest with ourselves, smoking would be illegal. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6V5">Mr CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe she has kicked the habit. But, being politicians, we need the money from taxes on smokes and we are afraid we will lose votes if we prohibit the sale of tobacco. As well, we will simply create a big black market for the sale of cigarettes like there is for the more illicit drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the point I am trying to make is that, if we are to make a significant inroad into preventing smoking, it is not the prevention of advertising of tobacco that will achieve it&mdash;though it may make a small contribution. If the minister for health was honest about the facts, it is smoking that should be prohibited, not the advertising of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By prohibiting smoking advertising, are we reducing the number of people who smoke? Do not get me wrong, I do not like smoking. If prohibiting tobacco advertising saves lives then, notwithstanding my support for freedom of speech, I will support the bill. But, at the end of the day, will the measure be effective? Will it greatly reduce smoking?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey of Victorian school students in 1992 found that the most prevalent drugs used by students were licit drugs&mdash;pain relievers, alcohol and tobacco&mdash;which were also perceived by students as the least dangerous drugs. It is unfortunate that people so young are taking up the habit, in the belief that smoking is not dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey also revealed that, by year 11, 78 per cent of students had tried smoking and 24 per cent were regular daily smokers. In year 9, females smoked proportionally more than males. However, by year 11, the gender difference had disappeared. These statistics are certainly a worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore important for the government to do its utmost to discourage smoking by all people, in particular to prevent young people taking up the habit. Such preventative campaigns are much more effective than prohibiting companies advertising a legal product. Many advertisements in Western Australia have been aimed at discouraging smoking. I believe the falling number of smokers is a result of them, and I am more comfortable supporting these campaigns first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making a number of points to prevent my being misrepresented. I fully and unequivocally support free speech. I do not like smoking and will support most measures to reduce smoking and therefore save lives. I one day hope that the vast majority of, if not all, Australians choose not to smoke without the need for prohibition. Having enunciated my reservations with it, I nevertheless do not oppose this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill, which amends the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco smoking is now widely acknowledged as the major cause of preventable death and disease in Australia. A staggering 19,000 Australians each year die from smoking related illnesses. Tobacco consumption costs Australia the enormous amount of over $9 billion a year in health, social and economic costs. It also causes cardiovascular disease, which is Australia's biggest health problem, and is the largest cause of death from cancer in Australian males. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national health policy on tobacco has the support of all state and territory governments as well as the national government. All governments have a responsibility to take a strong stand towards reducing tobacco consumption, which is why limiting tobacco advertising is so important as we try to discourage young people from smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with interest that many of the speakers in this debate have related their own personal history of whether they have smoked and how they feel about smoking. I have always considered myself very fortunate in this respect because I have never been a smoker. I have never had any desire to be a smoker. Neither of my parents smoked. I recall that in my very early years my parents influenced me on what a dirty, filthy habit it is. I certainly believe today that it is a dirty, filthy, disgusting habit but, unfortunately, one which some people&mdash;including friends of mine&mdash;are addicted to. I feel sorry for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My father smoked for a brief period during the Second World War when he was in the air force but he quickly gave it up after the war. My mother never smoked and, unlike a lot of other children my age at the time, I never had any desire to smoke. In fact, I have always had a very negative view of smoking. In 1960 I was in grade 3 and eight years old. I remember we were shown a film at school which, for the times, was fairly graphic. It showed the lungs of a smoker compared with the lungs of a non-smoker. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, when I was eight years old, I saw a very graphic film about the evils of smoking, which certainly had a lasting impression on me. It is not as though I needed to see the film because, as I have already explained, I never had any desire to be a smoker. I guess there was a time when, like most teenagers, I was a bit curious about smoking. When I was out with friends, I had a few puffs on a cigarette but, whenever I inhaled, I doubled over and nearly choked. Two or three times after that I tried it again, and the same thing happened. That certainly reinforced my view that smoking was not for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of my total aversion to smoking and my incapability to smoke, I have never had any desire to smoke marijuana. A lot of honourable members have probably tried that from time to time, and I do not pass judgment on them. I have certainly never tried marijuana, for the same reason that I do not smoke cigarettes: inhaling smoke is something that I find repulsive. All that was back in the 1960s, when I was a teenager. In those days there was not as much public awareness about smoking and the damage that it could cause. There were some reports saying that smoking could cause lung cancer, and we all know that is true. As was revealed the other day in the House, the Menzies cabinet had the opportunity to place restrictions or a ban on tobacco advertising smoking but its members did not think it was necessary. They were more concerned about the profits of the tobacco industry than that of public health in Australia. Like much of what happened during the Menzies years, that is to be regretted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> During the 1970s and certainly the 1980s the term `passive smoking' was introduced into the debate. I think the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) talked about passive smoking. As smoking is not allowed inside this building, a lot of people can be found smoking outside, where the air is more polluted than it is inside. That is a bit of a worry. Basically, even if you are a non-smoker, you still inhale smoke as a result of other people's smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1980s there was quite a bit of legal discussion about passive smoking. I recall that one or two workers claimed compensation in the courts for becoming ill as a result of passive smoking. An Attorney-General's opinion indicated that an employer may be liable if an employee suffered an illness or a disease as a result of other employees smoking in the workplace. That was a matter of some concern to employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember vividly that in 1986 the federal Department of Health&mdash;which is quite appropriate&mdash;decided to take the lead and smoking was banned in all the department's workplaces from 1 December 1986. That was the first time this had happened in Australia and the federal Department of Health was a leader in the field. The department's action caused a bit of debate at the time, but it was the right decision. Over the years that decision has been confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a union delegate in the department in those days. My union certainly supported a smoke free workplace, but we had union members who smoked. There was an attempt to reach a compromise whereby smokers could go off and smoke in a smoking room or whatever. The department took the view that, as the boss had to pay for that, it was not a good way to spend public money. In retrospect, I guess that was the correct view. In 1988 the Australian Public Service as a whole adopted the smoke free workplace, and once again it had the support of the trade union movement, despite the fact that some union members were smokers and had some difficulty with the ban. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-smoking debate&mdash;particularly the debate about tobacco advertising&mdash;was also the subject of some colourful debates within the Australian Labor Party. I can recall that on at least two occasions at the New South Wales annual conference of the Australian Labor Party&mdash;which can sometimes be colourful events&mdash;a couple of very vigorous debates about tobacco advertising occurred. At the New South Wales conferences most debates are decided on factional lines, no matter what the topic might be or how controversial it might be. The smoking debate was not decided on factional lines. It was a very closely contested debate. The numbers were unusually close in a couple of those debates. There must have been a lot of support for the Left's hardline position on tobacco advertising in those debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was an alderman on the Campbelltown City Council and I recall that we had a difficult situation in relation to the Campbelltown sports ground. The Labor council, with the support of progressive independents, wanted to ban smoking in all council buildings&mdash;which it did&mdash;and wanted to ban advertising at council owned venues. That created a difficulty at Campbelltown sports ground because it is the home ground of Western Suburbs Rugby League Club. That club plays in the Winfield Cup competition. The club had to have tobacco advertising at Campbelltown sports ground as part of its qualifications for playing in the competition. That created all sorts of legal and political problems. They were not satisfactorily resolved at the time. The advertising continued. I believe that the passage of this bill and the subsequent phasing out of tobacco advertising will resolve that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this bill because it is important that we do everything we possibly can to encourage young people not to smoke&mdash;particularly in the context of sporting sponsorship. Cricket all over Australia, and rugby league in half of Australia, are amongst the most popular sports, both from a participant and spectator point of view. It seems to me to be unsatisfactory that for many years both of those sports have been sponsored by tobacco companies. I know from experience that both cricket and rugby league administrations have been proud to be associated with the sponsors. They have been loyal sponsors and have provided a lot of money to allow those games to develop. They have been very supportive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, I believe that it is a bit of a national disgrace that two of our most popular sports&mdash;we must remember that sport is about promoting health and fitness and healthy activity&mdash;are sponsored by tobacco companies. I will be pleased to see that cease as soon as practicable after the passage of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sport is about health and about our future. I believe that not only will the cessation of tobacco advertising for major sport be good for the health of the nation and a positive and progressive step for our health overall but I also believe it is in the long-term interests of the sports. Maybe with pay television and the debate surrounding it&mdash;with the megabucks coming in to carry sport on television&mdash;some of this debate might be irrelevant in a few years time. Nevertheless, I think it is in the long-term interests of the sporting codes as well as the health of the nation that we get tobacco sponsorship out of sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that sponsorship for major sport, especially these days, is very important. Many major sports would not survive without it. But for their long-term benefit, for their long-term ability to survive as sports that attract young people as players and as spectators, it is in their interests not to be associated with products like tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to support this legislation. Hopefully it will clear up some of the problems that seem to have arisen from previous legislation. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent the people who grow tobacco in the state of Victoria. As many honourable members know, there is a very large section of the rural economy in north-eastern Victoria&mdash;mainly in Myrtleford and the valleys surrounding it&mdash;where, for many years, hardworking families have grown tobacco. Many of them were from other countries originally, from Italy particularly. They are very highly respected and good citizens of our nation but they have been the meat in the sandwich in the debate surrounding the use of tobacco in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, until recent changes to the law, they could not grow tobacco without having a quota licence, which was issued through the Victorian parliament. We have had this odd situation where, on the one hand, governments, state and federal, have been attempting to persuade people through various ways not to smoke tobacco; on the other hand, federal and state governments have encouraged farmers to invest their capital and time in farming operations to grow tobacco. So we can see there is something of a paradox there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the difficult task of trying to represent those citizens as they are entitled to be represented, both in my previous life as a state member and now as a federal member. I wanted to put that on record to let honourable members know that there are a lot of very decent people in Australia&mdash;farmers who grew tobacco in the past and farmers who still do&mdash;who, it should always be remembered, are innocent bystanders in a way and whose rights should be protected and respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome moves by the state governments and the federal government in the last year or so to assist many farmers to adjust out of tobacco. There is now a complex arrangement between federal and state governments and the manufacturers whereby funds are being made available to assist tobacco farmers to get out of growing tobacco, to sell some of their smaller quotas to larger farmers so there will be fewer growers, and to readjust into other crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my area of Indi&mdash;in the Myrtleford area and the valleys&mdash;we are very excited because of the alternative crops that are now being researched and developed, such as grapes for wine. We already produce the best wines in Australia&mdash;Milawa, Brown Brothers and Rutherglen, which we all know&mdash;and now some of the tobacco farmers, some of them third and fourth generation, are plucking up the courage to get into a new crop, and they are doing very well. I predict that the Ovens and King valleys will become very famous&mdash;more famous than they are now&mdash;as producers of fine wine. We all wish them well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have a new industry being developed whereby mint oil is produced. Most of our supplies are imported. Our needs for confectionary and perfume are virtually all supplied by imported mint oil. Farmers in my electorate in both the areas I have mentioned plus in the upper Murray and Corryong are having a go at producing mint oil. They are doing quite well and it is a fantastic situation. We hope that these farmers who have worked hard in the tobacco industry will find a livelihood and a future for themselves and their children with that crop. It will help our balance of trade figures if we can replace the imported mint oil with Australian produced mint oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also seeing the emergence of high quality vegetable crops. There were some experimental crops of cauliflower grown last season in the Myrtleford area. I am told that the quality was absolutely phenomenal&mdash;the sugar content in all the cauliflowers was amongst the highest that has ever been produced in Australia and the crop ripened a couple of weeks earlier than the traditional crop in Australia. Our hope is that enough farmers will work cooperatively, with the assistance of federal and state governments and with some advice and research, to produce sufficient quantities of high quality vegetables so that we can supply some of the Australian domestic markets and also win some export markets&mdash;flying our fresh vegetables directly from north-eastern Victoria into the Asian markets. There are lots of good things going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to weave that brief summary of what is going on and to remind members that there are some pretty decent people involved in this debate. I had a lot to do with the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria as a former assistant minister for health and shadow minister for health in the state of Victoria. I always appreciated that Dr Nigel Gray always made it absolutely clear that his campaign to have action taken to dissuade people from using tobacco was not directed against the tobacco farmers in any shape or form. I have always appreciated that because it is important for morale and for what is right that these people be treated with great respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that I wanted to mention that, for the last 35 years in Myrtleford, there has been a very famous festival called the tobacco, hops and timber festival. It is a coming together of the community, which is also a centre for the timber and hops industries. The community celebrates its hard work through the year and uses the festivities of the festival to raise money for local charities. It is good fun, and everyone gets involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern of the festival committee is that, with this legislation&mdash;and Susan Burns, the coordinator, has written to me&mdash;it will not be possible to continue the festival, firstly because of the name of the festival, the tobacco, hops and timber festival; and, secondly, because the festival's success has been able to be carried on only with the support of some limited, but substantial, sponsorship by the tobacco manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you know, the act this bill amends and this bill deal with the future ability of people to acknowledge sponsorships. I have written to the government&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;on this issue on behalf of the festival and the community. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) for his letter of 7 February 1995 in which he says that the existing act does not prevent the acknowledgment of sponsors of tobacco manufacturers in the festival. However, it does say that that is the case until the end of 1995. The question the community wanted to raise was: what is the position for the future both under the existing act and the amending bill? I thank the parliamentary secretary for his letter of 7 February in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After that date&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the end of 1995&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">tobacco companies could still sponsor the Festival, receiving in return limited acknowledgment of their support.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that the government, through the parliamentary secretary, is acknowledging the relevance and historical nature of the event. The government acknowledges that it will be possible for the festival to continue to be sponsored in part, at least, as I understand it, by the tobacco manufacturers and, for that matter, the tobacco growers that will remain in that area, because it is the government's policy that there will still be tobacco growers in Australia. That is quite firm. Both state and federal governments confirm that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation should be cleared up. I would like the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) to talk to the minister and also the parliamentary secretary in order to give some further clarification to the future arrangements so that the people do not unwittingly commit a breach of the law. They do not want to do that: they are very law abiding citizens. It is important that we get the position right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked the festival committee to let me have a draft of what it anticipates its program would look like for 1996, a copy of which I propose to send to the government. I will ask the government to have some input into the preparation of the program, because I think we all need to work together to come to a satisfactory conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in the Victorian parliament I assisted in the drafting of an amendment to the Victorian act dealing with the control of advertising of tobacco products. Section 9 of the Victorian Tobacco Act 1987 provided:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing in this section shall apply to the annual festival known as the Myrtleford Tobacco Hops and Timber Festival.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very happy to say that the parliament of Victoria almost unanimously supported the continuation of this very important, historical and cultural event. That is still the law in Victoria, despite the changes of government&mdash;the Cain-Kirner government and now the Kennett government. There is certainly precedent for parliaments to give special acknowledgment to this sort of festival without undermining the basic thrust of the legislation dealing with advertising generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt then and I still feel now that there is a lot of hypocrisy by the governments, past and present, in this debate. They are very quick to take vast sums of money each year by way of tobacco excise tax levies&mdash;ever increasing. They use that to fund their basic budgets now. Those taxes are not allocated directly to the health portfolio so that we can expand our health programs. They are gobbled up by the general consolidated revenue appetite, and under Labor, an ever increasing one, and there is no way that this government&mdash;and to be honest, there is no way that a government that I hope to be part of soon&mdash;will be able to afford to give away in the next decade or so that vast sum of annual income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the government wants to keep the income coming in from the sales of tobacco through excise taxes but, on the other hand, it wants to go through these health programs to persuade people to better look after themselves, and I obviously support those programs. There is no quarrel from my point of view about the need for Australians to improve their health and to avoid activities that will diminish their health. But there is hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it offensive, to be honest, to be a local member representing tobacco growers in the state parliament and now the federal parliament now that it is legislating to exclude national sporting functions, such as the cricket, that so many Australians enjoy, from application of the prohibition. The legislation provides that these sporting functions can continue to be advertised and sponsored by tobacco companies. But when people who are the salt of the earth, hardworking people in the farming communities, want to seek an exemption for little festivals like this, it is not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the government's response through the parliamentary secretary, but I asked him, `Why won't the government give a specific exemption like the Victorian act does?' But, no, it seems we cannot do that. We are not allowed to. Translated, that means Myrtleford is too little. It is not significant and it does not have the big muscles of the cricket national television coverage which is allowed, under the present act, to have tobacco sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that hypocritical. I do not accept it as being right. It is time that the parliament picked up the opportunity to be fair to everybody, small fish or large fish, and acknowledge that there are some functions, such as the national cricket and other famous sporting events that attract so many visitors to Australia, where there will be a continuation of some sort of sponsorship by manufacturers. The Myrtleford tobacco and hops festival should be treated in the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the minister will take that message to his colleagues? It is given in good faith. I am not trying to make it more difficult for government in these matters but it is right, as the local member, that I put the request on record. I think there is a damned good case for the Myrtleford tobacco, hops and timber festival to be given a specific exemption, rather than its having the vagaries of deciding whether from year to year the program is drafted correctly so we do not have to face prosecutions in years to come. Let us try to help these people because they are damned good people and deserve that help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I extend a very warm invitation to all members of parliament and their families to come along on the Labour Day weekend&mdash;on 11, 12, 13 and 14 March&mdash;and enjoy the festival, the hospitality and the friendship of the people of Myrtleford, and to see for themselves the results of these people's hard work over many years and their contribution to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very good to see the degree of bipartisanship which is part of the flavour of debates of this kind. It has always been my experience in health debates revolving around the prohibition of tobacco advertising, to a greater or lesser degree, in the state parliament and now in the federal parliament that there is a significant degree of bipartisanship about these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certainly arguments at the margins about degree and about the extent of exemptions, for example. But with the exemption of one or two opposition spokesmen in the recent past&mdash;and I think that situation has now changed quite significantly&mdash;both sides of this House and both sides of politics in this country agree that tobacco sponsorship, tobacco advertising and tobacco consumption generally are a serious threat to the health of Australians at large and, in particular, a serious threat&mdash;albeit a deferred one&mdash;to the health of young people. Those are some of the issues I would like to canvass in my contribution to this debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any debate about smoking and tobacco consumption and the historical context must be considered over a very long period of time. I think the harsh reality is that history will judge Sir Walter Raleigh very sharply. I would not be surprised to find that he becomes known as one of the greatest mass murderers in history. In defence of his memory, I would have to say that, at the time, there was no way he could have known the consequences of his bringing tobacco to the Old World and starting the spread of that substance&mdash;that drug&mdash;throughout what we now know as Western society and, increasingly, to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to see just what the consequences of his actions will be. Recent studies have shown and latest estimates indicate that by the year 2025 cigarettes will be killing 10 million people a year. It is not too far off&mdash;some 30 years from now&mdash;that 10 million people a year around the world will die from smoking. That eclipses anything which any other person involved in trying to kill human beings has ever achieved. I think that kind of tally is something which we have to take note of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistics come in thick and fast. I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the House have indicated in this debate just how terrible some of those statistics are. But if we look a few years into the future we will see this on a global basis, which is the only real way of doing it when looking at the impact of tobacco smoking, and realise that it will be the cause of death of some 10 million people a year around the world. That really puts this kind of debate in perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we examine this at a more mundane and economic level, in both the United States and Australia, because they are the two countries for which more precise figures are available, we can see that the cost in dollar terms&mdash;not in terms of people's lives but dollar terms&mdash;has reached a staggering $US52 billion per year, which includes all the cost of things like fire insurance, damage and health related costs put together. In the United States, the economic cost of tobacco is in the order of $52 billion a year. This puts into some perspective the comments of the previous speaker about governments and their revenue raising requirements. I intend to say a bit more about that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at revenue from tobacco products, we have to take into account the very enormous costs to society and to governments at large of tobacco smoking. If we look at that $52 billion in more personal terms, we will see that it puts the cost of tobacco smoking at something like $8,000 per smoker per year. Of course, there are costs which go beyond the direct economic costs. Those people who smoke are likely to have 6.5 days greater absenteeism from work each year than a non-smoker. That has enormous productivity flow-on costs right throughout the economy, both private and public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the impact of deaths from passive smoking&mdash;the environmental tobacco smoke question, which is far more uncertain and subject to much more debate these days. In the United States alone, the latest estimates indicate that 3,000 to 5,000 people die each year from environmental tobacco smoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can translate many of those figures into the Australian context and look at the impact of 20,000 deaths alone in Australia per year. When we translate those figures into a more personal measure that each of us in this House can relate to, we find that we are talking about something like two of our constituents per week dying from tobacco related illnesses. If we think of it in that context&mdash;that is, two constituents per week dying from tobacco related illnesses&mdash;we realise the real cost of smoking to Australia and to the families in our area and the way in which that impacts not only on their own personal lives&mdash;on income forgone for that family, lost opportunities and the loss of loved ones&mdash;but also on Australia, the dramatic personal cost to Australia and the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the legislation that we have before us today relates to recent High Court decisions and the need to ensure that this legislation remains viable and is not able to be attacked at a straightforward level by the tobacco companies. The changes we have seen in the High Court recently have meant that we have to be ever much more vigilant about the way in which our legislation is cast. Something which would have been quite clear and unchallengeable a while ago is now subject to challenge on some very interesting grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent political advertising case certainly brought out the interests which we must seek to protect in legislation of this kind, which, in my view, do not go to freedom of speech. The reality is that this is a debate about preventing ill health, about saving the lives of Australians, young and old, and is not a debate about political free speech. Nonetheless, I acknowledge that the High Court is capable of finding those issues in legislation of this kind. Therefore, it is essential in protecting that greater good that this parliament ensures the legislation, so far as possible, is beyond attack in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very instructive to have a look at some of the words of the High Court in relation to those issues. The justices who looked at this matter&mdash;in fact, all six justices who were present on that case&mdash;held that freedom of political discourse was the subject of an implied constitutional protection but that this freedom was not absolute. Their Honours recognised that this freedom, although important, may be subject to more important competing interests such as national security, the administration of justice or other laws necessary in an ordered and democratic society. In order to determine which interests should prevail, obviously a balancing process must take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court indicated quite clearly that parliament was the organisation which should seek to find that balance in the first instance and that the role of the court would merely be a supervisory one where parliament had exceeded its authority. Justice Brennan in his decision stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balancing of the protection of other interests against the freedom to discuss governments and political matters is, under our Constitution, a matter for the Parliament to determine and for the Courts to supervise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of the court in judicially reviewing a law that is said to curtail the freedom unduly and thereby to exceed legislative power is supervisory. It declares whether a balance struck by the Parliament is within or without the range of legislative choice. In a society vigilant of its democratic rights and privileges, it might be expected that the occasions when the Parliament deliberately steps outside the range of legitimate choice would be few.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also important to note the judgment of Chief Justice Mason where he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . only a compelling justification will warrant the imposition of a burden on free communication by way of restriction and the restriction must be no more than is reasonably necessary to achieve the protection of the competing public interest which is invoked to justify the burden on communication.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this legislation does just that. The kinds of facts which I and speakers on both sides of this House have discussed&mdash;in relation to the burden on the health of Australians and the vulnerability of young people in this regard&mdash;more than justify the prohibitions which this act imposes and the further prohibitions sought to be imposed by these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, they do contain a number of exemptions designed to ensure that, where there is a legitimate right of free speech to be exercised by tobacco companies, they are in a position to do so and that the law does not necessarily burden or constrain them in a way which the High Court would find would impinge against the right of political free speech. This is not a US first amendment freedom as such; this is a right of speech which must be balanced against other interests in our society. In this case those interests are overwhelming. They relate to the health of the nation and to public safety. No interest, apart from perhaps national security, could be more important for this parliament to defend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at this legislation, it is important to take into account the reasons why we seek to prohibit advertising. It is instructive to look at the undertakings of the tobacco companies themselves. Philip Morris has been the most profitable company in the United States in recent years. Its profitability reaches a staggering level. In 1992 Philip Morris was the seventh largest industrial corporation in the US, with $US50 billion in annual sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when these corporations were ranked according to profit, in 1992 Philip Morris, with a profit of $US4.9 billion, made more money than any other company in the United States, which reflects the fantastic level of profits which cigarette manufacturers enjoy. The product is very cheap to produce and, of course, can be sold at quite high prices. With very small increases in the price of the cigarettes, they are able to substantially increase their profit margins even further. But the fact that a company like Philip Morris should be able to turn in a profit of $US4.9 billion trading&mdash;as it does&mdash;almost exclusively on the health, ill-health and, indeed, the death of individuals in our society, is something which should make this House and this parliament take very strong notice of. I hope that it is an issue which would also weigh very heavily on the justices of the High Court, were it to be required to judge this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of tobacco advertising is quite significant, and we can follow its trends over recent years. Indeed, in 1925 the average consumption was of the order of 1,000 cigarettes per adult per year, which translates into one pack of 20 a week. That grew very steadily and the main trigger for that growth was World War I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the course of World War I, tobacco consumption went up 1 1/2 times and then fell because of the Great Depression&mdash;thus reflecting the economic uncertainties of the times&mdash;but then grew steadily again until World War II started in 1940, at which point we were on 2,000 cigarettes per adult per year. However, by the end of World War II, we were up to nearly 3,500 cigarettes per adult per year. From that point onwards, it continued to grow until it plateaued in about 1960-65 at something over 4,000 cigarettes per adult per year&mdash;a very substantial growth from 1925 to 1965, from 1,000 to just over 4,000 cigarettes per adult per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That growth was clearly driven by a couple of things: the rise of the mass consumer marketing society which that period reflected very substantially; and the increasing wealth of ordinary people over that period, which was quite a significant factor. Also the contributions of World War I and World War II could not be understated in that context. However, the increase also reflected the increasing power of addiction of those cigarettes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once smokers start that habit, it is very hard to give it up. I have never tried myself, so I cannot comment on the reality of that. But those I know who have tried to give up smoking&mdash;the efforts of the Quit campaign, of medical practitioners and of smokers forced to resort to nicotine patches and the like&mdash;all testify to the difficulties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumption remained very high until about the mid-1970s when it began a downward spiral. As at 1990, we had dropped to just below 3,000 cigarettes per adult per year. These figures reflect a number of changes in society as well: the non-smokers rights movement which started back in 1975; the massive increases in federal and state taxes which took place during the 1980s; and the health warnings and the massive publicity given to the health risks associated with tobacco over that period, which resulted in a significant downturn in tobacco consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the impact of cigarette advertising, we see that tobacco companies, very wisely from their point of view, focus it quite clearly on young people. It is their intention to secure a market at a very young age, knowing that that will give them consumers for a very long time&mdash;consumers who will be quite insensitive to changes in price. If we do not ensure that young people are not caught by the tobacco habit at a very young age, we will never succeed in altering the health and smoking habits of older Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we have had very significant prohibitions on tobacco advertising in this country for some time, there are very few effective case studies&mdash;although if you look at the way in which young people pick up particular brands of cigarettes in different states, which reflects the outcomes of different promotional campaigns in those states, you can see the effectiveness of tobacco advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most striking examples of why we must vigilantly seek to maintain this ban is that of the Camel cigarette company in the United States. It is quite interesting to look at the data from that case. The Camel cigarette advertising campaign clearly has children as its principal target group. In 1988, with Camel sales declining, RJR Nabisco launched a marketing campaign featuring Old Joe Camel&mdash;a smooth character, presumably modelled after someone like James Bond. In the adverts, Old Joe rides motorcycles, shoots pool and associates with attractive women while smoking Camel cigarettes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three years into the campaign, surveys showed that 14 per cent of adults over the age of 18 identified Camel as the most advertised cigarette brand in the United States, whereas 29 per cent&mdash;double the number&mdash;of teenagers 12 to 17 years of age and a staggering 34 per cent of 12- to 13-year-olds believed Camel was the most advertised brand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more striking is another survey which showed that 30 per cent of three-year-olds and over 80 per cent of six-year-olds are able to associate a picture of Old Joe Camel with a packet of cigarettes. Among six-year-olds, the same percentage associated the package of cigarettes with Old Joe Camel as were able to associate a picture of the Disney channel logo with Mickey Mouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those kinds of statistics indicate very clearly the pattern in advertising which has been adopted in the United States to target young people in particular. The fact that those as young as three and six years old are able to so clearly identify with the brand of a particular packet of cigarettes is a very frightening statistic indeed. The cigarette companies have continued to pursue those policies right throughout the world, and particularly in developing countries where they hope to develop further campaigns which will ensure that young people in those countries with substantially higher population bases are addicted to the product as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco companies have never ceased to deny the risks associated with tobacco smoking in a way which I think is quite reprehensible. Indeed this has brought about a trend in the United States where the state of Florida has initiated very interesting legislation, which I understand is now being picked up by the United States Congress and which may eventually have to be picked up here. Florida has adopted an amendment to its legislation which insists that cigarette makers can be sued by the state itself for the health costs of tobacco related illnesses. In the case of Florida, it is suing the tobacco companies for reimbursement of about $300 million a year in Medicaid expenses for smoking related illnesses. That legislation is through the Florida parliament, it has been enacted by the governor, and legal cases are already pending in Florida. It represents a very significant legislative change in the way in which these matters are administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to be serious about tobacco control and tobacco legislation, it is essential that we pursue the kinds of advertising regulations and restrictions which this act encompasses. I certainly commend to the House, and indeed at some future point no doubt to the courts, the benefits of this legislation to the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Senate amendments Nos 1 to 3 made in place of request not pressed, and further amendments Nos 4 to 17, 23 to 27, 31 to 33, 35, 41 to 43, 45 to 48, 51 to 56, 63 and 65 (Group 1) be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak again on what the government believes is a historic piece of legislation. I want to begin by again putting on the record the government's motivation in bringing this legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the High Court of Australia brought down the historic Mabo decision. That decision changed for all time the position of indigenous people in this country. It recognised that there were still some indigenous people who could trace back their relationship with certain parts of land for time immemorial&mdash;long before non-indigenous Australians ever came to these shores. But, as we all now know, the extent of the existence of native title is finite and is, in the government's view, going to be far more limited than was expected when the Mabo decision first came down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To his great credit and the credit of the nation, in the historic Redfern speech made in Redfern park in Sydney, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it clear that the Mabo decision was to be a historic turning point. He made it clear that it was to be the basis of a new relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians, and that it was going to make a very significant contribution to the reconciliation process. The government then put in train a series of consultations and negotiations, which went for an extended period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those negotiations, the government developed a three-stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case. The first stage was the Native Title Act. That act will remain for all time as one of the great achievements of our federal Labor government. I believe that with the passage of time that legislation and the protection it gives to native title will gain the full endorsement&mdash;indeed, the unanimous support&mdash;of this parliament. Regrettably, it did not pass through the parliament with that unanimous support on the first occasion, but I am confident that the tide will turn and that, before the end of the decade, unanimous support will be forthcoming. The second stage of the government's response is the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994. I will turn in detail to that in a moment. That bill has been the subject of considerable debate both inside and outside the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third stage response has been referred to as the social justice package. That offers both the coalition and the government an opportunity to start afresh. It offers us the opportunity to look at the reports that come from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, of which the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) is a member. It enables us to look at the report coming in the month ahead from ATSIC and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. Those reports will raise challenging issues for both the government and the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is in the chamber, I want to say to him and the shadow minister, with all the conviction and sincerity I can muster, that the government will be seeking the greatest degree of cross-party support for the way in which we deal with that social justice package. It will raise some very challenging and difficult issues, but I am confident that, if we allow a proper process of consultation and discussion of these issues, we will be able to achieve a large measure of cross-party support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the Leader of the Opposition may occasionally think of me&mdash;and the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), would confirm this to him&mdash;I come to this portfolio with a genuine commitment to achieve cross-party cooperation. I hope that we can move back to a far greater degree of cross-party cooperation, if it is at all achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments the government is not supporting have been referred to by Senator Evans as the seven deadly sins, and we are not supporting the other amendments for good reason. May I take a bit of the House's time to refer in a measured and considered way to our reasons for not supporting the amendments. The government will be supporting a very large number of amendments and, even as late as yesterday, Senator Evans was prepared to accept another amendment, which was picked up with the motions that were moved this morning. This matter came on for debate in the Senate yesterday. My good friend Senator Teague missed the original vote and, as a further demonstration of the government's bona fides, the matter was recommitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the amendments concerns the requirement that priority of land allocation be given to the most disadvantaged in relation to their access to land or to those who are unable to gain substantive title to land. A number of amendments are opposed by the government because we believe they are contrary to the fundamental principles of the bill. For very considered reasons, other amendments are opposed because the government believes that they would make the bill unworkable&mdash;and this is one of the amendments the government considers would have that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pose the question as to what the definition of access might be. Is it to be defined in some physical sense? In some states and the Northern Territory, guaranteed access to pastoral leases exists in legislation. Can that be compared with the rights conferred by full ownership?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Aboriginal people in New South Wales, I pose the question: is the word `access' to be defined in some structural sense&mdash;that is, access to land acquisition programs or possession of legislative rights to claim land, regardless of whether the claim would be successful? If that were the interpretation adopted, Aboriginal people in New South Wales would go to the absolute bottom of the queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further difficulty in relation to people who may be unable to gain substantive title to land. In relation to people who have made a native title or other claim to land which they ultimately may not be able to prove, the question arises as to how they fit into this amendment. There is a great deal of uncertainty which would lead to great difficulties in the operation of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of further concern is the matter of assessing priority in the allocation of land fund moneys. We believe that should be left to the Indigenous Land Corporation board, which in the absence of legislative prescription will be able to take into account the diversity of the needs of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I turn now to the issue of grants to individuals and trustees. I ask honourable members to think very seriously about this matter. This amendment was supported by the coalition and by the Greens. Again, we ask the coalition to think very seriously about it. We think it amounts to a radical&mdash;I use that word advisedly&mdash;and adverse change in relation to Commonwealth grants to indigenous people for the purchase of land. If the parliament carried the opposition's view, it would be the first time in the entire history of Commonwealth legislative action in respect of indigenous people since the 1967 referendum that grants would be made to individual people. We do not think that is good policy. It is certainly not the policy of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's stated rationale for the amendment is that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be treated like other Australians who are not required to incorporate in order to have title to land. At first blush, that argument has some substance. However, there is a counterargument which we believe ought to prevail; that is, other Australians do not have access to the land fund. This is a special case of positive discrimination designed to address past injustice. The land fund provides an avenue for indigenous people in addition to that which is available to other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one on this side of the parliament has ever suggested that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should not be free to pursue ordinary means of acquiring land. Please do not suggest or think that we suggest everything for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia must be communal. One of my great hopes, which I am sure is shared by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), is to see an increasing number of entrepreneurial individual Aboriginal people&mdash;and I think we are already seeing this&mdash;making a success of investment, land ownership and business. But that is not the purpose of this fund. Again, that is one of the reasons why we do not support the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee established to look into the matter purported to assert that individual ownership was traditionally accepted in some indigenous communities. The committee referred to evidence given by Mr Donald Whaleboat, a Torres Strait Islander. When I looked closely at the evidence given, I found that the Torres Strait Islander was not asserting principles of individual ownership but principles of family ownership. Of course, that is a characteristic of indigenous land ownership in the Torres Strait. In fact, it was precisely the kind of communal or family ownership that was recognised in the Mabo decision itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I turn to the amendment relating to health, education, social and cultural needs. There has perhaps been more public debate on this amendment than any other. The government would agree, as I certainly do, that very much of the debate has been symbolic. The questions we pose are: `What is the amendment intended to specify? How will the needs be assessed? How will we quantify the difference that the land acquisition will make?' Either the needs must be assessed and the benefits quantified&mdash;in which case it undermines the whole philosophy behind the bill, which is one of returning the bill&mdash;or, if that is not what is meant, it is effectively window-dressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time it is important to make the point that the government believes passionately that one of the greatest social justice issues confronting this country is Aboriginal health. We have already had some debates in this chamber about that matter, and I am sure that we will have a lot more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition joins in that. Can I say to him that I think he will have to judge the government on what it does on this issue. I ask the House and the people of Australia to have regard to the Prime Minister's recent speech at Hopevale in the electorate of Leichhardt where he made the point that the government had moved in respect of native title to establish the land fund and the next priority was clearly that of health. There is much work to be done on that. Again, I would hope that, whilst we might debate the best means of addressing the issues, we ought to, on this issue, strive for our future directions with the greatest degree of cross-party cooperation on what might be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I turn to a good basis for doing that, and that is the unanimous report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rhetoric or reality</EMPHASIS>. I am getting some signals that suggest that it is in the interest of the parliament that we move more expeditiously. I do not think we have ever been so eager to accommodate each other as on this occasion, but perhaps that is not a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendments that relate to the Indigenous Land Corporation pursuing a policy of not requiring any consent for the disposal of land. Of all the issues that are likely to arouse enormous public opposition and public concern in the wider Australian community, it has to be this one. I have to say frankly that the government thinks it very bad public policy that we would allocate funds, perhaps, to an individual person and by law of the parliament effectively give that person a blank cheque authority to be able to dispose of the land the very next day. I pose a challenge for the coalition. I am not aware of any area in any portfolio responsibility in the Commonwealth where there has been such a policy. It has never been coalition policy before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Interest in land, I pose to the Leader of the National Party? It has never been coalition policy and it has never been government policy to allow that kind of effective abdication&mdash;and I think a rather cavalier abdication&mdash;of our responsibility as a parliament to stand up for important principles of public accountability. The government clearly cannot support that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the coalition's attention to the fact that the Aboriginal Development Commission legislation, passed by a coalition government&mdash;I think Fred Chaney was the minister there, although I may be wrong&mdash;contains a provision prohibiting the disposal of land in the way that the government is advocating in this bill. Section 21(3) of the ATSIC Act makes it clear that no disposal of land will be permitted in relation to ATSIC funding without the consent of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the public record that the ATSIC legislation has now enjoyed the unanimous support of the parliament. That is very welcome. The question I pose is: why would we want to ditch what has been agreed to be a fundamental principle of public accountability?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other amendments that I could refer to. Honourable members would appreciate that it is rather difficult for me when I am on my feet to appreciate the tenor of what the opposition might be about to do. I think I have anticipated the opposition correctly&mdash;at least I hope so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude my remarks by saying a number of things briefly about this legislation from a government perspective. This proposal to establish a land fund is something that has been an objective of mine for all the time that I have been in the parliament because I think it is very important that the nation address the dispossessed position of Aboriginal Australians. It is legislation that comes forward with all the hallmarks of good legislation. We have principles of public accountability enshrined, and we believe that we have all the necessary checks and balances and safeguards to make the legislation work well in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all else, the government sees this as the historic second stage response to the High Court decision in the Mabo case, and I want to take this opportunity to place on record the magnificent role that the Prime Minister has played in realising what had to be done to deliver social justice in response to that High Court decision. This is the second stage of the government's response. The third stage will be the social justice package. Before that, in relation to the budget, obviously health will have a high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, this is further reason why we on this side are very proud to be members of the Australian Labor Party. I would urge the coalition to think again in relation to its past opposition to the government's proposals and to have this legislation passed through today with the unanimous support of this chamber and that of the Senate to achieve the unanimous passage through the Australian parliament that it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I enter this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 for the opposition to say a few words as to our general approach to the whole question of the government's land fund legislation. Let me start by saying that we in the coalition believe very strongly that the amendments that were inserted into the original land fund bill were justified amendments. They would, if adopted by the national parliament, deliver a better land fund, a fairer land fund and a land fund that recognised the rights of individuals as distinct from the rights of groups and corporations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to take the opportunity to acknowledge particularly the contribution made by my Senate colleagues Senator Ian Campbell and Senator Chris Ellison. Over a period of months, they worked extremely effectively in order to insert these amendments into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside any detailed explanation of the constitutional technicalities and the times from which deadlocked provisions begin to operate, quite obviously we have reached a stage where there is a deadlock between the two houses of parliament. The Senate wants a piece of legislation that it believes, and I believe, is superior to that wanted by the government and, clearly, by the House of Representatives. If that deadlock were to continue, the people who would suffer most would be the people the legislation is intended to benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, the coalition has decided that, although on the motion of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) it will maintain support for the Senate's amendments, next week, when the second piece of legislation introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is presented, it will not vote against the passage of that legislation in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. We do that on a number of strict understandings that I want to make clear from the very beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those is that on the election of a coalition government, which will inevitably occur whenever the election is held, we will vote to amend the land fund legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate. I want to make that very clear: we will amend the legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate. It seems to us that that is the most intelligent way of handling this issue. The consequence of that will be that the Aboriginal community will not be denied the benefit of the land fund provisions but, equally, the inadequacies of that legislation will be excised upon a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second set of circumstances in which I make these remarks on behalf of the coalition is to say something generally about our approach to Aboriginal affairs. There is an enormous amount of rhetoric about Aboriginal affairs. There is an enormous amount of breast beating. There is an enormous amount of&mdash;how should one put it?&mdash;preciousness when it comes to possession of moral authority and compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Aboriginal affairs, no side of politics in Australia has a mortgage on compassion. There are many men and women of goodwill on both sides of the parliament who have been very concerned about the plight of Australia's indigenous people for a very long time. The fair-minded amongst those opposite will acknowledge, going back over the years, the contribution of many people on our side of politics to a sensitive understanding of the difficulties faced by the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an easy issue. I detect in the Australian community a general desire to see the condition and the state of Australia's indigenous people improved. There is a recognition by most Australians that, as a group of people, Aborigines are clearly the most disadvantaged within our national community. There is also within the Australian community a growing impatience with what seems to it to be the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars, with precious little advancement and, in some cases, actual regression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the government may say, whatever the minister may say and whatever the Prime Minister may say, the reality is that, after 12 years of government and the expenditure of hundreds of millions of additional dollars, the condition of Aboriginal health is worse than what it was when you came to power, in many crucial respects. That is the fact. If we are to have an intelligent debate about Aboriginal affairs, it ought to focus on issues like that and not be distracted as to who is taking the most morally superior position when it comes to responses to Mabo or responses to the land fund. We can talk for days, for weeks, indeed months, about that and if, as a consequence, the most wretched amongst our number are not advanced or not promoted&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We hear lots of speeches about how every so often those who represent the people of Australia in this building ought to look beyond the short-term political point or the political advantage. We have done that. We are acknowledging that, if the deadlock continues, you opposite will not suffer and we over here will not suffer; but the people the land fund is meant to develop will suffer. We are not going to be a party to that. We are, therefore, going to take the course of action that I have indicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear to those who sit opposite that they do not have a mortgage on compassion. As my colleague the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), the shadow minister for health, said yesterday, it is not a problem that additional dollars alone can solve although, obviously, financial provision is tremendously important. It goes to a lot of other things as well. There is an obligation on all of us to address those other things, but addressing those other things has to occur within a number of important guidelines and understandings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those guidelines and understandings so far as the coalition is concerned now, and will always be so far as the Liberal and National parties are concerned, is that Aboriginal affairs has to be addressed within the concept of a single, undivided nation of which all Australians, whether indigenous Australians or other Australians, are treated equally, governed by a common set of laws to which all of us are equally accountable and governed by a number of common values and common principles as Australian citizens. It will never be part of the policy of the Liberal and National parties to see the development of Aboriginal affairs policy within the concept of the tribalisation or fragmentation of this nation. We are one people and one nation, with one future, and one common obligation to treat each of us with dignity and respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the debate on Aboriginal affairs from now on will focus on policies and measures that improve the dignity, the independence, the lifestyle, the health, the education, the employment prospects and the family stability of Australia's Aborigines. It ought not to be distracted by arguments as to who is more compassionate. It ought not to be distracted by challengeable concepts of intergenerational guilt. Of course injustices were done to the original people, but those injustices were not committed by current generations of Australians and, so far as I am concerned, I am not going to be a party to the guilt industry, but I am going to be a party to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the minister says he is not a party to the guilt industry. I am delighted to hear that, and I hope his acknowledgment is recorded. What this parliament has to do is to embrace commonsense, contemporary policies to improve the conditions of Aborigines&mdash;to improve their self-respect, their independence and their self-reliance. Those policies have to be developed not within the context of notions of intergenerational guilt and not within the context of the fragmentation of this country but within the context of the unity of this country under a common set of Australian values and a common body of law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, what the coalition has decided to do on this legislation is against a background of press comment about a double dissolution. I would love to have an election at the present time, and all of my colleagues over here would love to have an election at the present time. The only people who do not want to have an election at the present time are those who sit opposite. So this decision taken by the coalition has nothing at all to do with question of the timing of elections. We would love to have an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister wants to have an election on this or indeed any other issue he only has to hop in that flagless white car of his and go out to Yarralumla and advise the Governor-General to grant him a double dissolution. This decision has absolutely nothing to do with that. This decision has been taken by us because we believe that, given that there is a clear deadlock between the two houses of parliament, the people who will suffer from that deadlock will be the Aboriginal community of Australia. In those circumstances, the sensible, proper thing to do, having regard to the interests of the Aboriginal community of Australia, is to do what the coalition has resolved to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will maintain, by voting against the minister's motion, a demonstration of support for the Senate amendments. But when the bill introduced by the Prime Minister comes on for debate next week, we will not vote against that legislation in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. Upon the election of a Howard-Fischer government, whenever that occurs, we will act to amend the land fund legislation to bring it into line with what has been passed by the Senate. In that fashion, we not only serve the interests of the Aboriginal community but we also produce better legislation and, most importantly, we return debate on Aboriginal affairs to areas of government accountability where it ought to be. We will also return the general political and economic debate of this community to the other failings of the government and all the other areas of government accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If any members opposite imagine that the behaviour of the Prime Minister and the government over the past few days on this issue has been some kind of clever political tactic, I think they are sadly wrong.

There, in its entirety, is the message to the Australian community. These people are absolutely disingenuous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also interesting is that whilst the Leader of the Opposition has spoken about the need for a cohesive approach to this particular issue, an issue on which we join him&mdash;we would say there is a need for a cohesive approach, that we should have a national bipartisan approach to these issues&mdash;what he has demonstrated in his contribution is an absolute and fundamental misunderstanding about the thrust of the land fund bill. What he has done by supporting the proposals which have come from the Senate is to indicate absolutely that he has no idea about the importance of land and its relationship to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has entirely ignored the evidence put forward on any number of occasions by royal commissioners, Aboriginal leadership and politicians. The government has indicated in the Senate that so clearly is it committed to the idea of bipartisanship that it accepted 29 amendments proposed in that other place. But it has, quite rightly, chosen to reject what Senator Gareth Evans has called the seven deadly sins. It was the opposition leader's support of the seven deadly sins that should have us concerned and should be of concern to the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to those points but before I do I want to make a general observation about the proposals in the opposition leader's speech on the One Nation concept&mdash;the idea that we are all governed by a common law. We all understand that; no-one questions it. But what we are arguing is that we need to deal specially and differently in some cases with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They need to be given special recognition in law as a result of past injustices about which he spoke. We acknowledged their alienation from their land base by passing the Mabo legislation and, prior to that, the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory; and we are looking at this land fund bill and the social justice package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge the need to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people special treatment. We acknowledge the need to address special needs. We acknowledge the need to address the principles in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander law. That is the difference. The relationship with land is integral and key to that. The Leader of the Opposition has also said the opposition is not about a guilt trip. No-one is; but he refers to the injustices of the past without acknowledging the injustices of the present. That is another key failing of his contribution and of the proposals which have been put by the opposition. He has a fundamental lack of understanding about the injustices to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are subjected in this nation today. </PARA>

In it, they talk about rights and entitlements. They have acknowledged the primacy of Aboriginal interest in land and the need to address that land issue quite separately but in conjunction with issues to deal with health and housing. They understand that, unless we address this land issue, the possibility of getting a fruitful outcome in health and education is more difficult. That goes to statements which have been made by various Aboriginal leaders over at least the history of Australia's occupation by non-Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at the contribution which the opposition leader has made I become alarmed that he has demonstrated no understanding of these things. If we are going to express bipartisan support, we must at least agree on the fundamentals. It is difficult to understand what fundamental agreements we might have, if we have a basic disagreement about the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the way it ought to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about how land should be dealt with, I note that the opposition has said that it should be made available to individuals and trustees. I wonder why the opposition has not had the wisdom to read what the various reports, which have been presented to government over the last 20 years by learned people in the form of royal commissions&mdash;the Woodward commission, the Seaman inquiry for the Western Australian government&mdash;have said about the nature of land, land ownership and title. What all of them have done is reject the notion that land should be made available to an individual. In fact, they have said&mdash;as they have committed themselves to understanding the nature of Aboriginal association with land&mdash;that land ownership must be inalienable; it should not be sold; it should not be dealt with in a way in which non-Aboriginal people deal with land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land is fundamental to Aboriginal spirituality, yet it is something which the opposition will not understand. The opposition still purports to be dealing with the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;indeed the interests of the Australian community&mdash;by going down this path. It says that people should be able to deal with this land&mdash;which, after all, is recognition of their spiritual attachment&mdash;as if they were real estate agents. They are not real estate agents. I have lived and worked with Aboriginal people for many years and I have not heard one Aboriginal person put this view. We have had the land rights act operating in the Northern Territory since 1976&mdash;inalienable freehold title. Not one Aboriginal person that I have spoken to in the Northern Territory has put the view that they want individual ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the position with regard to ATSIC. It is very important that we understand this. What the opposition is doing by taking the approach that it has taken thus far and by adopting the approach that the Leader of the Opposition has put forward this morning&mdash;that, in the unlikely event it were to get power, it would turn over this legislation&mdash;is absolutely pulling the rug from underneath any semblance of recognition of ATSIC and the authority it might have in the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander community. We should be very aware of the position of ATSIC. The ATSIC commissioners have made their position abundantly clear on numerous occasions. Lois O'Donoghue and Charlie Perkins have, at various times&mdash;</PARA>

There was a group of representatives from across the top end of the Northern Territory, each one of them representing a view of their communities. They were a representative group. You might not like it, but they were representative. The fact is that ATSIC is representative. You don't like it, but it is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition should understand what it is doing. Not only are you disparaging this land fund bill; you are also disparaging the representative nature of ATSIC, the ATSIC commissioners and the prestige with which they are held in the Aboriginal community. This is what you are doing. We have the shadow spokesperson basically saying that ATSIC leadership does not consult and does not represent Aboriginal people. Is that not what you are saying? The ATSIC leadership has made it clear where they stand on the land fund bill. They have said to the government that they want this bill, not your bill, and you should support it. But what you are saying is that if you get into government you will totally undermine the basis of this legislation. How disingenuous are you?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has now felt the blowtorch to the belly and caved in. That is what this is about.

We have got the opposition falling to pieces, falling away, in terms of its attitude to the land fund bill in this parliament. But it is saying to the Australian community that, if and when it is elected, it will change this bill to reflect the hideous prospect which was proposed by the Senate. The only reason that they have come in here today to give in, if you like, is not, as the Leader of the Opposition says, the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; it is as a result of self-interest. That needs to be properly understood. Nevertheless, self-interest is a legitimate interest and we accept the support of the opposition on this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are considering this legislation on the eve of another major ruling by the full bench of the High Court of Australia in relation to Mabo. I think in November the High Court finally took oral evidence, and some additional evidence was given after that. I managed to sit in for some of the full bench hearings here in Canberra on the Western Australian legislation and, inter alia, the federal Mabo legislation. The High Court is about to revisit the Mabo issue for the first time since its original decision. I point out to the House that that may well have ramifications for the core Mabo issues. It may necessitate another Mabo bill of one kind or another coming forward from the government. However, that remains to be seen and I am certainly not categorical about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I place on the public record is that, as we consider all the ramifications of the Mabo issue with regard to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their health, education and housing circumstances, we need to be conscious of not only the parliamentary deliberation but also the fact that the High Court is about to revisit this issue. I understand that there will be a further ruling sometime between now and the end of April, at the latest.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, when we review this legislation in government we will look forward, hopefully, to the support of the Australian Democrats and the Greens (WA). Hopefully, better still, the votes will be such that we will have a working majority in both houses of parliament so that we can get this right in the interests of Aboriginal people, in the interests of Australia as a nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I praise the members of the committee and the senators who worked hard on this issue across the board. The committee was chaired by Senator Ian Campbell. In addition to the senators who were members of the committee, a senator for the Northern Territory, Senator Grant Tambling, and others certainly put in a huge amount of effort to bring forward responsible, reasonable amendments which have enjoyed a degree of support. I do not say more than that. I say that those amendments enjoyed a degree of support in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait community. Once in government, we will pursue those amendments and, indeed, will this day vote one more time for them in the deliberations of the House on this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the legal side, it is worthy of note by members of the public and others that this bill is back before the House this morning because of section 57 of the constitution, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the House of Representatives passes any proposed law, and the Senate rejects or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on from that point. Ultimately, late yesterday, the Senate passed the government's original land fund bill. The government construes that it was so amended that it did not constitute a passage of the government's original measure. But that has to be then tested on the floor of the House of Representatives today in accordance with section 57 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had taken a view otherwise, it might be said for the record that, in broad terms, the trigger mechanism would have commenced from this day. But we do have the other complexity of the government arguing that the 1951 convention applied. The government lost that argument&mdash;in fact, Minister Evans ran up the white flag on that particular argument last night when he conceded he was wrong in saying that the trigger started back on 28 November. There was a very good reason for saying that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That 1951 convention involved a bill that was deadlocked between the House of Representatives and the Senate and was resubmitted after a three-month period. On the second time around, the Senate referred that particular banking legislation to a committee. At that time, Governor-General McKell construed that as a failure to pass on the second time around and the double dissolution then applied.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, the Senate is yet to deal with this legislation a second time around. For the benefit of clarification, that ought to be placed very clearly on the record of proceedings here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways this is a very unsatisfactory circumstance. As we speak here today there is a degree of agony, a degree of absolute unacceptability with regard to the actual conditions that exist across Cape York, western New South Wales and the Northern Territory. I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has come into the House because he went to Cape York, I think, last weekend and perhaps saw first-hand some of those conditions. But I am sorry that the Prime Minister did not go to Kowanyama and see the conditions there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes a quantum leap of imagination to think that this particular measure will, within a short period of time, greatly improve the health, housing and educational circumstances of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders right across Australia. At the end of the day, that is what members on both sides of the House should be about, as those are the real issues of concern. The coalition has taken a very responsible position throughout the course of this debate for reasons that have been well stated by the Leader of the Opposition and, shortly, will be again by the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus). At the end of the day, we will be quite properly reviewing this in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the government introduced the response to the High Court decision in relation to Mabo, it introduced a bill for an act to give meaning to the notion that there was a basis in the common law of Australia arising from Aboriginal custom and tradition to accept that there was a title available to those who maintain a traditional connection with the land, and to establish who was entitled to that land, how it would be allocated, how it would be decided and what those rights might be. It was thus a historic piece of property in cultural law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of its introduction the government made clear that though this established in law a very great principle it would apply to those people who were still able to establish a traditional connection with the land and it would not apply to those who had formerly been dispossessed. Hence we said in the response to the High Court decision, to make clear the government's commitment to justice for Aboriginal people, that we would also introduce a land fund bill that would give Aboriginal people a capacity to buy land, particularly in areas where title may have been extinguished, where there had been a grant of interest for a short period&mdash;a pastoral lease or something as we saw recently in events alluded to in the remarks by Justice French. In those circumstances Aboriginal people could actually buy land and they would have a secure title to it. It was and remains a central matter in the dispensing of justice to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was determined to get the Mabo bill, the native title bill, through. We stood our ground against intransigence in the Senate, we wore the admonition of the then Leader of the Opposition that it was a day of shame, we withstood the attenuated pressures of the opportunism of the coalition parties in the Senate, and during that period the Western Australian Greens, and said that we would campaign for this, in the country if necessary, were there a failure to pass it. Our determination to get our way, our way being justice for Aboriginal people, paid off for them when the bill was passed at the end of 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with the commitment we made we then said we would introduce an Aboriginal land fund bill, and we did this. According to our commitment we proposed that bill to the House of Representatives, and then it went to the Senate in September of last year. From September until yesterday and today the Senate dallied with the bill, behaved opportunistically towards it, sought to undermine the central tenets of it, and then introduced a long, drawn-out process supposedly of consultation which only revealed what a sham process the Senate had embarked upon under the stewardship of the Liberal and National parties and the Western Australian Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, Mr Speaker, the Senate passed the bill, and it passed it with the amendments which the government objected to. Those amendments were to give priority now to those Aboriginal people who suffer the most disadvantage&mdash;as though, of course, there could be any secure test of the relative disadvantage of people or the relative dispossession. If one is dispossessed, one is dispossessed. The notion that the courts would then be asked to make judgments about these things was, of course, simply only a device and a sleight of hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem with it was that they wanted to see a reference to grants to individuals and trustees being made possible, encompassing the whole notion of the traditional connection of Aboriginal communities with the land, and the protection of that land in the hands of communities being put asunder. The third problem was that another requirement, that grants of interest in land have regard to health, housing and so on, meant that the character of the bill changed from being a land fund bill to an appropriation bill that was interested in health, housing and other things. That completely denied the bill its integrity in terms of dealing with land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth problem was that they required the ILC, before acquiring land, to consult with those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who had traditional or historic links to the land in question. The device there was that, without any resolution of some of these issues, the body itself would not be able to conduct its affairs in an executive way. It discusses the removal of the ILC power to control effectively the disposal of land; in other words, it deals with the right of individual people to hold the land and actually dispose of it. It also referred to a group of proposals relating to regional strategies, as though they should in some way impair the capacity of the fund to actually do what we require of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week the opposition parties had every chance to make a decision in favour of Aboriginal people without these devices, tricks and sleights of hand, and after this attenuated period, and send the legislation back with integrity to the House of Representatives for passage.

He is totally and utterly incapable of getting out of the gutter. Those opposite with grinning faces should really look at what they have put up as the Prime Minister of this country. He cannot under any circumstances get out of the slime or the gutter and miss an opportunity to play politics. He made a political speech in Redfern about how much he cared for Aboriginal people. Ever since then, he has been playing Aboriginal affairs as a political football. He has done nothing else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister had an opportunity today to come into the House, as did our Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and say, `This is what we are going to do. Let's address the issues that are really hurting people out there. Let's get behind those Aboriginal people who are dying. Let's look at the serious problems. Let's get this over and out of the way.' What happened? He came into this House and made the most feeble political points that he could make. He could not resist doing that. There is not one inch of statesman in your Prime Minister. He comes from the gutter, and he is determined to stay in the gutter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us look at some of the comments of the Prime Minister. He seemed to be a little confused in relation to which bill he was talking about. I am not surprised at that, considering the number of bills running around at the moment. Let me make this clear: we will not be voting for the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994; we will be voting in support of the amendments moved by the Senate. We are doing this because we do not want Aboriginal affairs to become a total political football and we do not want bills to be going backwards and forwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time to start addressing the most important issues. Let us look at some of the issues we have brought up in the Senate&mdash;issues which the Prime Minister believes have `gutted' and `undermined' the bill. He referred to the Senate committee `dallying' in relation to this bill. The committee travelled 12,000 kilometres and listened to 224 people. What did the Prime Minister do? He rushed off to one community. When the second bill is brought down next week, it is with great regret that we will put it through without the amendments asked for by members of the Aboriginal community at large. They have said, `The government did not consult.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the House to words of the minister when he introduced the original bill. He said, `We have consulted extensively, more extensively than ever before on this bill.' What did we find when we went around the country? Aboriginal group after Aboriginal group said, `We were not consulted. This government does not reflect our community; it reflects the community over there.' Aboriginal people are not homogeneous. There are different Aboriginal communities around Australia, and they were excluded by this government from participating in this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were not consulted. When they wrote to the government asking for consultation, they were sent the completed bill. This government failed to consult. We consulted with Aboriginal people, and the government did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I turn to our amendments. Those opposite are obviously not interested in what I have to say. I will continue my remarks for the benefit of those in the gallery who perhaps have a genuine interest in Aboriginal affairs, unlike government members, who have an interest in disruption and in playing political football. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the amendments that we are supposed to be discussing&mdash;these so `horrific' amendments. First of all, let us address the so-called health and housing amendment which we are saying is changing the nature of the bill. That amendment says that when the ILC is giving grants to Aboriginal communities buying the land it should look at what is going to happen with that land. Will the people be able to provide housing on the land? Will they be able to provide sealed roads? One of the big problems in Aboriginal health is the dust from the unsealed roads getting into people's eyes. Where there is not sufficient water for continual washing we get infectious diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings up the second point. Should the ILC buy a piece of land where there is no available good ground water&mdash;there may be water that is too brackish to use&mdash;and where there is no piped water? How is that going to affect the health of the Aboriginal people who move into that community? It means that we are going to see more pictures similar to those that we saw when Graham Richardson went to Central Australia. We saw Aboriginal people living in humpies in a state of health that is reminiscent of Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how the people in the gallery feel about that but, as an Australian, I am absolutely appalled and ashamed that we have people in Australia who live in that condition. I might remind those opposite that these people live in that condition after 12 years of Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment did not say to the ILC, `Don't buy the land.' It said, `Look, when you are buying the land for heaven's sake take these things into consideration: is there sewerage; how is that land going to be serviced by water; are you going to buy a piece of land that Aboriginal people will move on to and then find that they do not have water to wash?' The kids will be playing in the sewerage and will come up again and again with those infectious diseases that the rest of Australia has not seen since the last century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was this such a terrible amendment to this bill? It was an amendment that did not say, `Don't buy the land'; it simply said, `When you buy the land look at what is going to happen afterwards and think of the health of Aboriginal people on that land.' It was an essential amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What happened when it got to the Senate? There was a little bit of difference in the Senate. Suddenly the amendments were not so bad and the government agreed to pass them. That was a nice backflip on the part of the government which the Prime Minister has not mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to get on to some of the other amendments that are important. I refer to the attitude about individual trusts. The government has tried to mislead the Australian public by saying that our amendment meant that we would be handing land to individual people. If the government would care to read the amendment it would find that it said that the Indigenous Land Corporation, the body that buys the land, can give the land to corporations&mdash;which is in the bill at the moment&mdash;or individuals or trusts. It does not say that the ILC has to do this; it simply widens the options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) read from a quotation which indicated that corporations are not a natural form for Aboriginal people. For most of those people family trusts are a much more understandable form. We did not even say, `You have to give it to family trusts.' We said we would widen the legislation to allow the Indigenous Land Corporation to provide for family trusts as well as corporations if that was what the Indigenous Land Corporation so decided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment was simply to give the ILC more power to consider those Aboriginal people who are not comfortable with corporations. Does that surprise people? How many here today really understand corporations? When you ask an Aboriginal community, with an overall extremely low level of literacy and a non-understanding of what goes on in the commercial world, to form a corporation, you are really asking it to do something which is alien to its whole traditional culture. Yet that is what this government says is the natural form for Aboriginal people. It has decided that that is what is right for Aboriginal people and to hell with the rest of the community, and to hell with those Aboriginal people who came to us saying, `The government did not consult with us. We cannot live with the bill in this form. Would you please get the bill amended so it applies to us?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is very sensitive about our proposal for the extra $3 million. Most of the Australian public, despite our efforts to get the information out, are not aware that the coalition and the Greens in the Senate actually voted for an extra $3 million to go into the land fund for administration. The request was rushed into this House so quickly that I do not think that members on the other side even knew what was happening. It was in and out in a few seconds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a land fund. We thought that it was important that the money in the land fund be spent only on land and not be eaten up in administration, the way so much money is in these areas. We said that we would vote $3 million into the fund for administration but that that was all that could be spent on administration; the rest of the money would be for the purchase of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What did the government do? It said, `No way.' It rushed that request out of the Senate and into the House without any warning. I was in my room at the time. If I had not been able to run as fast as I can, I would have missed it altogether and would not have been able to tell this House what our position was. The Whip was given one minute's notice, and that is how long it took me to get out of my room. It was a despicable act on the part of the government, getting the request back into this House without allowing for proper debate on the extra $3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the government do then? It circulated amongst the general community not that we had voted an extra $3 million for administration, but that we had simply wanted to cap administration expenses. There was no mention of the extra money. It sent out letters to Aboriginal people, misleading them on this point, saying that we wanted to cap administration and that it thought that was an unreasonable fettering of the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the issue of traditional ownership. One of our amendments was designed to require the ILC to consult with traditional owners prior to the acquisition of land or making a grant for the acquisition of land. We thought it was an extremely sensible amendment and we are yet to discover why the government knocked it back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ILC is buying land for one group of Aboriginal people, it makes sense that, first of all, the traditional people be consulted with. If it is buying land for traditional people, that is fine. But what happens if the ILC believes that it is buying land for one group of Aboriginal people while there are other Aboriginal people who have traditionally used that land&mdash;people who may not have a claim under the Mabo legislation because the land was subject to a pastoral lease? Their Mabo claim has been wiped out, yet they have been traditional owners.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will be the result for those two tribes of Aboriginal people? The result will be fighting, argument and bloodshed. Yet the government, because it refuses to consider sensible amendments, purely for party political reasons, totally refused that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I sum up my reaction as one of incredible disappointment at the way in which the government has decided to use Aboriginal affairs not only as a political football but as a way of scoring political points when out there is one of the most serious problems facing Australia today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), appealed to the gallery during her speech. I appeal to the gallery to discount everything it has just heard from the member for Hindmarsh because she has just engaged in a total rewrite of history. Let us not forget that most of the amendments we are discussing here today were amendments that she brought into this House before she had had one ounce of consultation with any Aboriginal people whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major reasons why most of the amendments were rejected by the government in the first place was that she had not engaged in any sort of consultation. In fact, she was told very clearly right across the board that most of her amendments were not acceptable to Aboriginal people. The opposition then set up this farce of a Senate select committee which spent a week at Christmas time running around desperately trying to get a few people in Aboriginal Australia to back its opinions. It did manage to find a few people who would say, `Yes, I agree with this one,' or `I agree with that one.' But the fact is that the Senate has absolutely no expertise in Aboriginal affairs. It is great at bagging Aboriginal people, it is great at knocking ATSIC and it is great at engaging in political campaigns against Aboriginal interests, but it has not done any real hard work on Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only really good intensive discussion of Aboriginal affairs in a balanced and reasonable way occurs in this House. We have the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which has been in existence for 17 years, and which I am proud to be the chair of at this time. It has a long history and, because of the work of that committee, we actually engage in much greater consultation amongst Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last five years I have been on that committee, I have visited probably over 100 Aboriginal communities and have spoken to thousands of Aboriginal people&mdash;a hell of a lot more than the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs has done. I know a lot more about Aboriginal affairs than the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make just one point. The coalition was able to get away with a lot of the amendments it put forward in the Senate only because of the unholy alliance it had with the Western Australian Greens. It greatly disappoints me that the Western Australian Greens were willing to sell their souls to the coalition on this deal. They put this bill through months of delay, forced through the Senate a whole pile of amendments and then did not even have the guts to stand up in the Senate and vote for it. They avoided it. They abstained from the vote. That is how strong their commitment is to Aboriginal people and how strong their commitment is to the amendments. They did not even have the guts to vote on the bill when it went into the Senate. That just shows you exactly what the Greens are worth. It is a worthless organisation, and the miserable two in the Senate at the moment will be decimated at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of the cowardly motives of the opposition in wanting to avoid a double dissolution and facing the people of Australia where they know they are going to be beaten, I am pleased that the coalition has agreed to vote for the second government bill when it comes to the House next Tuesday, because I am sick of the unnecessary delays that have occurred. I am strongly in support of this land acquisition fund. I believe it is a very important new initiative in social justice for Aboriginal people. I just wish the people on the other side would really start talking about accountability and start targeting state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget who has the major responsibility for the provision of health services throughout this country&mdash;state and territory governments. Who is responsible for building housing, building roads and putting in water supplies? State, territory and local governments. It is they that have been failing in their responsibilities. The opposition never talks about or accepts that. It comes in here and talks about states rights all the time, but it never talks about states responsibilities. It is about time states responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs started getting an airing in this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into this chamber this morning from the middle of a meeting with a subcommittee of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation where we are working on the council's recommendations to the government for the social justice package. I would like to spend the few minutes that I have available to me this morning perhaps trying to move away a little from some of the hot air, self-righteous indignation and accusations that have been flowing around and talk about some constructive things for our indigenous population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge the government to grasp the opportunity that is now clearly before it that this legislation is going to go through the parliament. The fact that we are going to vote against this particular piece of legislation this morning to support our Senate colleagues but have indicated quite clearly that when the second bill comes on next week we will not oppose it gives the government an opportunity not to have to put lots of its effort, energies, time and rhetoric into that piece of legislation but to now turn its attention to doing some constructive things in so many other areas of urgent and desperate Aboriginal need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that we all accept the importance of land to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The way in which that is expressed might vary from person to person or community to community, and there may be different strengths and views within this chamber. But the fundamental recognition is there and the coalition has accepted that principle with this bill throughout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we also need to be conscious that there are a number of areas where, unfortunately, the government's good intentions&mdash;and I accept that the minister has acted with good intentions for a long time in so many other areas of Aboriginal disadvantage, such as health, housing, education, employment and so on&mdash;have not borne the fruits that we would all like to have seen. The reality is that health is still a major disaster in this country. The one statistic that comes back to me repeatedly is life expectancy&mdash;18 years less for an Aboriginal male born today compared with somebody in the wider community, and for females it is 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the housing situation, we are talking about $2 billion just to catch up on the backlog. If we look at levels of education, we realise it is not just education but it is all interlinked. Health impacts on that as well with so many of our Aboriginal children going to school with middle ear infection that they have not got a hope in either the health or the education stakes. And unemployment is so much worse in the indigenous community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We clearly have a number of problems with the ATSIC experiment. Without bucketing, in any sense, ATSIC&mdash;and I have been one of its strongest supporters in this place&mdash;there are quite clearly a number of areas that need addressing, and the government should be giving it that attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government in dealing with these matters to go out and consult with the Aboriginal community on a far wider basis than it did with this land bill. I think it has had a tendency to deal with Aboriginal people who are elected to ATSIC, but unfortunately they do not represent the majority. They have dealt with the land councils but there are many others in Aboriginal communities who hold contrary views and who need to be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my role since I have come into this parliament I have been to many of those communities regularly and I can assure the House that although the government is claiming its views are so unanimously supported, that is simply not the case. I am concerned that the government has chosen to take a divisive attitude in so many areas of Aboriginal affairs. To hear the Prime Minister talk about the need for cross-party support and then come in here and say, `Now I am going to pull this second bill, I am going to introduce a third bill next week,' seems to me to be merely trying to take party political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the interests of indigenous people in this country would have been far better served by accepting that the coalition is going to not oppose the second bill and to then get on with the urgent business of dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage. The government is talking about its three tranches&mdash;the native title legislation, the land fund and the social justice package which is upcoming and essentially about rights. They are all important to indigenous people and most people in this chamber accept the principles. But we argue about the implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really urge the government to change its priorities now that it has a guarantee of getting that legislation through and to turn its attention much more to dealing with those practical things on the ground because when I go to Aboriginal communities that is what they tell me they want fixed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate's further amendments Nos 1 to 3, 18 to 22, 28 to 30, 34, 36 to 40, 44, 49, 50, 57 to 62, 64, 66, and 67 (Group 2) be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>As has already been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), only a Labor government could deliver legislation to produce this land fund. But, in debating the bill currently before the House, we now turn to amendments which have been agreed to by the government. In doing so, I must emphasise that the government has, once again, shown its bona fides and its good faith in agreeing to some 29 amendments made by the Senate to the land fund bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are not prepared to do is agree to amendments which are bad law and that would make, for example, grants to individual people on one day and allow the land to be sold off the next day with a total absence of accountability. However, the 29 amendments that we are accepting is evidence of our commitment to try to achieve the greatest degree of cross-party support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is now indicating that it will support the Prime Minister's bill because of the fear of a double dissolution. As the minister, I welcome the support for whatever reason, although the point about the coalition's motivation, which has been made in a very telling way, shows how scared the coalition is to face a full Senate election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the government's concern on a number of issues about the Senate amendments, we think that the additional operational burdens on the Indigenous Land Corporation are survivable if these amendments are accepted. We believe that one of them&mdash;a Democrat amendment&mdash;clearly improves the bill. It is the so-called `top-up' amendment, No. 57, which provides that, if at the end of a 10-year period the land fund does not reach the investment target expected of it, an extra amount will be paid from consolidated revenue to top up the land fund. That is a very important guarantee which ensures that after the initial 10 years the fund will be self-sustaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other amendments which the government is prepared to accept are technical ones. For example, the title of the bill has been changed, the minister will be required to table the national strategy in parliament within 15 days of receiving it and the terms and conditions which the Indigenous Land Corporation may impose on a loan is spelt out rather than left to the discretion of the Indigenous Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still other amendments have been accepted by us because they do not fundamentally offend the spirit of the bill and, of course, those amendments are incorporated in the new bill that the Prime Minister introduced into the parliament. An example of that would be the provision that the ILC must report to the minister if its obligations not to reveal secret material affects its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In view of the prolonged debate that this bill has received, and the fact that the government is accepting the amendments that I am currently speaking about, I will truncate my remarks and allow opposition speakers to make a contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will also make my comments brief because the government has decided to shorten this debate. I know there are many people on my side who would have a lot to say but, unfortunately, they will not be able to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I clearly point out to the minister sitting at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), that we would like nothing more than to go to an election right now. You know what would happen to you: you would be so far out there that you wouldn't get a look in. Can I say that, as a member with a marginal seat, an election right now would be great, because I can see myself adding to my margin by another 10 to 15 per cent. Let us have no talk about the coalition being scared to go to a double dissolution. The coalition would be delighted to have an election today, tomorrow or whenever you would like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I also point out that the coalition is more interested in getting this place running properly and having good government rather than having a government that is run by the larrikin that you call a prime minister, who cannot see beyond the cheap political trick. Everything the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says has to be political point scoring, and that is why we are in this state with the government today. When we refer to Aboriginal affairs, after 12 years of this government there are Aboriginal people still living in humpies, dying and without access to water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On these amendments that the government has accepted, after they appeared in the House of Representatives the government, through the minister at the table, said, `We will not pass any of these amendments. These are all terrible amendments. We will not touch them with a barge pole. Get them out of here. We will not consider them.' But, lo and behold, what happened when it got to the Senate was that 23 of them were suddenly not so bad after all and the government said, `Okay, we will pass 23 of them.' That is how much you can put on the word of this government: one day they are untouchable amendments; the next day, when they get to the Senate, 23 of them are passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that say about the integrity of this government? What does that say about the sincerity of the government when it originally saw the amendments? It says that the government has no sincerity in this area. It is not interested in anything else except politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have these 23 amendments to which the government agrees. Obviously, we are going to agree to them in the House. One amendment provides that at least two members of the ILC board must have business expertise. We moved that amendment in this House when the bill originally came up, saying that two members of the ILC board must have business experience, otherwise you could have a board with no business expertise running a $1 billion land fund. We put that to the minister in this House and the minister ridiculed it. The minister said, `No way. We will not consider this amendment. It is a terrible amendment.' He could not tell us why, of course. What has happened? It has come back from the Senate and the government has agreed with that amendment because it is obviously essential. What does that tell you about the minister sitting at the table and his ability to judge this area correctly and to be sincere in the area?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. I was shocked and horrified to hear an appalling statement by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). One of the Greens (WA) senators, Senator Margetts, described our new bill as a `sham'. The only sham revealed has been the incapacity of the opposition to get its act together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the Leader of the Opposition came into this House and said, `We don't agree with this. We supported the holding up of the legislation in the Senate for all this time, but we don't want a double dissolution, so we're going to let this go through.' And he confidently said, `When we get into government.' I do not believe that confidence is based on a great deal. A week is a long time in politics, and the next few weeks will show the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition repeated what his predecessor said.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZU5">Ms HENZELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Leader of the Opposition said  typifies the sort of leadership we can expect from the member for Bennelong. He said, `We are going to vote for this legislation and, if we become the government, we are going to vote it out again.' What can the people of this country expect? They can expect the same sort of shillyshallying that they got from the former leader over other aspects of Aboriginal policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate, once again, the opposition has no planned policy on Aboriginal affairs. Opposition members get up and criticise us because we have not been able to fix the wrongs of 200 years. But we have demonstrated a commitment to righting the wrongs of 200 years. It is indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who has shown true leadership on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the motion on the previous amendments, the Leader of the Opposition said, `We're not in the guilt industry.' I want to comment on this issue because these land fund measures are about Australia taking responsibility for its past. As a collective, all the present citizens of this country have a collective responsibility for past wrongs just, indeed, as I hope we would see that Germany has a collective responsibility for its wrongs done to minorities during the Second World War and just as we would expect the Japanese to have a collective responsibility for the wrongs done to our POWs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that we will not have any truck with the guilt industry is an absolute disgrace. It is my view, very strongly held, that until we as a community accept our responsibility for these issues and acknowledge them, as indeed has been done by the Prime Minister in his Redfern speech, in his second reading speeches on the two land fund bills before this parliament and in his speech at Hopevale, there is no real chance of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about land and is about the Aboriginal people's spiritual involvement with the land. There will only be a change in all the other issues that concern both sides of the House in terms of Aboriginal welfare and the need for infrastructure and an economic basis for development if Aboriginal people have some access to the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of this bill is to make sure that for those communities who cannot get justice through the Mabo legislation there will be access to land, independence and a return to their spiritual roots. I certainly support the comments of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). </PARA>

If we look at the areas of health, education, housing and employment&mdash;everywhere we look&mdash;it is a record of failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been in office for 12 years. What has happened in those 12 years? Aboriginal men still have a life expectancy 18 years less than me. In fact, probably almost every Aboriginal man born the year that I was born is dead already. That is the likelihood, and that is a disgrace and a shame. Aboriginal women have 15 years less life expectancy than my wife. How can we, and my friends on the other side of the House, talk about responsibility, commitment and guilt? If there is to be any guilt in this parliament today it is guilt for the inactivity and failure of the last 12 years&mdash;not for the last 200. We have to be concerned about what is happening now and in the future. We should learn from the past, but we cannot live there&mdash;we have to go forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is absolutely unkind about this legislation is that it cruelly raises the expectations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) at the table: what is in this bill for Torres Strait Islanders? I would be pleased if it could be demonstrated to me that there is one single benefit for Torres Strait Islander people in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was speaking I noticed that he made mention specifically of Aborigines. I wonder whether the Prime Minister, in all the 25 years he has been here, has ever made a specific reference to the problems of Torres Strait Islanders and the Torres Strait without just tagging it onto the ATSIC label. I have been through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as far back as 1981. Perhaps it has been mentioned in answers to questions, but certainly in speeches the number of times the Prime Minister has mentioned the Torres Strait could be counted on the fingers of both hands, and then it has only been tagged onto Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I do not think that is good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I flag this particular point because the Torres Strait is an area of great interest to me personally. I have a lot of friends there, and I go there from time to time. I am really concerned about what this bill will do for people in the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that this bill will cruelly raise expectations. Technically we are talking about $1.5 billion being made available over 10 years. Nobody should believe for one second that $1.5 billion will be there to buy land. That is not the case. It will be put in a trust fund and invested, and the interest&mdash;about $45 million a year&mdash;will be made available for land purchases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this bill is a sham, and I have believed that ever since the bill was introduced. It cruelly raises expectations. Already, $21 million a year has been provided to ATSIC for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to buy land, so there is a net increase of only about $24 million. I hope the minister will be able to inform me if I am wrong. I hope I am wrong because I do not believe that this sort of confidence trick on the indigenous people of Australia is at all appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister spoke about justice for Aboriginal people. They are being denied justice in the important areas of health, housing and education. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) spoke about the ATSIC leadership representing all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I do not think for one second that the ATSIC leadership represents the people in my electorate who live at New Burnt Bridge. The minister at the table will recall visiting New Burnt Bridge with me. I have praised him many times since then for going and I do so again. I also applaud his commitment, as he provided $2.3 million for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I come back to the fact that, although the money has already been provided, years later not a single house has been built and people are still living in disgraceful Third World conditions. They complained to the Ombudsman because of a dispute with the regional office of ATSIC at Lismore. What has ATSIC done? It has taken out injunctions to stop the Ombudsman's report going to this minister, the Prime Minister and this parliament. I do not believe ATSIC enjoys the confidence of all Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people at all. In fact, I know that to be true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will complete my remarks so the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) will have at least a couple of minutes to speak. This bill is not what it seems. It provides about an extra $24 million a year in new money for 10 years, and it is not going to do what is required of it. I come back to the point that we must solve the health, housing, education and employment problems. We have had 12 years of failure by the present government. It should face up to the event. I say this to all of those on the government side who talk about elections: if you want an election, bring one on now. We are ready and we will beat you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the couple of minutes available to me, I would like to respond to some of the silly criticisms made by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). In this debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill we really should not be making those sorts of criticisms. We should take a bipartisan approach to assisting Aboriginal people. It is all very well for the member for Cowper to blame everything on the last 12 years, but I suggest we should look at what has happened in the last 200 years or so. That is the big problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until all of us in this place sit down and work together on this issue&mdash;instead of the nonsense opposition members have been going on with over the last few months&mdash;we are never going to assist the Aboriginal people in this country. It really is disgraceful that opposition members have carried on in the manner they have. They have dragged out this whole process and then have come in here today and caved in. They should have done months ago what they have done today, even though, as the Prime Minister and other speakers today have said, they have done it only for their own political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members really carry on in a disgraceful way. They have been dishonest throughout this whole process. They have been dishonest with their own constituencies and certainly the people of Australia. Some of the stupid amendments put up by opposition members&mdash;such as having land entrusted to people in their individual names&mdash;would not achieve anything this bill is trying to achieve. That is why we have been trying to convince them all the time. They are not being honest with the people of Australia on this, and it is about time they were. It is about time they really worked in the best interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I rise to make a statement about shipping in and around our unique national treasure, the Great Barrier Reef. Presently, ships use two routes to traverse the reef. What is known as the inner route travels from the Torres Strait in the north, to Gladstone in the south. The alternative route&mdash;the outer route&mdash;commences in the Prince of Wales Channel, leaves the Torres Strait at Bligh Entrance, and continues southwards through the Coral Sea to Sandy Cape, just south of Gladstone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All ships entering and leaving the inner and outer routes have to cross the Torres Strait. At present, pilotage is compulsory in the inner route between Cairns and the Torres Strait for all oil and chemical tankers and liquid natural gas carriers, regardless of size, and all other ships over 70 metres in length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most hazardous parts of the reef to navigate are in the Torres Strait and in the northern section of the inner passage. Narrow channels, strong tides and the presence of fishing boats all enhance the risk of a grounding. Furthermore, in the case of the outer route, the process of skirting the reef and the largely uncharted waters pose a similar risk of grounding. With some 87 million tonnes of international trade&mdash;mostly Australian exports&mdash;shipped through the region annually, this ever present danger is a matter of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Altogether, there are some 2,100 local and international vessel movements annually, including 1,700 through the inner route, 600 of which do not call at any Queensland port inside the reef. This leaves some 400 vessels using the outer route. Whilst pilotage in the inner route is, as I said, mandatory for all oil and chemical tankers, liquid natural gas carriers and other ships over 70 metres in length, it is not compulsory in the international waters of the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each year, 30 loaded oil tankers enter the Torres Strait and transit the inner route, while a similar number travel north along the inner route under ballast. Twenty tankers transit the outer route southward. The government considers that there is no compelling reason for those 30 tankers not to join the 20 tankers using the outer route southward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few Australians would think of the Great Barrier Reef as a shipping lane. It is seen by most as a precious natural asset&mdash;and, indeed, it is. That is certainly the view of the government, and that is why we are determined to take all reasonable steps to minimise the potential for shipping disaster. But in doing so we must strike a balance between protecting the natural environment and maintaining viable shipping lanes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already taken a number of significant steps to safeguard the reef and to improve safety in shipping. Last September I announced new administrative procedures for issuing single voyage permits to foreign vessels. This places an obligation on shippers to undertake thorough safety checks before chartering foreign vessels. This condition came into effect this week. In addition, shippers applying for permits involving bulk carriers and all types of tankers must now certify vital information on the condition of the ship, as well as the qualifications of its crew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the government's response to the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, targeted inspections have doubled and now more than one in two foreign flagged vessels are subject to inspection when they call into Australian ports. This rigorous inspection regime has unquestionably deterred substandard shippers from calling into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Today we can boast the toughest inspection regime in the world; one in which monthly ship detention reports are published to bring substandard shipping to worldwide attention. In terms of the reef itself, by introducing a regime of compulsory pilotage for the inner route in October 1991, Australia made this transit route one of the world's few recognised compulsory pilotage areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, in October 1993, the government announced a detailed review of shipping in the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. We did so to ensure that the management of shipping operations maximises environmental protection and minimises the risk of accidents and pollution. This review has been conducted in conjunction with the Queensland government. A wide range of interested parties, including the shipping industry and environmental groups, has been consulted. The report is presently being finalised and will be released by the government soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, today I want to announce a number of initiatives that will improve the safety of shipping in the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. The initiatives involve minimising shipping pressure on the inner route; additional steps to improve the safety of ships that use the inner route; improved navigational safety in the Torres Strait; and improving the safety and the reliability of the outer route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are undertaking these initiatives in the knowledge that many vessels use the Great Barrier Reef inner route because of a lack of suitable charting of the outer route through the Coral Sea. In order to improve the charting of the outer reef, I can today announce that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, will provide funding for the production of these charts. The task will involve surveying that will begin at Bramble Cay in the eastern approaches to the Torres Strait and go down the Queensland coast to the end of the reef just north of Fraser Island, a total distance of some 2,000 kilometres. Once this charting is done, those vessels not calling at Queensland ports that currently use the inner route, will, unless there are exceptional circumstances, have absolutely no reason to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simultaneously with this charting, AMSA will proceed with the introduction of a mandatory ship reporting regime for the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait. AMSA will also seek to implement a reporting system with the agreement of the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, and will aim to have the measures in place before the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile I can assure the House that the Queensland government has been cooperating with the Commonwealth in moving towards the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover both the North East Channel and the Torres Strait. The Commonwealth is very grateful for the Queensland government's assistance with this task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together, AMSA and the Queensland government have been looking very closely at initiatives to improve maritime safety in northern waters. Extensive studies by consultants of potential high-technology solutions to the navigational problems of the region have now been completed. AMSA and the Queensland government are now negotiating joint ventures to ensure these initiatives can be introduced at the earliest time and in the most cost-effective way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first stages of this cooperative approach will be the introduction of a vessel traffic system to cover the Torres Strait, the Great North Eastern Channel route near Cape York, and the inner route. Extended coverage of this radar traffic system will provide accurate real time information and reduce the prospect of ship collision and groundings. This will be a vast improvement on the present situation where authorities rely on positions radioed in from vessels. It will provide cover of, and information relating to the important `choke' points&mdash;where channels are narrow and the hazard to shipping is greatly increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it will assist the Australian and the Queensland agencies involved in vessel traffic to enhance safety by monitoring vessel movements more closely. Extension of the compulsory pilotage area in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef to cover the Torres Strait area would further reduce the risk of groundings and collisions. After all, human error is the greatest risk to safe shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Torres Strait is an important and busy international shipping lane and Australia must be cognisant of the role of our neighbour, Papua New Guinea, and the international maritime community in seeking ways to improve safety in this ecologically vulnerable region. As the Torres Strait is a recognised international waterway, the extension of compulsory pilotage will involve comprehensive international negotiations. A successful outcome to these negotiations will be far more difficult to achieve than for the Barrier Reef, which lies totally within Australian waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked AMSA to pursue the question of compulsory pilotage in the Torres Strait. Indeed, it will now become AMSA's highest international priority in negotiations through the IMO. It is pleasing to note that around 70 per cent of shipping that is currently transiting the Torres Strait already uses marine pilots on a voluntary basis. Yet there are a number of foreign flag vessels which place commercial considerations before their environmental conscience. We now intend to seek international acceptance of the need to carry pilots in these waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While insisting on the greater use of pilotage in the marine environments, we recognise that technology is constantly offering new ways to improve safety. The latest differential global positioning systems, DGPS, offer improved navigational safety. With DGPS, positioning accuracy is better than 10 metres. This technology is now available and is being trialled successfully by AMSA in Bass Strait and off the Pilbara. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I announce the establishment of a new DGPS broadcasting station on Horn Island in the Torres Strait. It will be opened by October this year and will greatly improve the accuracy of ship positioning and assist individual ships to navigate safely in these difficult waters. With the establishment of this station AMSA will insist on the compulsory use by pilots of transportable global positioning equipment. This will ensure that all ships being piloted do so with the benefit of the improved DGPS navigational services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next few years will see the introduction of computer based charting systems that provide further improvements to all navigational systems on all types of vessels. As of now, a large amount of work has already been completed on this technology. The development of such a system can and should have implications beyond just the reef. It has the capacity to extend to all of our precious Australian coastline. That makes it a huge undertaking. Such technology is costly to develop but it is an investment that Australia must make in the interests of our marine environment and the safety of shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this day, shipping oil spills remain the greatest threat to our coastline. They are a constant threat over which we must be forever vigilant. Vigilance will help prevention or, in the event of an unavoidable spillage, the ability to minimise the damage to our marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government is in the process of negotiating a memorandum of understanding with Papua New Guinea on cooperation and assistance in the event of a marine pollution incident affecting either country. This is of particular relevance to the Torres Strait. There is already considerable cooperation with Papua New Guinea involving AMSA providing significant assistance to the PNG government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following a major review of Natplan in 1993, some 30 recommendations were made to improve planning and the capacity to respond to a major spill. Twenty-six actions have now been implemented and the remaining four are to be completed by the end of 1995. Actions relevant to the Great Barrier Reef include: the positioning of additional equipment in North Queensland and training for its use; development of a MOU between AMSA, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, GBRMPA, and Queensland for safe havens for disabled or damaged ships; priority for research funding going to a bioremediation proposal to be managed by the GBRMPA; and extension of the on scene spill model to cover the Ribbon Reefs area. Reefplan, the regional version of Natplan, is currently undergoing its own review, which will be completed in mid-1995. The emphasis will be on prevention, on planning and on a rapid response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When taken together as a package, all these federal government measures enhance shipping safety in this most sensitive of areas. We have a great responsibility to current and future generations to protect what is the world's biggest and most beautiful reef, one of the world's great ecological treasures. As a maritime enthusiast it gives me great pleasure to detail these important government initiatives aimed at protecting what we all hold dear. They are balanced initiatives, yet initiatives with foresight. I commend the statement to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your guidance. There is no doubt that, for those of us who have had an interest in this issue, this does advance the cause of protecting the Great Barrier Reef. A number of people in the chamber today would have heard debates going back over the last few years; there has been a great deal of concern and interest from both sides of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I was going through my own speeches from the last few years and I noticed that, on 28 November 1988, I said in this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Talk of damage to the Great Barrier Reef is of great concern to Australia, not just from a recreation and aesthetic point of view, but also from the economic and employment point of view.</PARA>
<PARA>In May 1991, we had the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill introduced into the House, and it introduced compulsory pilotage. Unfortunately for the those of us who wanted to debate the issue, the guillotine was applied and only the minister's speech was allowed to be heard in the House at the time. Certainly, on that occasion the opposition supported the compulsory pilotage that was put forward at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of issues in recent times. We have had bills about oil pollution at sea. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has spoken, I think, on virtually all of these. In relation to the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I personally support the amendments that relate to the prevention of pollution from ships.</PARA>
<PARA>Another was the Protection of Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 1993. I refer to a speech I made when I represented the opposition on that matter. We supported attempts, at that time, to investigate alternative routes outside the reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is an interesting point. The minister might like to consider the fact that, at the time, Caltex offered an $80,000 sponsorship to assist in studies on alternative routes outside the reef. I was listening to the minister's speech today, and there was no mention of that. I wonder whether that sponsorship was ever taken up. Perhaps, if it were, it would be a nice thing to thank Caltex in the process. Many people think that our shipping companies are not as environmentally responsible as people would like to think, yet there have been instances, as is the case with Caltex, where not only have they tried to be responsible but also they have put their money where their mouths are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Shell is another example. Shell's oil tankers have been travelling outside the reef now for quite some time, in an attempt made by Shell to ensure that it creates minimal risk of damage to the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, there have been a number of shipping companies and oil companies doing their very best to assist in ensuring that we do not have any accidents on the reef. Of course, there have been many others who have not, but at least it is worth noting those who have been helping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout all of this, from the opposition's point of view and, indeed, from the government's point of view, we have been very keen to do the utmost to protect the reef. The reason the minister is bringing this into the House today is that, whilst it would seem logical to have all ships go outside the reef, other than those ships which have to call in to ports along the reef, there have been concerns that the shipping lanes outside, to the east of, the reef have not been adequately charted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many old salts will tell you that the original charting that was done many years ago was done very poorly; some, apparently, was not done at all. A lot of the navigational aids are very old and not up to the task today. Of course, that has been a concern, because, if you do not have properly charted waters so that you can be confident that ships can plough through those waters without running into anything, it is probably safer to have ships going inside the reef where there are proper charts. With proper navigational aids and compulsory pilotage, that was probably safer than going outside the reef, at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the initiatives announced today by the minister will ensure that, over time, channels outside the reef will become a lot safer, with the addition of proper charting and more navigational aids. That is something that I think will advance a cause that both sides of this House would support: making sure that our Great Barrier Reef is protected as much as it can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compulsory DGPS through the Torres Strait is really an essential element. I have actually taken a boat, many years ago now, through the Torres Strait, and at that point you get the Indian and Pacific oceans meeting. You get currents that clash at that point&mdash;they go in different directions&mdash;you get whirlpools; it is really quite dramatic if you go through that part of the world in a boat. It is a very dangerous waterway. The channels are very narrow, those channels are quite shallow as well, and there is quite a lot of shipping that goes through. So it is really vital that, if we are to advance the cause that all of us in this House support, we get that international agreement, if you like, with compulsory DGPSs for ships going through that part of the world. It is something that we should promote as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has pointed out, computer based charting is something that will further enhance our attempts to protect the Great Barrier Reef and it should be seen as a great priority. I hope I am quoting the minister correctly where he talks of the time span for these things over the next few years, and I would hope that we could be more definite. Rather than just saying `over the next few years', we should actually set ourselves a particular schedule that we could work to so that this gives people the impetus to get on with the job, because when you say, `We are going to do it over the next few years,' you can never be confident that all the bureaucrats and diplomats that are involved in achieving these things are working at maximum speed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us, as I said earlier, have taken a long and deep interest in this issue. I have visited the oil spill centre in Geelong. For anybody who has an interest in this matter and who has not visited that centre, I think it is a very worthwhile thing to do. It is sponsored by the oil companies. It is one of our front-line defences if we do have an oil spill. That reminds me of the Auditor-General's report No. 9 of 1994-95, which was tabled some time ago now. That report looked into our ability to respond to a major oil spill, and in the process identified the Great Barrier Reef as a high risk area. I quote from the report's conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that with the technology currently available there is no certainty that a major oil spill can be dispersed before it impacts on the shoreline.</PARA>
<PARA>This is something that we need to be looking at also, that we must have the equipment necessary to ensure that we can deal with a major oil spill in this part of the world. The downside to travelling outside the reef is that, if you do have an oil spill occurring at that point, the winds and the currents along that coastline are such that you actually will drive the oil, or whatever chemical spills out of the ship, across the entire width of the reef, whereas, as happened in the past, where you come up through the middle of the reef you run the risk of putting oil over only half of the reef, if you like. That is a simple analogy, but it is roughly right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By going outside the reef we do increase the area potentially affected by an oil spill, so it is important that we also do what we can to ensure that we have got oil spill recovery facilities to ensure that if something does go wrong we can do our very best to mop it up. The one thing that we all worry about, apart from the ecological damage, is the television news reports around the world that would display our Great Barrier Reef in a very poor light, and it would do our tourism industry a great deal of harm. We all have memories of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> going down in Prince William Sound and the oil spill that was portrayed for weeks after that on the television. It promoted a bad image. We all remember the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, and we were very fortunate that that did not do much damage in the long term because the oil broke up and evaporated. So we really need to make sure that whatever oil spill response we have is adequate to the task ahead of us, and from the Auditor-General's view there is some doubt that we have adequate equipment to meet that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have got a book somewhere in my shelves which I acquired from the seamen's union; when I went on board the Trans-Tasman trader from Brisbane to Auckland some years ago they kindly gave me a book, a history of their union. I must admit it took me an hour and a half of getting my ear bashed in order to be awarded it. Rather diplomatically, I might add, I came second in the darts competition, allowing the leading trade unionist on board the vessel to actually win the darts competition. So I won this book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At any rate, there is a chart in the book which highlights the number of known wrecks there have been over the years along the coastline of Australia. It is amazing to see the number: hundreds, in fact, and many of them on the Great Barrier Reef. It is worth making the point that, just because there is an accident at sea with an oil spill, it does not necessarily mean the end of the world: the oil can evaporate and break up, and the reef can recover. There has been a tremendous amount of oil spilt on the reef, particularly during the Second World War, so all of these things need to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports these sensible moves&mdash;as it has done over the past several years&mdash;to ensure that we are doing everything that we can, through this parliament, to protect the Great Barrier Reef, the jewel in our national tourism crown. This is something that I am pleased to see that the Australia shipowners and the various oil companies support. With a sensible approach, we can be doing our best to enhance the safety of the Great Barrier Reef. I can assure the Minister for Transport and the House that the opposition will again be supporting the government initiative on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the need for continued budgetary restraint in order to consolidate the economic recovery in Australia, the government demonstrated its commitment to international development by increasing Australia's aid program by 3.6 per cent in real terms. This meant that we were one of only four of the 21 OECD donors who increased their aid programs in the last year. As a result, Australia continues to remain above the average for donors in terms of the aid to GNP ratio. Aid volume apart, there have been significant changes in our region, not least in Indochina and the South Pacific. Further afield, the transition to democracy in South Africa will change the nature of economic relationships throughout southern Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention now to significant developments in Australia's relationship with the South Pacific. During the run-up to the South Pacific Forum&mdash;which was held in Brisbane in August last year&mdash;I gave a speech to the Foreign Correspondents Association, highlighting the need for policy reforms in the region. The overriding theme of my address was the need for the region's governments to develop improved national policies to encourage sustainable social and economic growth. I am pleased to say that this theme was taken on board by regional leaders and, as a result, the forum generated an unprecedented level of commitment to improve economic and environmental policies, particularly in forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently, a code of conduct on logging was agreed by officials from forum island countries, and only last week a meeting of the region's finance ministers took place in Suva, at which crucial policy issues were discussed, including fiscal, forestry and civil aviation matters which have been identified as priorities by island leaders. In Papua New Guinea, we have agreed on a radical transformation of the aid program. By the end of the decade, the program will have completely moved from budget support to jointly programmed project activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Indochina&mdash;one of the poorest regions of the world, where annual incomes per head are less than $400&mdash;our aid program is expanding rapidly. In May 1994, we announced a four-year, $350 million package, targeted at the high priority areas of health, infrastructure, education, human rights and the strengthening of legal institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most visible examples of the effectiveness of our development assistance is the Mekong River Friendship Bridge. It is the first road link between Laos and Thailand and will yield substantial economic benefits to both countries. Moreover, as one of the highest profile aid projects undertaken by Australia in recent years&mdash;and incidentally, a project completed ahead of schedule and under budget&mdash;the bridge is an invaluable showcase for Australian capabilities in major infrastructure design and technology transfer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw members' attention to the government's response to the tragedy of Rwanda. The government has so far contributed $35 million to support the relief effort there, a contribution matched by an extraordinary public response of over $30 million. Australia's response was one of the earliest and, from my observations, one of the most effectively targeted of all donors. At the same time, and despite our limited resources, we have begun an increased program to support the peaceful transition to majority rule in South Africa by providing assistance of $30 million over three years. This program has been designed to meet the objectives of the Government of National Unity's reconstruction and development program, including through building up capacity in areas such as planning, economic policy and the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been important developments in the sector focus of Australia's aid program. In particular, we have continued to expand environmental assistance, and in this financial year, we will spend around $120 million on these activities. Amongst other things, this funding will cover the establishment of what we are calling `Green DIFF', part of the highly successful development import finance facility which has been the catalyst for many Australian companies to become involved in the region. Green DIFF will help to finance environmental projects in areas such as pollution control and energy efficiency, gaining wider exposure for Australia's environmental expertise. The last budget also heralded an Australian contribution of nearly $43 million to replenish the global environment facility, as well as an increase in support for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vibrant private sector is an essential part of the development process. Initiatives such as the private sector linkages program, which last year saw its budget allocation double to $10 million, are targeted at this sector. In addition, the informal sector is now recognised as a fundamental resource for social and economic development. Australia's aid program is reflecting this with an increased allocation of funds to micro-enterprise development, with a two-year $1.3 million package for development in the South Pacific and South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the role of the private sector in development is just one example of the way that the aid program has adapted to remain relevant and effective. Another excellent example is provided by this year's launch of the policy document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a sustainable future: ecologically sustainable development through Australia's development cooperation program.</EMPHASIS> I am sure that the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), would agree that this is a catchy title. Australia's policy in this area fully takes into account the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio by defining the importance of integrating the economic, ecological and social dimensions of development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past year has also seen the government continue to pursue policies on human rights and good governance through the aid program. On human rights, Australia's policy is to maintain a consistent and principled stand against abuses, while stressing the importance of continued engagement through dialogue and institution building. On good governance,</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's policy encourages the effective management of social and economic resources in developing countries in a manner that is open, transparent, accountable and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you can see, over the past year we have continued a process of review and adaptation which will ensure that Australia's aid program continues to be of the highest quality, responsive to the needs of developing countries and appropriate to Australia's place in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn to new developments in our overseas assistance in the social sector. The government's policy framework for poverty reduction has three components: firstly, encouraging sustainable economic growth; secondly, investment in human resources through education, health, capacity building and social sector development; and thirdly, provision of safety nets and poverty targeting, including humanitarian relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social sector provides a crucial contribution to sustainable social and economic development. Recent World Bank reports have highlighted the major role that government commitment to social sector development, particularly in education, has played in the rapid growth of many Asian economies. Reflecting this importance, the past two budgets have seen a significant upgrading of the already high priority given to the social sector in the aid program through the introduction of major population and health initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993-94 budget, we trebled expenditure on the population sector with a four-year, $130 million initiative. To ensure the effectiveness of this initiative, the government commissioned an independent inquiry into the links between population and development. This was one of the most comprehensive surveys of population and development issues ever undertaken, and its conclusions have been vital in highlighting the complex links between population and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of this inquiry have helped AIDAB to develop a range of principles which now guide our aid program's population activities. Among the most important of these principles is that access to safe and effective family planning services is a fundamental right, and that women should have access to a wide range of reproductive health services and should participate fully in defining the services they need. Above all&mdash;and I want to emphasise this as much as I can&mdash;coercion has no place in the Australian aid program's family planning activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority which the aid program gives to population issues was reflected in the major role that Australia played at the International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo in September 1994, at which I was present. Helped by our efforts, the conference adopted a groundbreaking program of action for the empowerment of women and called for major increases in global resources for family planning and health activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer to the significant developments in the nature of our assistance to the health sector. Funding for health was given a major boost in the 1994-95 aid budget, with the introduction of a four-year initiative targeting four priority areas: malaria, polio, neonatal tetanus and HIV-AIDS. This initiative involves additional funding of $110 million over the next four years, which nearly doubles Australia's current spending on health under the aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with our assistance to the population activities, AIDAB has developed a set of principles which will guide this new funding. These principles state that improvements in health are best achieved through an integrated approach which tackles the causes of poverty and improves the status and wellbeing of vulnerable groups, particularly women and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes are also afoot in Australia's program of assistance to education and training. It is true that assistance to the education sector has always been a large part of the aid program. At present, the sector receives an allocation of a little under 20 per cent of the total budget. The majority of that funding goes towards assistance at the tertiary level. We are now reviewing our assistance in this sector with a view to diversifying the kinds of assistance to include increased support for basic, technical and vocational education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt of the social, economic, health and population gains that are derived from basic education. At the same time, the primary responsibility for the provision of basic education lies with the recipient government&mdash;aid should not substitute for that responsibility. That means that our assistance to the education sector must be carefully targeted to assist and strengthen, rather than replace or duplicate, the efforts of national governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to talk about developments in the humanitarian relief program. One of the most tragic features of the past few years has been the continued increase in the frequency and the impact of international emergencies. In the past five years, over 300 million people have been affected by natural disasters and civil strife. Over the past 20 years, the number of refugees has risen from an estimated three million to 23 million, half of whom are children and most of whom are from developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a huge cost in human terms. It is also a huge financial cost. Just to give two examples: the annual expenditure of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has risen from $US450 million in the mid-1980s to $US1.1 billion in 1993, and the cost of UN peacekeeping operations has risen from under $US1 billion in 1991 to over $US4 billion in 1993. And it is tragic that this trend shows no sign of slowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forces which drive this situation are highly complex and demand an equally complex international response. Factors such as the link between poverty and vulnerability, the increase in political volatility since the end of the Cold War and the proliferation of humanitarian relief agencies have to be taken into account in providing a coordinated response. It was against this backdrop of increasing complexity and growing demand for assistance that early last year AIDAB undertook an extensive review of its refugee and relief program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of this review are helping the government to update Australia's response to international humanitarian emergencies. The review found that Australia's spending on humanitarian relief had not followed the rapid increases of other donors. This relative decline in funding for humanitarian emergencies is in stark contrast to the clear wishes of the Australian public, which has repeatedly demonstrated that it wants our government to respond generously to such humanitarian tragedies as those witnessed in Rwanda. AIDAB is already responding to the recommendations of the review and is also exploring opportunities for increasing funds for humanitarian relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia improves its aid response to international humanitarian emergencies, we also share a responsibility with the international community to do more to prevent disasters and complex emergencies from happening in the first place. This is a priority that requires a range of strategies addressing the underlying causes of dispute and conflict. We require improvements in prevention and response strategy through arrangements which minimise threats to security, promote confidence and trust, and create frameworks for dialogue and cooperation. We must also develop peace-building activities to ensure that conflict does not arise in the first place or, if it does, to ensure that it does not recur. That involves strategies which encourage economic and social development, environmental protection, human rights and good governance. Australia will be doing as much as possible through the aid program to support these activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the years ahead, I am confident that Australia will continue to deliver a compassionate and effective aid program that has a real impact on the lives of millions of people throughout the developing world. As I have said before, Australia's future, and the Australian people, demand nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Before I call the honourable member for Mayo, Minister, in your second paragraph you made reference to a report to be tabled today.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Mayo)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the issue of overseas aid. As I think the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) would be aware, on this side of the House we believe that the purpose of foreign aid is to provide for basic needs in two respects: first, in terms of humanitarian assistance; and, secondly, in terms of assisting with sustainable economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, though, in the context of this debate to outline what aid should not be. It should not be some kind of high level bribery or foreign policy instrument which is cynically used to advance a political interest rather than to advance those basic needs that I spoke of earlier. Secondly, aid should not be used as a way of circumventing GATT rules on international trade and subsidising exports. That is not what our aid program is supposed to be about, and in too many countries around the world aid programs are used for those objectives rather than the fundamental objective of the provision of basic needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House have for many years emphasised the need for community based project aid and have expressed in general terms our reservations about what often become big, white elephant, so-called infrastructure projects. Some of them are fine, but we have expressed reservations about there being too much emphasis in our aid program on those sorts of projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address three or four of the issues that arose from the minister's statement. The most controversial issue involves how much aid the government provides. In his statement, the minister claimed that the government demonstrated its commitment to international development by increasing Australia's aid program. That statement is completely disingenuous and the minister knows that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That statement can be measured against three sets of standards: firstly, the standards which the Australian Labor Party set itself before the last election; secondly, world standards; and, thirdly&mdash;and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) likes to do this in relation to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)&mdash;the standards of the previous government. During the 1993 election campaign the Labor Party promised to achieve an aid target of 0.4 per cent of GDP by 1995. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bilney" NAMEID="RE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is your policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Forget our policy. Do you remember your own policy, Minister? Do you remember going out there and promising that you would reach the 0.4 per cent target? Of course the minister remembers it, and of course the Prime Minister remembers it. How has the Labor Party measured up to its own standards? According to the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, the Labor government's pre-election pledge to achieve 0.4 per cent of GNP by 1995 was broken only six months after the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government set a standard, recklessly and deceptively, knowing that it would never achieve it. What it has achieved is 0.34 per cent&mdash;from my recollection of last year's budget, that was the figure. It would just about crack 0.33 per cent, in fact. That is well short of what the Labor Party promised Australians at the last election. So, according to its own standards, the Australian Labor Party has failed in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did something that it should not have done: it said one thing to the Australian people and, on being re-elected, went off and did another thing. If the government intended to reduce aid as a proportion of GNP, why did it not tell the people? Why did it tell them something else? Why did it try to get the votes of the aid groups in the community and of all those Australians who are interested in aid&mdash;which is quite a lot of people&mdash;by telling them one thing and doing another? You can get away with it once, but you will not get away with it twice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the government's performance against the standards of the rest of the world? Interestingly enough, it was AIDAB which gave me these very good charts. Here is one which deals pretty effectively with the minister's claim that somehow Australia has performed well by OECD standards. This chart shows movements in aid to GNP ratios, conveniently from 1982-83 to 1993&mdash;over the life of the Labor government. Of all the countries on the OECD Development Assistance Committee, Australia comes second last. Only the United States has a worse record than Australia in that period. That information was given to me yesterday by AIDAB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the chart so that the House has the opportunity to peruse the work of AIDAB and the record of this government: a record which does not match its rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave not granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shame of it. I will make sure that this is circulated to the offices of all Labor members because I think they should read it. The government should not say one thing and turn around and do another. The minister claimed in his speech that Australia is above the average for donors in terms of aid to GNP ratios. That is funny. The information from AIDAB shows the unweighted average and the weighted average in 1983. Obviously, the unweighted average should be used. In 1983, Australia was not far above the average, but we were above it. Today, according to AIDAB, we are there and the average is there. It is way below.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the mystique of the weighted average where just about the whole of the weighting is taken up by the United States and Japan; it is under the falsest of all ways of trying to measure your generosity in terms of aid. You know the unweighted average is the only intellectually honest average to use. You are trying to tell the aid community that we have a target of 0.4 per cent. When an election comes you abandon it. You are saying that we are being very generous and that we are above the OECD average because we have worked out some sort of construction of a weighted average which, if I may say so, is the most fanciful piece of actuarial work that I have seen in a very long time. On the basis of the unweighted average, we are way down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the most crippling piece of evidence for the Labor Party is that, according to AIDAB itself, our record was the second worst in the OECD over the last dozen years&mdash;that is, while Labor has been in office. Against the standards of the previous government, I do not really need to elaborate, except to say that in 1982-83, when we were above the OECD weighted and unweighted averages, Australia's aid was 0.5 per cent of GNP. During the life of the Fraser government, we had a record that has never been closely matched by the Hawke and, of course, now Keating governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could turn to some of the program issues and make a few points about them, first of all, given that the Jackson report was many years ago, there should be a full and independent review of Australia's cooperation development program. I do not know whether the minister and the government are planning to do that in the near future, but it would be a constructive initiative. If it does not do it within the next year, we will do it during 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs can look forward to reading about it. In your particular case, you will be lucky to know anything about what we are doing in government unless you read the newspapers because you will not be a member here. Kingston is a seat that we look forward very much to taking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have certainly nearly won it on several occasions, and we have been creeping up at every election. It got very close last time. The second point, though, is in relation to educational assistance and development. The government and the minister claim that nearly 20 per cent of the total aid budget is spent on education. That sounds quite good when you put it that way. But, as the minister pointed out, the vast majority is in fact spent on scholarship assistance at the tertiary level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair&mdash;and I always am fair&mdash;the minister's own statement of the need to review assistance in the educational sector, to use his words, `with a view to diversifying the kinds of assistance to include increased support for basic technical and vocational education' is a good statement and is very much in line with coalition policy. The more you read our statements and start to implement them, the more support you will get from us. There will be no hypocrisy from us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third point relates to Australian sponsored training scholarships. In the ASTS scheme, the recipient government nominates students, who are usually officials in key positions in that country's public sector, to study in Australian tertiary institutions. The minister concedes the point that, with so much weight given to that program, our contribution in terms of education is not as effective as it could be. I was glad to read what the minister had to say on that count in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as health is concerned, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid says that only 3.6 per cent of bilateral aid is spent on health. I do not know whether the government agrees with that figure. Over the years, health has been a seriously neglected aspect of our aid programs, so we would welcome the greater focus on that issue. There are things that are good and there are things that are less good in what the government has been doing here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue of aid and human rights. The link between aid and human rights must be reviewed very carefully. Obviously, we have to avoid hurting people who are the innocent victims of regimes which show no respect for human rights. That is a very important point to make. The answer I suppose is to decrease the reliance of government to government aid in those circumstances and to increase aid delivery to the community level through AIDAB and non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government basically rejects the link between aid donations and human rights. That has been the rhetoric of the government and, on many occasions, certainly the activity of the government. However, the government has suspended aid to Burma until the SLORC makes clear-cut reforms. Is the government, in rejecting any link between aid and human rights, turning around and saying that it has a different policy in relation to Burma? Or is it conceding that there is a role for human rights and decisions about aid volumes and directions? The government cannot have it both ways. I think the government needs to make its position on that issue much clearer than it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has shown a great deal of enthusiasm for increasing aid to Vietnam. When the Prime Minister visited Vietnam, he announced a very substantial increase in aid. That country, which is now by far the largest recipient of Australian aid in Indochina, does not have a great record on human rights. Vietnam's record on human rights has not been of much concern to the government. But, quite rightly, the government has been concerned with Burma's record on human rights. The government needs to think through&mdash;as I think it does generally with its foreign policy&mdash;a lot more carefully where human rights fit into its aid policy so as to articulate a clear and coherent policy. Then those opposite can escape from charges of hypocrisy as everybody will know where they stand. The problem with so much of this debate about aid is that the rhetoric comes out to suit the moment, but the principles underlying the policy are never clear. I think we have established that matter pretty clearly in the course of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise many other matters but, to be fair to the other honourable members, time does not permit. In summary, the coalition welcomes the fact that this statement has been made. It provides an opportunity for some discussion on this crucial issue. We urge greater focus on basic health, education and other community level developments in our aid program. We have been concerned about some of the massive infrastructure projects, of which I spoke earlier. We have to be very careful about the way in which those things are handled. We need to be particularly cautious about the downstream economic benefits that might flow to the recipient country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We need to review the trade subsidy levels as a percentage of the aid budget. Those levels look high&mdash;although I understand the economic arguments. I think a great deal more thought needs to be given to that matter. We need to clarify and implement human rights principles in our aid program that are coherent and consistent. As I said earlier, we also need a comprehensive review of a development cooperation program in this country. It is well overdue now, as many years have past since the last independent review was carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need further debate in Australia about the nature of our aid, its direction and its underlying principles rather than just one question being asked of the amount of aid provided. Obviously, you cannot be trusted in relation to the amount of aid provided. It does not matter what you say before the next election because, in the unlikely event of your getting re-elected, what you actually do will be totally at variance with what you say. Forget making any promises on that front, because nobody will believe them. If you address some of those other issues, I think the aid program might start to come together a little more coherently. </PARA>

Following its referral by the House, the committee examined the bill, having particular regard to matters raised during the debate on the bill in the House on 8 February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee referred matters raised in debate in the House to the corporations law simplification task force and other interested bodies for their response. On Wednesday 22 February, the committee conducted a public hearing on the bill in Melbourne. The witnesses who appeared before the committee included representatives of accounting bodies, the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Finance Conference and the simplification task force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Tuesday 28 February, the committee held further discussions with the simplification task force and with Mr Leigh Hall, chair of the Corporations Law Simplification Consultative Group. The committee acknowledges the considerable effort of all those who have participated in the task force's consultative process and those who have provided the committee with submissions or who appeared before the committee at its public hearing. The committee notes that an extensive consultative process has been undertaken during the preparation and drafting of the bill. The bill has received general support from the investment, professional and user groups interested in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point of the committee's report is that, subject to specific matters mentioned in its report, the committee considers the bill should be passed by the parliament. Having said that, in relation to a number of concerns raised with or by the committee, where strong or different views were firmly held by individual members of the committee, the committee endeavoured to be of most assistance to the House by seeking to find as much common ground as possible and openly make on-balance judgments and leave some issues for consideration by the Attorney-General and debate in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deal in turn with some principal issues raised about the bill which the committee has examined in some detail. The first concern was whether the division of proprietary companies into small and large companies as proposed by the bill be adopted, or whether a reporting entity test proposed by the accounting bodies be adopted. The committee found this a difficult matter to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded on balance that the test proposed by the bill should be adopted, as the reporting entity test does not provide a test of sufficient certainty to allow an objective assessment to be made of whether a company falls within the reporting entity test when compared with the small-large distinction provided in the bill. Particularly in view of the Australian Securities Commission submission that the test in the bill provides a simple and objective test which, from a regulator's and a company's view point will not lead to any uncertainty about whether the requirement to lodge accounts applies, the committee concluded that the small-large test be supported over the reporting entity test. By way of aside, I should make the point that on this issue Senator McGauran has provided the House with a dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern was whether the criteria proposed in the bill for distinguishing between small and large proprietary companies be adopted in whole or in part. The test proposes that a company would move from a small to a large proprietary company when it had two out of the following three criteria: more than 50 employees, a gross operating revenue of more than $10 million, and assets of more than $5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplification task force indicated that the effect  of using a one out of three test would cause more companies than desirable to fall within the large company category. The practical effect of setting up a one out of three test would negate the intended effect of the scheme, namely, to reduce the unnecessary regulatory burden on small business. The task force also indicated that the effect of setting up a three out of three test would be to impose an unnecessarily restrictive test which would undesirably limit the number of large companies that would be obliged to prepare accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has found the resolution of questions about an appropriate test for defining a small or large proprietary company extremely difficult. The committee believes that, of the three criteria provided in the bill, the tests of assets and turnover are far and away the most important. The committee believes these two tests must be included in criteria for distinguishing small from large proprietary companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was much less convinced that a necessary test for distinguishing a small company was whether a company has more than 50 employees. The committee was unable to reach an unqualified view on the test, and believes that the Attorney-General should give serious consideration to two options, namely, that the 50 employees criterion should remain, or that the test of more than 50 employees be deleted from the bill and the test for a small-large proprietary company be on the proposed assets and turnover criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third concern was whether a register of debenture holders as provided in the bill should be public. The committee considered that convertible debentures should be treated in the same manner as shares and options and that the bill not be changed so far as it relates to convertible debentures. However, there seems to be insufficient reason to automatically treat other debentures in the same manner. The committee recommends that a register be kept of debentures, other than convertible debentures, but that access to the register should be subject to the same Australian Securities Commission power of exemption as at present, together with the privacy regime implemented by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of other issues were considered in some detail by the committee. One was the number of shareholders and directors in a proprietary company. In relation to the creation of single member proprietary company, as proposed by the bill, the committee has accepted that there should be  single member companies. This change will particularly do away with the perennial problem of two-person companies where a company has two directors, with one director an `active' director, and another director&mdash;often a spouse or partner&mdash;a `silent' director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The silent director has usually taken no actual role in the running of such companies. The situation which has arisen all too often is that a company fails, due to no fault of the silent director. The resulting financial problems for a silent director, who is usually jointly liable for the failed company's liabilities, is often referred to in the case of spouses as `sexually transmitted debt'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes the incorporation of a small business guide in the body of the Corporations Law. Some members of the committee had significant reservations about this method of drafting, believing, as a matter of principle, that material not forming part of the law should not be included in legislation. The committee believes the inclusion of the guide in the Corporations Law is an innovative measure, and considers that any risk it poses is outweighed by the benefits it promises. The committee has, however, recommended that inclusion of the guide in the act itself be subject to review by the Attorney-General after it has been in operation for a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to provisions governing the audit of accounts of proprietary companies, the committee would be concerned at any watering down of prescriptions as to who can audit the financial records of a registered company. The committee does not consider that the matters raised by the accounting bodies requires an amendment to the bill, but expects that the problem highlighted by the accounting bodies in their submission and evidence will be addressed by the audit and accounting working party set up under the simplification process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Law confers considerable discretion on the ASC in its power to require preparation of financial reports, and in many other areas. The ASC already publishes policy statements indicating the way in which it will administer the Corporations Law, practice notes for the guidance of practitioners on reporting and compliance matters, and class orders modifying the law in relation to classes or persons. However, the committee does not believe that a broad examination of the use by the ASC of its discretionary powers is appropriate in the context of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the ASC intends publishing its guidelines in respect of requiring small proprietary companies to prepare accounts, the committee considers that the bill should be passed in its present form in this respect. The committee, however, also believes that the ASC should prepare a quarterly report to the Attorney-General stating the reasons it has given in the relevant quarter for requiring small proprietary companies to prepare accounts, and that the report provided to the Attorney-General be tabled in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make some concluding comments about the simplification process itself. As part of its statutory duties to monitor the national scheme laws, the committee has monitored the establishment and progress of the simplification process and the consultative process which that has involved. The committee is conscious that, due to its extensive nature, the consultative process will occasionally give rise to provisions that do not meet the approval of all groups in the process. The inquiry has shown the committee a number of examples of such a situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the light of recent discussions with the task force and during the inquiry into this bill, the committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the task force's consultative process. Indeed, the committee is strongly of the view that the process followed by the task force is a great improvement on past practice and supports its continuation. The committee will continue to monitor the simplification and consultative process as part of its role of scrutiny of the administration and development of the national corporate law scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I came to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities as a newly appointed member after the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill had been introduced into the House. My initial concern, as I said at the time, was that one of the intended consequences of the bill could well have been that the Labor Party would have the opportunity of no longer filing accounts for its operative companies which deal with its money, finance its elections and deal with its property. I set those concerns out in my speech in the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came onto the committee and started to look at the bill in totality, I saw that there were some matters of quite considerable concern that needed to be investigated to a greater extent. The report as it is being presented today, recommending that the legislation be passed, has dealt with some of the concerns in a satisfactory way, but some remarks need to be made to indicate that there are ongoing concerns which may have to be dealt with in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the most contentious issue was the decision to introduce a new test for which proprietary companies should be required to lodge their accounts and returns with the Australian Securities Commission and which companies should not. This is not a novel proposition in that the situation already exists where companies are broken into those required to file and those not required to file. The old test was the exempt and non-exempt test&mdash;a complicated test. The simplification process should be commended, but there are some examples in the bill where, in an attempt to simplify, we are perhaps slipping into some shoddy practices. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) may address some of those in his remarks, as he made the point quite well during the committee hearing. There are one or two others as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To turn to the most contentious issue: the introduction of the new test of when you shall be required to file accounts and when you shall not be required to file accounts is now known as the small-large test. That means that, under the current bill, if you are a company and you meet two out of three criteria set down in the bill, you will be excused from filing your accounts. I asked: why were these three criteria chosen? What sort of evidence was presented to the consultative group or, indeed, to us as members of the committee that said that this is a good way to proceed? Or did somebody just wake up one day and say, `This looks like a good idea'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer seems to be that there was a paper prepared for the consultative group. In evidence the chairman of that group&mdash;and he spoke with the committee&mdash;said that there is such a test in operation in the United Kingdom and New Zealand and he thought in Canada but he could not remember. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon further inquiry it became apparent that the United Kingdom had the two out of three test, but New Zealand, which has more recently introduced a test for large and small, has a two out of two test. The chairman of the committee has already addressed the fact that we had a large number of submissions dealing with a different form of test altogether. But once the committee had decided that it was interested in recommending the large-small test, the question of what criteria should be met became a focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to say that what became apparent is that the system we are introducing has been lifted from the United Kingdom system. When I asked the following question of one of the members of the task force: `Was our system just like the United Kingdom system?', he said, `It's very close, but we had to make some adjustments on money.' I will go into that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to the New Zealand question, we had no evidence at all. We do not know why New Zealand chose two out of two instead of two out of three. We do not know whether or not the test in the United Kingdom works well or works badly. We saw no evidence. None was brought to the committee. On this very point, I feel that perhaps we should have been in a position to do a more thorough job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go to the three criteria that are listed in the bill. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proprietary company is a small proprietary company for a financial year if it satisfies at least 2 of the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the consolidated gross operating revenue for the financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is less than $10 million</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the value of the gross consolidated assets at the end of a financial year of the company and the entities it controls (if any) is less than $5 million</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)the company and the entities it controls (if any) have fewer than 50 employees at the end of the financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>If your company complies with two out of the three criteria, you are excused. That is the position in the United Kingdom. The New Zealanders have said that, if you have consolidated operating revenue for the financial year of a set sum of dollars, around $10 million, or if the value of your gross consolidated assets at the end of the year is less than a certain figure&mdash;we say $5 million; they have a figure of their own&mdash;then you are excused from filing. If it is greater than those two figures, you must file. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country, if you are a large company which has a gross operating revenue of $12 million a year&mdash;so you are above the test&mdash;and gross consolidated assets at the end of the financial year of $10 million, above the $5 million, and if in the month of May you have 60 employees on your books, you would be caught. You would have to file. But if you decided to fire 15 employees or of the 60 people you had working for you only 45 were employees, the rest were casual, contract labour or the like, you could drop one of the really substantive tests and say, `We have got fewer than 50 employees, so we are excused. We do not have to disclose what our returns are.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a test which militates against employment and against allowing sunshine onto the accounts and the affairs of corporations. When we said that we could not form an unqualified view, that is a perfectly accurate statement. It certainly was an unqualified view. We have asked that the Attorney-General look further into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fairness, it would be very sensible if the Attorney-General could take a very good look at the New Zealanders' experience and assess why they rejected the United Kingdom test which we have adopted and how well or how badly it works for them. There was some confusion even in the mind of the chairman of the consultative group. When I said, `If you meet three out of three, more people would be caught,' he expressed a contrary view. That was cleared up later. But the bottom line is that it remained a matter of some confusion as to why it was the right or the wrong decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of other things were quite important. There was an effort originally to show that the professions that were affected by this legislation were all gung-ho and in favour of it. That is not true either. The Law Council of Australia was split. The insolvency committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To suggest to people in business that certain advantages are available only while their companies remain "small" is short sighted and counter-productive.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the corporate committee of the Law Council of Australia thought it was a great test. So there is confusion in the ranks. The Institute of Chartered Accountants and the CPAs said they did not like the test and wanted another test. There is still a lot of debate out in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing it is important to say is that, whilst we are introducing simplified legislation, let us do what we say. We are moving to have legislation that says when Fred Smith, businessman, or Joanna Smith, businesswoman, picks up a piece of legislation, he or she can see what it really means. But, still, in the body of the drafting we have definitions by implication. We have a list that we have defined within the body of the legislation as to who can be a proprietary company, who is eligible to be subject to the large-small test and who is not. A public company cannot be a proprietary company; but we do not say what it is to be a public company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A note to me this morning from the corporations law simplification program said that there will be another bill coming in. I look forward to that. By implication, the bill defines what you have to be to be a proprietary company. If you do not fit that, you are a public company. But then there is an additional definition saying that a company which is limited by both shares and guarantee may not be a proprietary company. That is new, but it makes it clear. I think it would have been sensible to add that a company that is limited by guarantee alone is also a public company. Somebody who picks up the legislation could then clearly read it rather than having it implied from the new section 116 which, by implication, defines a public company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a good start and the work of the committee of this House is going to be more important as we proceed. One of the implicit difficulties with moving to plain English in an attempt to simplify the law is that you can create uncertainty instead of certainty. By moving away from certain set legal phrases which have defined meanings we could move to new phrases which have undefined meanings; and uncertainty can result. That is why I felt very sympathetic to Mr Tanner who has concerns about putting the small business guide into the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a beginning. I commend the idea of making law readily available to people because I have a fundamental problem with the concept that the law shall be the law by which we are bound but ordinary folk find it incomprehensible. For the same reason, I hope to goodness that one day we will move to some sensible simplification in the area of tax law. But at least in this area we have begun, with the requirement that the Australian Securities Commission will now flag its guidelines as to when it will require additional proprietary companies to file. We are starting to see some accountability return in that area as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I, too, applaud the work of the corporations law simplification task force and also the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in heading down this path to simplification of the Corporations Law. I will make a couple of comments on some of the matters raised by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). With respect to the absence of any reference in our report to the company being limited by guarantee, we have a difference about that. In my view the position is perfectly clear elsewhere in the legislation, in section 116, which she referred to. It was unnecessary for us to make reference to that. This issue, to the extent that it will be dealt with in any way by simplification processes, will be dealt with in a subsequent bill. It should be noted that this is the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994 and deals only with certain sections of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to refer to the question of the so-called small-large test and, in particular, the limb with respect to 50 employees. I disagree with the suggestion of the member for Mackellar that that militates against employment. I think it is beyond comprehension that any company will be so motivated to avoid the need to report or to file returns that it would dismiss employees or go through all sorts of convoluted arrangements in order to bring itself below the 50 employees. I do not agree with that concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is fair to say, as the committee reported, that this particular limb of the test is clearly of lesser importance than the other two limbs. That is, in my view, primarily because it is actually less certain when you consider factors like having full-time and casual employees who may work only every now and then&mdash;every few weeks or every few months. Clearly, it is less certain than the other tests with respect to assets and turnover. For that reason, the committee has reported that the Attorney-General should give consideration to the merits of this particular limb of the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the broader point that does prevail on this issue is: where do you draw the line? At one end of the spectrum, we have large proprietary companies that should be filing accounts and reporting. That is obviously in the community's interest. At the other end of the spectrum, we have very small companies for which filing accounts and reporting is an onerous obligation and one that really does not serve any great community or public purpose, but puts the people who are running those companies into expense and difficulty. What we are seeking to do here is to meet two ultimately competing imperatives, and in the middle there are companies in a borderline situation where it would be difficult to have an obvious answer as to whether or not they should report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trick is to develop a test that is certain. The reason that we ultimately supported the simplification task force's test, rather than the so-called reporting entity test as proposed by the chartered accountants, was the greater certainty of the simplification task force's proposed test. A test should also have companies falling on the right side of the line, depending on whether it is in the public interest that they report or not report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ironic thing about the view expressed by the honourable member for Mackellar is that&mdash;given that she has, in the past, put herself forward as a strong defender of the rights of small business&mdash;if it were actually enacted, it would lead to at least some small businesses who, under the task force's regime, would not have to report actually being included and having to report. They would then be faced with the problem of additional expense, paperwork and a bigger bureaucracy. The intention of this legislation is to relieve that burden. Although I do not question the motives of the honourable member for Mackellar, I think an unfortunate consequence of her position&mdash;or one that may well be&mdash;is that people in small business are actually exposed to a greater obligation of unnecessary, at least in some instances, reporting and providing accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final comment I make is with respect to a matter that the honourable member for Mackellar gave me glowing praise for, which, no doubt, I will find difficult to live down&mdash;that is, the issue of the small business guide and its inclusion within the legislation. It is fair to say that this is something of an unusual or innovative step in that a document which purports to be advice about the content of legislation and about what it means&mdash;a user's guide&mdash;is actually being incorporated as part of the act of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first blush that offended my notion of what an act of parliament is about. In my view, it is there to create obligations, rights and laws that apply to all of the community; it is not to advise the community about what the law actually is. There are some inherent dangers in that with respect to both judicial interpretation of the law and the rights and obligations of professionals who are advising users of the law. A blurring of the distinction between an act of parliament and advice about an act of parliament is a worry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the spirit of cooperation, I have been prepared to give this the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, I feel that the committee's recommendation that the Attorney-General review the operation of this section of the legislation, at a subsequent point, is worth while. I would like to place on record that, if this type of approach to the process of legislation is to spread to other areas, I may not be quite so generous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;First, I would like to re-emphasise a point that has been made by a number of speakers. Simplification of laws should not make law unintelligible or difficult to identify. It worries me that we have identified in this advisory report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill the share buyback provisions, for example, more on the number of words than on the degree to which they are understandable. Not only is simplification something that is needed but also it is a matter of consolidating the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have long been concerned that, as in this instance, we are adding another bill to the heap instead of consolidating the law and making the law understandable by reference to one bill alone. I would hope that, at the end of this review process, one piece of legislation is introduced which incorporates all the amendments, thereby making it a lot easier for those who need to turn to the law to know what the law is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would also like to compliment the members of the Corporations Law Simplification Consultative Group, particularly Mr Leigh Hall, and the members of the simplification task force. It is essential that, if law is to be changed, those who are practitioners in the field are consulted so that it is not just a matter of modification within the Public Service in Canberra. In that sense the reference to the committee was valuable, although it is very difficult with the sort of inquiry that we made to take account of the views of those who operate proprietary companies, as they are now formed in the exempt category, and to be sure that the new requirements meet the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some respects I am still unhappy with the version we have reached on the definitions of `small' and `large'. Earlier speakers have made some reference to the three criteria. I am one of those who believe that the number of employees really should be excluded because I cannot see how it adds to the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand has moved far further than Australia in modification of their corporations law. It seems to have learned from the American practice rather than relying peculiarly on our British heritage. I am interested to see that the present Australian government, which seeks to set aside its British connection in so many respects, prefers it in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, I would have preferred to follow the New Zealand practice and thereby have only two obligatory criteria. The criteria are the gross operating revenue and the assets of the company, and the number of employees should be excluded. In the report itself we have left the conclusion on that point a little ambivalent. For my part, I am not at all ambivalent; I think it would be far better if we excluded that criterion relating to the number of employees and maintained the requirement that all companies who exceed the gross operating revenue and the assets test figures that are set in the bill to file their accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other aspects of the bill which I want to address. The first one that is mentioned in the report is the number of directors. I am concerned that the conclusion has been reached that only one director will be sufficient for a proprietary company under this new category of a small company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the recommendations of the insolvency committee of the Law Council of Australia, which suggested there was still an advantage in retaining two directors, should have been followed. In part, this is because I have always felt that it is necessary to distinguish a company from an individual and, to the degree to which you make a company identical, I think there is a disadvantage. For all that we refer to sexually transmitted debt in the text of the report, it is my view that having two directors places a greater obligation on an individual running a corporation. I think it would have been preferable to have taken the view of the insolvency committee of the Law Council in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of aspects of auditing and accounting standards have been mentioned briefly. However, there is another inquiry now being conducted by the task force and the consultative group into those aspects. I look forward to the bill that will return in due course for us to consider whether or not those aspects should be included. I hope that we will be able to look at that report through the same committee structure. There are a number of aspects of accounting standards and audit requirements which I think could well be included in the legislation, and I hope they shall be in the future, once again, to make the legislation a little more understandable by both members of the accounting profession and their clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two matters in the report to which I referred were, first, there is a capacity within the ASC to require that accounts should be tabled even though the company might be excluded by the criteria prescribed. The committee has concluded that it would be advisable for the ASC to table reasons, through the minister, by reporting on three-monthly intervals the reasons for those requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to see that the ASC intends to publish the reporting requirements and, generally, the ways in which it intends to administer the changes to the legislation. But it would be helpful if there were to be tabled by the minister on three-monthly intervals the practice intended to be followed by the ASC&mdash;and there is reference to that in paragraphs 283 and 284 of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that I wanted briefly to refer to, as I understand the matter is not to be debated in the Senate, is the fact that my colleague Senator Julian McGauran has filed a dissenting report. There was considerable debate in the committee about the reporting entity test which was favoured by the Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and by others who gave evidence to the committee. Mr Leigh Hall, the chairman of the consultative group, suggested that he at one stage had also been in favour of that reporting entity test to distinguish between small and large companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view is that it becomes too confusing, and it was on that basis that I accepted the alternative. While I wanted to mention that dissenting report, the majority of the committee certainly felt that the reporting entity test was too confusing and, therefore, should not have been followed. At the same time, I repeat my assertion that the legislation would have been far better if only two of the three requirements now included in the present bill before the House were required. They are that the asset and turnover tests should be appropriate, as in New Zealand, instead of providing the opportunity for the number of employees also to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we simplify legislation. At the same time, when there are changes as fundamental as these and when concerns have been expressed, as they have been, I would hope that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) does not feel that the legislation is necessarily written in stone. It is legislation that needs to be reconsidered from time to time. I hope that when the subsequent reports from the consultative group are before this chamber, we might have an opportunity to perhaps review some of the matters and their practice in the report that is now being adopted into the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and that, ultimately, we might have a consolidated piece of legislation which would be of far more use to the practising public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I commend the people who have taken part in the report from the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. When the NCSC bill was introduced, it ran for three days with two speakers; when the ASC bill was introduced by Lionel Bowen, it went for four days with two speakers; and the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill has gone for half an hour with four speakers. The knowledge and interest in company law is quite astonishing&mdash;it must be one of the few growth industries left.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along the lines of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I purely want to add my caution to some of the developments that have come out of the report. Simplification is a very desirable path. Those who work in company law or in taxation law will know that in the last few years it has become an absolute nightmare to try to get to some concrete decisions and finally know where you stand. It is even more so in tax and company law. These movements are in the right direction and are full of good intent but, like all matters of good intent, they are paved with a lot of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with small business is management. The failure of small business in the main, while it is always blamed on something else, in very large measure is a question of management. The best tool of management is proper accounts, and proper accounts will be kept only if there is a compulsory requirement to report on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal here brings forward the concept of one director. That is a very fine concept. But a lot of people in business would ask, `Why do you need this?' In terms of accountability and responsibility, in recent times there has been a lot of talk about wayward creditors. We have heard about the big ones in the newspapers, but there are thousands of small ones who walk away from bankruptcy petitions under circumstances of loose accounts, no accounts at all or with pure cash situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore I would like the committee to take into consideration the creditors' and debtors' positions&mdash;it is not only the income tax commissioner's particular problem&mdash;as they relate to ordinary commerce and the desirability of going to one director rather than having two. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) referred to some matters earlier. I think she would have drawn attention to the case of a proprietary company involved in a family law action where, if it is run by one company director and a residual partner, there would be no access to those accounts so they would not necessarily know what was going on. Therefore in a normal family business it would be prudent, I would have thought, to look to those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the question of audit, when the committee refers this to the expert committee involved I hope that genuine consideration will be given to finding a way to ensure that proper accounts are kept, even on the say-so of the auditor who could state that he has lodged a taxation return based on the corporate accounts. This may be beneficial towards keeping some form of management tool alive and well in small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not had an opportunity to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of yesterday's debate on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 1995, but I suspect we will find an interesting coalescence of points of view from all sides of the House and some strange bedfellows in the debate. But that is all to the good, and I am sure that the majority of people in the House will definitely support the government's record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment bill is aimed to clarify the scope of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992, and is part of a positive program by the government. We have a very proud record on legislation in this area; in fact, the World Health Organisation sees us as a world leader on this matter. An article by Adrian Bradley in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 31 May 1994 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nation's anti-tobacco legislation remains at the forefront of international moves to ban cigarette advertising, providing the World Health Organisation with a blueprint for moves to persuade Western Pacific countries to introduce similar measures.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is this important? It is important because the World Health Organisation estimates that three million people die each year from smoking related illnesses and it expects this to increase to 10 million a year by the year 2020. In Australia about 3.5 million Australians smoke, representing 28 per cent of people over the age of 18 years. This is falling, with 32 per cent of men and 24.7 per cent of women smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that change has been the move away from the availability of advertising. I suspect that, like me, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott will remember the Peter Stuyvesant advertisements&mdash;London, Paris, New York&mdash;at the Saturday afternoon flicks, which is where we used to go in the world before television. Mr Deputy Speaker may not remember that; he may be too young. But, in those days, overseas travel and all the sophistication that involved was a great model for those of us who aspired to that. Part and parcel of that was cigarette smoking. We have seen a major change due to government policy and a rearguard action from some of the national cigarette companies, culminating in a High Court challenge to some of our legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw to the attention of the House the need for members in this place to observe the very proper and appropriate rulings of the Speaker and the President in relation to smoking in the precincts of the parliament. There are rules that all employees of the parliament must adhere to, and it concerns me greatly that certain members in this place feel that it is quite appropriate for them to inflict passive smoking on the rest of us. I urge all of my colleagues to walk outside if they must smoke. We will try to get away from that cigarette smoke in the garden areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that all adults act as effective role models. As we curtail opportunities to promote cigarette messages, one of the important issues we have to address is young people taking up smoking. In her article by the Drug Education Journal of Australia entitled `Peter Jackson, you're lying: education or advertising&mdash;which message is more convincing?' Margaret Powell outlines the importance of the communicated message. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our consumer-oriented society, there is another force operating in children's lives. Independence and adulthood are seen to be manifested through appealing images which are used skilfully by advertising agencies to sell products, to sell cigarettes. Despite the wide public acceptance of detrimental effects of smoking among children and their peers, smoking cigarettes is seen to respect independence, maturity, vitality, popularity and success.</PARA>
<PARA>We find that young people, particularly those in puberty and perhaps even from grade 7, see smoking as an important rite of passage. This is something we have to address not only by removing those public images but also by sending very positive anti-smoking messages and providing children with assertiveness training. It is absolutely essential that cigarette manufacturers not be allowed to sponsor sport or cultural activities. I believe that, as we have continued to curtail this activity, other companies have taken up the slack and are now sponsoring major sporting events. I believe that, when cigarette manufacturers are banned from sponsoring sporting events, the current consumer acquiescence to sponsorship of sport will also change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue we have to address is the way cigarette companies are using value adding programs to entice young people to smoke. It is certainly something we will have to address because, often, the people targeted are those who are most likely to be affected by smoking. For instance, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 3 February 1995, a reference is made to a Senate submission in relation to a Northern Territory individual. The article mentions a promotion being offered to stores in Top End Aboriginal communities. The promotion involves a free T-shirt with the community name on the back and a `big country' and `Malboro' advertising slogan on the front. All these initiatives are encouraging young people to smoke and are trying to get around our advertising bans. I look forward to continuing my comments after question time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Last August when the current account deficit grew to $1.8 billion for the month, you dismissed it by saying `It is after all only one month's figures' and that what we were `seeing this time is a limitation in the rise'&mdash;I repeat, a limitation in the rise&mdash;in the current account deficit. Given that since then the current account deficit has risen to the highest monthly and three-monthly levels ever recorded, and given that six of the last seven monthly results have been above $2 billion, do you seriously still suggest that we are seeing a limitation in the rise, to use your own words?

I think that quoting some number after the Treasurer has actually given a considered view by the Treasury forecasters and has made it public in the mid-year review answers the point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But we need them to add to our capital stock to be able to produce more goods and services. Also in that month exports were up four per cent and imports were down three. While growth in exports has slowed in recent months, manufacturing exports have performed particularly well. An interesting number here is that, for the year to the September quarter, exports of elaborately transformed goods were up 19 per cent. How different it is that manufactured and elaborately transformed exports have been growing so strongly&mdash;and again in this month by over 19 per cent&mdash;compared with the old decaying industrial archaeology that this government inherited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But an even more important point is our ability to fund the deficit. Akin to this question is a mortgage and one's capacity to pay and meet the mortgage obligations. What are they here? We have a strong capital goods base, which is growing. We are making inroads into new markets with manufacturing and production. Our debt servicing ratio&mdash;that is, the proportion of our exports which is going to servicing our debt&mdash;has fallen from just on 21 per cent in the late 1980s to 11 per cent today at last count. That is, the proportion of the country's exports which are actually committed to servicing our debt has fallen by over half since the late 1980s&mdash;that is, from 21 per cent to 11 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other underlying strong point is that we are now 40 per cent more competitive than a decade ago. If you add up that continuing competitiveness&mdash;that is, the low inflation and the high productivity, the very large real depreciation of the exchange rate over the last six or eight years, the growth in manufacturing and manufactured exports, the growth in exports as a proportion of GDP from 14 to 21 per cent and the decline in the debt service component from 21 to 11 per cent&mdash;you can see that they are unambiguously bald points about Australia's capacity to service its debt.</PARA>

I believe that if it came to the key question of whether the government would say to Australian business, `You shall not invest abroad because we don't want any covering of that investment on the current account,' the answer to that is that the government has made the right decision and removed exchange controls and let that happen. Compare that, Mr Speaker, with the cloistered, closeted, frightened little economy that John Howard left them; all locked up with their market share up to optimums.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Paterson, I can say that I am aware of some statements made yesterday by the Shadow Treasurer. When speaking on ABC radio about the housing sector he said, `And basically it has been closed down in terms of activity.' What he was talking about was the release of the January approvals figures which showed a decline of some 9.7 per cent seasonally adjusted in that month. What we see with those figures is that there is quite a bit of fluctuation month by month, even though they are seasonally adjusted, and that particularly comes about because of the fact that we have included in them not just houses but also medium density dwelling units in Sydney and Melbourne in particular, but also in most capital cities.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Approvals for those housing units have been strongly increasing. Of course, they happen in a lumpy way. When they come in, they push the units up for that month. When they are not there, there is a big drop. If we look at South Australia, in the month of January there was a 35 per cent increase in private dwelling approvals because of the approval of one large medium-density project in the city of Adelaide. So I think that shows you about the monthly variability, Mr Speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is also important to note that if we look at the figures for private sector housing&mdash;not medium-density units but ordinary housing&mdash;approvals for ordinary housing fell by half a per cent. Of course, that is a much different picture. In fact, looking at that picture, Mr Silberberg, of the Housing Industry Association&mdash;who is not known normally for his support of the government in any way&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The small fall in the more interest rate sensitive private house approvals suggests home buyers may be coming to grips with higher interest rates, and reduces earlier concerns of a free fall in housing activity.</PARA>
<PARA>So the industry is saying, `Well, these figures actually give us some comfort,' whilst the shadow Treasurer, in normal ultra beat-up mode, is saying that the industry is being closed down by what is happening in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, that is obviously an absurd overstatement, to put it at the least. In fact, one has to have some regard, in looking at the downturn in housing which has certainly occurred in recent times, to the levels at which it has been. Of course, it has been at record levels. The housing industry has been doing better, until recent times, than it has ever done in the history of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this upturn we have built 480,000 additional dwelling units. That is more than in any other upturn in Australia's history. So, since the economy got on the upswing again, from 1991 to 1994, 480,000 dwelling units have been built, more than any previous recovery. It is housing that essentially led the economy back onto a growth path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot, of course, expect the industry to keep on belting away with substantial increases in activity year by year, particularly when it has generally been seen as running ahead of the underlying level of demand given by the rate of formation of family units in this country. Therefore, at some stage, it had to slow, and that is what we have been witnessing in recent times, albeit assisted by some increases in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, let us get it clearly understood that 1994 was an enormously good year for housing. Total approvals were 189,000 units, the highest level on record&mdash;absolutely the highest level on record. The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry is saying that for this financial year, 1994-95, it will be 160,000. So there is some downturn&mdash;we are seeing that in the figures for approvals and commencements&mdash;but that is a downturn from exceedingly high levels of activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the level of approvals in January, at 13,200, is still above the average for the last 10 years. So we are still at above average levels of activity, going back for a decade, in approvals, and with commencements we see a similar sort of picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, it is just the most ridiculous statement&mdash;typical of the opposition's attitude of massive doomsaying about the Australian economy to the point where there is just no credibility in anything that it says&mdash;for the shadow Treasurer to say that the industry had been basically closed down. All that is happening is that it is tailoring off from the highest levels of activity that have occurred in the history of this country to levels which are still well above average compared with those of the last decade or so.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make these points about the comparison between the government and the opposition. The Howard-Reith policy removes as a minimum, at least, overtime and annual leave loadings. We know this because the member for Flinders told us on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> recently, `Jobsback is the thrust of coalition policy'. He also said this in a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry last week. He said, `Our jobsback policy remains intact.' Let us get this on the record. `Our jobsback policy,' he said `remains intact.' So nothing has changed except the camouflage. So the opposition refused to acknowledge that the area of great exposure to Australian workers is the turnover in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the year ending February 1994, for example, 1.6 million people changed jobs or employers&mdash;that is in a labour market of eight million. That is 20 per cent of the labour force in one year&mdash;130,000 new positions a month or 4,000 a day. In other words, that constant change in the labour market would mean that those people who line up to protect their minimums or to maintain, for instance, their annual leave loading or their overtime, would find that they were unable to secure it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example. A new typical part-time nurse working 20 hours each weekend would have her pay lowered by $114.80 per weekend.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the minister confirm that workers on awards will continue to receive safety net wage increases? Is it the intention of the government not to update award wages of pay for workers who cannot benefit from enterprise bargaining?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1462" SPEAKER="Brereton The Hon L.J." NAMEID="5T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSFORD-SMITH" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the cornerstones of the Industrial Relations Reform Act is the maintenance and the strengthening of the award safety net. The act requires the commission to ensure that the award system provides a secure, relevant and consistent minimum set of wages and conditions. Of course, it is backed up by accord mark 7, which has provided safety net adjustments for low paid workers in each of the last three years&mdash;the last being the current $8 adjustment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast with this, the coalition's industrial relations policy contains no safety net&mdash;none whatsoever&mdash;other than four miserly conditions that are set out in Jobsback. Earlier today in question time, the Prime Minister illustrated what would happen to people looking for a job under the Liberal's Jobsback.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth asking the question: what will happen to the 45 per cent of workers who remain in their jobs for five years or more? For those people who choose to remain on their award, assuming that they are allowed to, of course, under Jobsback, the future is bleak indeed. That is because Jobsback has absolutely no mechanism to update the award. Awards will, under Jobsback, be frozen in time. The member for Bennelong said on Melbourne radio on 12 February 1993 in response to a caller who asked him, if she stayed on her award, would she be stuck on the same wage indefinitely:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, I don't disguise the fact that under our policy, if you disagree, you are guaranteed your current award conditions and the question of whether you get any improvement on those becomes a matter of negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA>He then conceded on that program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lady's question is correctly based.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. It is worth looking at one of the many examples of what could happen to a worker under Jobsback. Take the case of a textile worker in a factory and on an award rate of $349.40 per week. That textile worker, under a coalition government, if you assume that inflation was running at 3 per cent&mdash;I believe that is pretty generous to the opposition, because the last time the member for Bennelong held the fiscal reins inflation was running at 11.4 per cent&mdash;would see his or her award eroded over a three-year period, in real terms, by $31.40&mdash;a decrease of 8.3 per cent for that worker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pity the family of that textile worker. So much for the opposition's commitment to families. Think about the family of that textile worker. Make no mistake, Jobsback is still the policy of the coalition. As recently as 18 April 1994, the member for Bennelong said on radio station 2GB:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jobsback is not gone. Jobsback remains the policy of the coalition. There is absolutely no suggestion that Jobsback has gone. Jobsback was not part of Fightback.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that has been borne out by none other than the member for Flinders&mdash;Mr GST himself&mdash;on the recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program. Mr Speaker, have no doubt: Australian workers will have little difficulty in remembering that Jobsback is pure code for reducing pay and conditions.</PARA>

We all know, don't we&mdash;like you were honest in the 1970s, wandering through while the tax commissioner wrote you all those letters&mdash;the telephone book&mdash;`Please, Treasurer, help us beat the criminal avoidance of tax industry'. There were pleas from a public servant to an uncaring, unlistening, smug, slick Treasurer. We know how honest you were then. We know that's how you got the ironic title of honest John.

I think it is fair to say that his views are particularly relevant because he is one of the world's leading experts on aviation safety. In 1992 he carried out a review of the Australian air traffic services system. That review included a number of criticisms of the way the Civil Aviation Authority was then operating Sydney airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, Dr Ratner endorsed the way the CAA is operating Sydney airport and warned against the reopening of the east-west runway. He did so on the grounds that reopening the runway would cut safety margins by reintroducing simultaneous operations on crossing runways&mdash;that is, the SIMOPS system&mdash;for a doubtful gain in capacity. He was quite adamant in his support of the current operations. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any way you strike it in terms of throughput or in terms of safety, the parallel runway operation is the way to go.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Dr Ratner had to say. Of course, those views totally go against those of that other self-appointed air space management expert, the Leader of the Opposition, whose announced policy is to reopen the east-west runway. To be fair, Dr Ratner acknowledges that SIMOPS is employed at a number of airports around the world and that it was employed at Kingsford Smith airport until recently. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, he says that SIMOPS operates at those airports which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . are willing to take on a requirement for a much higher degree of vigilance&mdash;and the possibility of incidents and . . . accidents&mdash;in order to move the traffic.</PARA>
<PARA>That is his view. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When you can avoid it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, SIMOPS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You've made another step up the safety ladder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been able to do that with the . . . third runway, let's not go back.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Ratner yesterday referred to an incident in 1991, when SIMOPS almost led to a disaster at Sydney airport. That incident involved a Thai Airways DC10, carrying 167 passengers; an Ansett A320, carrying 101 passengers; and a Qantas B747, which had 353 passengers on board. All up, that is 621 people. As the BASI investigation&mdash;which was the official investigation of that incident&mdash;reports, those 621 people were 11 metres from disaster. You can see the depiction of the cross-runway configuration on the BASI official report, which was available from 12 August 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet now opposition members are happy to reject the overwhelming expert advice, and they propose the reintroduction of a mode of airport operations in our largest airport&mdash;the airport that services our largest city&mdash;which is less safe than the present mode of operations.

Here he is, trying to ask the Prime Minister of the day whether I condone a polling technique&mdash;which his party first used in 1988&mdash;when he knew that the technique employed had nothing whatsoever to do with that dishonourable, disreputable technique.

You are allowed to talk about 1929; you are allowed to talk about 1946; but, for God's sake, don't mention the war. Whatever you do, don't mention the war. Also, `Do not for one minute mention how I got my name honest John.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was a lucky politician in Australia it has to be the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), because the population in general would now believe that the nickname honest John came from a reputation for public integrity during the time he was a minister. In fact, the nickname honest John was coined at one decisive point: it was coined in 1978 after the 1978 budget in which the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the most extreme in terms of its presentation, and with the rest of the Australian provincial dailies all with the same theme&mdash;carried on the front page the words `lies, lies, lies' in huge bold type. They carried those words `lies, lies, lies' because John Howard had brought down a budget and in that budget was a direct repudiation of all the election promises he had put forward in 1977. So, from that day on until quite recently, honest was accompanied by quotation marks. That is where the title came from. This is a useful opportunity for us to provide the House with a reminder of that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, in these censure debates the Liberals actually have the courage to stay in the chamber but they have all gone. They went straight out the door, except the poor chap at the table, the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who has to sit here and carry the can for his leader because somebody has to sit on the opposition front bench. The member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), who has covered himself in glory in recent days by his efforts inside the Liberal Party to deal with the issue of push polling, is also sitting here and half of the Independents are sitting here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The others have retreated to lick their wounds because this is a censure debate that they invited upon themselves. We did not start off with the intention of censuring them for this; we merely started off with the intention of pointing out a few facts. But members of the opposition said, `Oh, please, get up and censure us' and so we did. We are obliging fellows and so we got up and censured them. When we did, there was not a single word of reply from the opposition leader to the gravamen of the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I show to the House the how-to-vote card. I will go through it again because I think it is necessary to debate the point of the censure and argue the toss as to what that point means. If you have got evidentiary documents associated with it, then you might as well table them and go through it. Any person receiving this piece of paper could in no way be misled about where it came from because it has the Australian Labor Party logo sitting there. It has written across the bottom of the page, `Authorised by Doug Thompson, Australian Labor Party'. It does not carry on top of it a No. 1 preference because it is handed out in the assumption that the person receiving it is going to vote Independent No. 1. It simply carries on down the list from that point onwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not a bogus how-to-vote card in itself. A bogus how-to-vote card, indeed, might have carried the number `1' upon it. The opposition failed to point out that this was taken up with the Electoral Commissioner for the ACT who, at the end of the day, approved it. I wonder, however, whether he approved this little document from the same election. This little document says:</PARA>

It also put out bogus how-to-vote cards with no clarity at all about the origins of those how-to-vote cards. One great thing in politics that you learn very early on is projection: when somebody comes at you, there is a 90 per cent chance that he is coming at you with a problem for himself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have here an interesting report from today's newspaper the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. It says `Top Liberal candidates miss out'. There was an awful lot talked about by the Leader of the Opposition in his 12-minute readings from past literature and his three-minute defence of himself, and that was about people who get ballots and do not actually win elections. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal candidate for the Canberra by-election did not top the poll of party members for the preselection, according to party informants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others say the leading candidates who lost, on the Left and the Centre of the party, were subjected to a right-wing disinformation campaign that fitted the pattern, if not the depths, of the push-polling campaign against Labor's candidate, Sue Robinson.</PARA>
<PARA>If you go on and read the rest of this very sorry little report, you will find the statement by the Liberals, `We don't really care what Liberal Party members feel in this area. There is a little closed purple circle and we will hear the opinion of the members but we will appoint whom we like at the end of the day. We'll put them through a poll. It doesn't matter what votes they get in that poll, rorted or otherwise, we are going to select exactly whom we desire. And our own party members that we would otherwise have thought in good standing, we will subject them to the sort of campaign that Sue Robinson has been subject to in this situation.' The Liberal Party is very fast off the mark in accusations over here on the subject of honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the issue in this parliament yesterday, in, I thought, a fairly light-hearted sort of way, because I do not really want to see Andrew Robb in gaol for six months; nor do I want to see him fined $2,500. I have lower ambitions. I merely wish his leader to repudiate him. That is all. I do not want to see him in gaol. I do not want to see him in any way, shape or form fined. But I would not mind seeing his leader give him a bit of repudiation every now and then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did we find? I mentioned it in a fairly unheavy fashion because I did not know whether the Liberal Party had cleared with the Western Australian lottery commission the particular raffle book that it sent to George Gear's family. I could not have told from that document&mdash;unlike this document which the Liberals could tell was a Labor Party circulated document&mdash;whether it had been cleared with the Western Australian gaming commission because it contained only reference to Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory licences. So I left it hanging as to whether anything untoward had happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened? The old push pollers of the Liberal Party&mdash;they are no longer spin doctors&mdash;including the leader, were up around the gallery saying, `Beazley's overstepped himself.

But one of the journalists, Lenore Taylor, actually had the presence of mind to ring the Western Australian gaming commission.

<PARA>As I said before, I do not particularly want any action to be taken on the matter. But I am quite enjoying the fact that the Liberals' spin doctoring has been revealed for the tissue of lies that it is, as is the case with most of their other activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do take exception to the sorts of things that Sue Robinson has been subjected to in Canberra. I take very grave exception to those. As pointed out by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition has not repudiated those. The reason we have the censure motion in this place is the pathetic effort by the Leader of the Opposition to mislead this House, in coming forward with a ticket, properly marked by the Labor Party, and alleging that there was something wrong with it&mdash;when in fact it had been cleared. The reason he has done that is that he wants to crawfish out of the consequences of his failing to repudiate the people on his staff and the people in the federal office for the various shenanigans that they have got up to, including that most heinous of shenanigans associated with push polling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that so far there have been three or four editorials on this matter. It has been considered of sufficient weight, dealing with the integrity and honesty in the Australian electoral system. It has not been brushed off by them as a slight matter of no moment. There have been editorials by three or four of our major daily papers saying that this form of activity, this form of defamation, this suggesting that a particular candidate has written books inviting people to go and burn down the houses of the burghers of Canberra&mdash;which is what was suggested by the Liberals&mdash;and that the candidate endorsed a proposition that people should be entitled to legal terminations of pregnancy at nine months, and a whole plethora of slanderous lies that were incorporated in that push polling technique, should be banned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those newspapers had the opportunity, and have taken it, to repudiate this activity. The only person who still thinks it is a pretty good idea&mdash;or, if he does not think it is a good idea, he has taken the view that he will just let it flick past and if the old boss cocky of the Liberal Party decides to pursue it at some point in time he will let that pass too&mdash;has been honest John, trying to cover himself with a piece of work that is purely contemptible, but a piece of work which stands in such dramatic contrast with the Liberals' behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, in the course of political campaigns in which there is a plethora of political parties, political parties will try to take advantage of that situation. But here the Labor Party presents an honest statement. The Labor Party says, `Put the Liberals last. Authorised by Doug Thompson, Australian Labor Party. If you vote Independent and you want your preference to go to the ALP, this is how you do it.' The Labor Party tells people what it is doing but the `Ratepayers revolt' put things out with no Liberal Party identification. There is no indication whatsoever where they come from. If you are in the independent minded ratepayers revolt group, just rock on out there and vote Liberal. That is the proposition put forward by the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition invited his personal censure. He gave us no reason why he should not be censured.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Labor Party opposite never learns and it never changes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This censure motion today is to complain that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) misled the House with his allegations about how-to-vote arrangements in the ACT. These were not allegations; these were facts. The basis of the facts is none other than the documentation, which was circulated to ALP branch workers at the ACT elections and which I hold in my hand. The evidence contained in these documents shows beyond all reasonable doubt that the claims made by the opposition are absolutely correct. The important thing is that neither the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) nor the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) makes any serious attempt to explain the unexplainable. Why is it so? It is because in the ACT election we merely saw a continuation of a long line of cheating, cajolery and activities of this dubious nature that you and your party in virtually every state of Australia&mdash;whether it be Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria&mdash;have perpetrated for far too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me start with Queensland. There was a by-election in the seat of Mirani. There was a Confederate Action Party candidate. This particular candidate claimed to give his second preferences to the National Party. But was the Labor Party to be outdone on this? Was there any risk to be taken? Of course not. The Labor Party put out its own how-to-vote card, which said, `Make your voice heard in the government by voting for the Confederate Action Party,' but then it said&mdash;we are told this is the Labor Party technique&mdash;`Don't support Borbidge's bickering coalition. Give your second preference to your Wayne Goss Labor candidate Graeme Hall and do not waste your vote.' Any reasonable person reading that document would say that it had been put out by the Confederate Action Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now move to what happened in Victoria. The general secretary, Peter Bachelor, issued a bogus how-to-vote card in the Nunawading by-election in the 1980s. Labor denied it but, eventually, you admitted your fault. You admitted that you were cheating. There is two out of two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I will move to the ACT, which is the subject of this particular debate. I suggest that in this particular case one can only conclude that the motive was deception. It was deception in its most vile form. For the benefit of those members opposite who may not want to believe what some of their colleagues get up to when they get the opportunity, this is what a preference how-to-vote card looks like a la ALP. Booth captains at the ACT election were told that booths that have preference how-to-vote cards will not have ALP identifiable badges, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a reasonable man. I am sure all my colleagues here are reasonable people. When they are facing a situation like that, they have to turn to that fundamental word `motive'. If the motive of the Labor Party booth captains was to encourage their booth workers to deliberately disseminate information which they knew to be inaccurate, it is deception. There is no other way to describe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, this document states, `We want to distinguish between those giving out ALP how-to-votes and those giving out preference how-to-votes.' The key word is `distinguish'. What was the Labor Party trying to distinguish? Was it trying to distinguish Liberal votes from Labor votes? Was it trying to distinguish Independent votes from Labor votes, or Independent votes from Liberal votes? You do not have to be more than a halfwit to work out that the Labor Party in Canberra and its booth workers knew precisely what they were trying to distinguish, because they have told us. They were trying to distinguish between those giving out ALP how-to-votes and those giving out preference how-to-votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why were they trying to do that? They were doing that with a deliberate intention to deceive the electors of Canberra and to make them believe they were voting independent. There it is. They are not my words; it is your document. They are not my thoughts, your intentions. They are not my desires, your deceit. There is no doubt about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next document has instructions for handing out preference how-to-vote cards&mdash;euphemistically and very appropriately called green slips. The first instruction is: the person handing out the preference how-to-votes should attempt to get the last position in the queue&mdash;that is, the position closest to the polling booth&mdash;not forgetting that there is a minimum distance of six metres. It was very generous of them to tell us that. Why were they doing that? They were positioning their people deliberately so that, as the electors went into the booth, the last piece of paper they would receive would be this dubious piece of bumf&mdash;this dubious piece of paper&mdash;telling them that if they voted Independent not to give the Liberal/Alliance&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>That is the matter on which I claim to have been misrepresented. It misrepresents the truth in many respects. The facts are: firstly, Fred Many was convicted in 1986 of a brutal rape which left his victim near to death. He got 20 years gaol under the sexual assault legislation for which I was responsible. I was the Attorney-General that passed that legislation. He subsequently appealed that sentence, and the Court of Criminal Appeal in New South Wales reduced the sentence to 12 years 10 months taking into consideration his activities as a police informant in the Domican case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to make the first response to the government's response to a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS>, which was a report on violence in Australian schools. It is interesting when debating in this chamber that, unlike the major chamber of the House of Representatives, the enemy faces each other eyeball to eyeball across the chamber. This report of the committee, which is an all-party committee of this House, was a unanimous report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I learned a number of major things in participating in this inquiry. The first thing that I learned which was most significant is that teachers believe that those who commit physical violence generally lack self-esteem. The second thing that I learned which I believe is of significance is that over the past two decades, as a permissive society has developed, we have increasingly given children their rights, but, in the absence of parental discipline and the structures of dos and don'ts, children have been left to flounder, without direction and experience in how to take responsibility for their own actions and deal responsibly with their peers and with the broader community. That is a substantive problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third major thing that I learned during the inquiry was that there are models of school practice which generally exhibit strong leadership and a whole school approach, creating a culture of caring that negates both violence and bullying. In that respect, I discussed the experiences of Mayfield Primary School in Launceston. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has largely accepted the findings of our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to deal with some of the more major recommendations. The minister has said in his report that he believes that a series of forums on violence in schools held in each state and territory would be a very useful process for compiling the good practice that is occurring in schools around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no major philosophical disagreement with the minister about holding forums, but it seems to me, in a practical sense, that we would be doing an awful lot of spinning wheels, bringing together a lot of people for lots of discussions, which would simply parallel other meetings and other discussions. The committee mentality and structure carries on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have much preferred that the minister had accepted our recommendations in principle and then an expert go out and do some fact finding. Let us fund an expert to do some fact finding and report on the primary schools of Australia: to report on good practice, particularly where their practice has acted to almost totally eliminate the concept of bullying; to report on practices which have been successful in integrating strong approaches at dealing with problems of illiteracy, particularly in the early years of primary school; and to disseminate that information widely to primary and secondary schools throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An expert charged with this responsibility could call for submissions from schools that had demonstrated exemplary practice. That person could then collate the information and make it available. This would be more useful than holding a series of talkfests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister dealt firstly with our recommendation that the ministers of the Commonwealth, states and territories fund the evaluation of successful approaches adopted by schools. It was his response to hold a series of forums, which I have dealt with. However, he did go on in his recommendation and canvass the possibility that the Commonwealth would investigate establishing, in cooperation with the state and territory governments, a best practice award for schools that display leadership in this field. I commend the minister for that response; I think that will be really useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that we have learned through this committee, in travelling around the country, is that the apprenticeship awards&mdash;the awards that deal with excellence in the international skills olympics&mdash;have been a tremendous boost to TAFE colleges and to the apprenticeship systems around the country. Many of those young people who have participated in the international skills olympics have gone on to find rewarding, responsible and satisfying jobs very early in their careers. No doubt their participation in those skills olympics has enhanced their career prospects. They provide an example for their peers who are studying in the skills field. I compliment the minister on his suggestion for a best practice award and would suggest that that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended that the minister, in consultation with the states, finance the development of a national school violence data collection system. The minister has in total agreed with us. I thank the minister. The minister said that the Commonwealth will refer this recommendation to the School Statistics Taskforce of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs and that he would ask the task force to examine how more extensive national data on the issue can be obtained and how the data could be used for the development of performance indicators on school violence. That is a very good initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way the Commonwealth could now impose its will or the committee's will on the states, and nor should it. This is a complex area and involves issues such as: the definition of violence&mdash;and levels of violence; the issue of bullying and where it fits in those definitions; and how we report on those issues. It does need to be decided by consensus. All the states need to agree finally on a formula of definition so that the data collection can recommence throughout the country in an identical manner, so at the end of the day we have some numbers that are of use to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee was told anecdotally that physical violence was on the wane and that there was less physical violence in schools in Australia today than 30 or 40 years ago. That is a very positive outcome, but we are not sure if that is true. The problem is there is no data to back up the observations. We really need a comprehensive but simple data collection system that will give us some numbers and allow people to take actions based on the findings. For example, if some mechanisms in some states are working and producing outcomes which are better than the models in other states, certainly it would behove the states who are having poor results to take cognisance of the fact that they have colleagues in other places who seem to be doing it better, and perhaps they should shift their practices. This data collection issue is really quite important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of our recommendations was that the minister discuss with the state and territory ministers the need for early intervention strategies to address violent and anti-social behaviour in students. In part, the minister's response said that the Commonwealth government endorses the committee's finding that preventative action in the early years of schooling is far more likely to prove effective than any piecemeal or remedial solutions focused on students in older age groups. I thank the minister for that. We are convinced that is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get it right early, the chances are that behaviour will be vastly improved in the later years of schooling as well. However, we did receive some evidence that some young people who demonstrate no tendencies to violence or bullying in primary school seem to go a bit haywire under some peer pressure or community or social mores when they reach their teens, and there have to be different mechanisms to deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister talked about the gender and violence project, developing a video on violence for use in primary schools, but this issue is not just a gender issue. It is not just that little boys beat up on little girls or big boys beat up on big girls; in fact there was some anecdotal evidence that young girls are increasingly resorting to verbal bullying themselves, and that is quite worrying for many of our educators. I am not sure that this is totally a gender issue. Certainly, the physical violence occurs largely between young males&mdash;or young males physically violating young girls&mdash;but the bullying aspect seems to be more evenly balanced and the fact that there seems to be some increasing physical violence amongst young girls was worrying to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our recommendations was an examination of the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. The minister agrees with our concern that media and entertainment may have an effect on violence and behaviour of children, not only in the school setting but in the broader community. The minister says that the communications and the arts portfolio already makes a significant contribution to safeguarding the wellbeing of children in relation to media content. I think I would have to question the minister's statement. I am not totally convinced that our classification mechanisms do work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I turn on my television, which is rare I must admit, there certainly are days when no matter what channel I switch to there is nothing but violence on show. I am not convinced that that is for the betterment of our young people. I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has recently called for the examination of the possibility of a fourth free to air television channel, largely dedicated to families and children. I suppose that is worth exploring, although I am not sure that there is enough market and I think that market research would have to be done. I can tell you that many families would support a reduction in the amount of violence that we see on free to air television in Australia. Perhaps pay TV will help solve part of this problem. One can only hope, but we will never know until we get there and unfortunately we are a bit slow in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in discussing our recommendation on the International Year of the Family, the minister went on to compliment the government for supporting the parents' role in school education by providing $555,000 to the parents association over three years, and that is in rather dramatic conflict with the donation of the Minister for Health (Dr Lawrence) of a quarter of million dollars in one shot to the December issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS>, which goes out, unfortunately, to 13- to 18-year-old females, which I believe was inappropriate in all the circumstances, dealing with the issues that we are dealing with here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the government's response to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS>, a report on violence in Australian schools by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I acknowledge the contribution by the chair of that committee, the member for Forde (Ms Crawford), and the previous speaker, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who was the deputy chair of that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue of very considerable concern to parents. In my previous professional experience I had some involvement in counselling victims of violence in schools, and also as a parent, as I charted my own daughter's journey through primary and secondary education, I have been a concerned consumer in this area. It is very pleasing to note the general support of the government for the committee's report and a number of initiatives that the government is taking on board in response to this report. The response has actually been presented very quickly, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some comments about the general area. I certainly think there is a need for further research but also, as the government indicates, it is prepared to participate in the collection of data and the dissemination of that data to schools, particularly on the incidence as well as benchmarks and best practice options that the committee was able to pick up during the course of its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that I have some concern about is the evidence on the causal relationship between violence and self-esteem of the perpetrators and the victims. I believe there does need to be much more research into what determines why some children choose to bully. However, I acknowledge that it is not simply an individual psychological problem but that we have to look at a number of factors that cause violence in schools. I note the committee's comments on page 11, paragraph 2.3:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This committee agrees with the view that violence does not arise from a single cause.</PARA>
<PARA>In this, it agrees with the national committee on violence. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence suggested the following influences in the school context: the family; cultural factors, especially social and economic inequality; media influences; and aspects of the school environment.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that not only a whole of school approach is required to combat violence but a whole of community approach, and it does mean getting parents involved and out of school factors as well as media, and in particular the social structure of the school system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the initiatives that I as a parent was involved with in the primary school that my children attended was the development of a human relationships education program. This whole issue had a very long gestation and parents fought for it in the dark days of conservative rule in Queensland. When the green light was given for the development of human relationships education, a great deal was done by the Queensland education department to foster community involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of participants in my small mining community. What was interesting, I have to say, was that a minority group which represented&mdash;if one would describe it as such&mdash;a `fundamentalist Christian' position had a very narrow view of what should constitute a human relationships education. I would have to summarise it as a `God, queen, country and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS>' type of approach, with very limited opportunities to present the plurality of society. However, the consultation, with the support of the Queensland Department of Education, went ahead, and we developed a very positive program for our school community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that I believe is very important is the recognition of the power structures within a school. That very much involves having the adults in the school system be aware of the sort of power that they have, and of when the system can get into the abuse of power. It has been my experience, in observing children, that they have a very strong sense of social justice and are very aware when teachers override what could be seen as fair play or a fair and reasonable outcome. It is very important that teachers be aware of that when they use their power as adults: their power to be more articulate and more analytical, and to put students down. So, when we look at the structures that need to be in place to provide a really caring school, based on mutual respect, all relationships need to be taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very important findings of the committee is in relation to the importance of early intervention. I quote from page 8 of the introduction. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority of evidence suggests that inappropriate behaviours are identifiably in children as early as pre-school and kindergarten. Changing a child's behaviour patterns after the age of eight requires significantly more resourcing, with reduced changes of success, than if the problem was addressed in the earliest schooling years.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, I can remember observing a number of children who went right through kindergarten, preschool and grades one and two with my daughters. It was very clear that they had already embarked upon a career that would ultimately isolate them and nominate them as troublemakers and difficult children. I then saw the responses that were used&mdash;being, at that time, very traditional school discipline responses&mdash;having absolutely no success at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage, I was not practising professionally, but I was bringing my professional eye to my observations. Living in a small community, I could also see the complementary family problems that were contributing to the way these children would present at school. I was feeling very concerned to know that this would be the ultimate outcome for these children. So I fully endorse the recommendation of the committee about the need for early intervention strategies, and I endorse the response from the government in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important area that I think we should spend a couple of minutes on is the types of violence. If one looks at the media representations, one tends to see the more overt type of bullying. But, as the previous speaker said, actual, overt physical violence&mdash;the `putting kids' heads down the toilets' type of harassment, which still happens&mdash;is less rare than other forms of bullying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the other forms of bullying are particularly destructive to the developing self-esteem of young people. I quote from page 7. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was told that one of the biggest unrecognised aspects of violence in schools was gender harassment. As a component of violence, it was widespread in schools and was largely unrecognised as a violent act. One survey found that, as part of their day to day routine, girls in co-educational classrooms and school yards suffered sex-based harassment from boys and sometimes teachers. The Committee was also advised that physical violence amongst girls was more likely to occur than it was in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>That was mentioned by the previous speaker. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Harassment and violence is also directed towards gay, lesbian and bisexual students.</PARA>
<PARA>On that point, I want to quote from an article headed `Homophobia starts at school, let's stop it here' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 1 March&mdash;just yesterday, in fact&mdash;which gives an account of a high school assembly on 1 August last year where it was suggested that an absent student was gay. When this student attempted to have redress for this accusation, and the resulting hostility and isolation, he got no support at all. I gather this case is now subject to some further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the newer types of harassment&mdash;attempting to pigeonhole all the students in terms of their gender orientation. But it is absolutely inappropriate, whether it be in grade two or in grade eight or nine, where I believe it reaches its zenith. It is a way of isolating and imposing a power differential. Often that involves a peer group&mdash;there is an in-group and an out-group, whether it is the cool group and the not-so-cool group or some other group. But to raise suggestions that someone is not in the mainstream of heterosexual orientation is very distressing to many students who, of course, have not really developed a clear sexual orientation. It is very important that those kinds of issues are addressed and students learn to understand the type of process in which they are all unconsciously involved. I have certainly seen this operating in schools in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Racism and talking about different ethnic backgrounds is very important. The other issue that is part of this is where students are different and I suspect this is what the previous speaker was mentioning. Gender harassment is not all about violence from one sex to the other, although the evidence indicates that it is males who primarily are the perpetrators. However, it is about students who are different, and one of the things that all schools must address is the importance of allowing people to be themselves. Not everybody is going to be the best cricketer, the best netball player, the most beautiful, most Elle look-alike girl in the school, or the person who looks like whoever the male role models are at the moment&mdash;probably Shane Warne or someone. </PARA>

I believe it is a very important part of the whole school approach to allow boys to be more feminine and more interested in quieter pursuits, to allow girls to be more assertive and interested in sport and computers, to allow variation and to help students and teachers value that individual difference in people. Teaching students assertive techniques and to be constructively assertive, rather than aggressive, is very important. But clarifying communication is also very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the gender violence issue, the other part of that that we have to address is the structural inequality in many schools. As the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training said on page 14 of its report on violence in Australian schools:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee understands that while eighty per cent of teachers in primary schools are women, only twenty to thirty per cent are principals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the comments made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). Having heard the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), I am sure there are a lot of people on both sides of the chamber who have dealt with school violence and its results. The member for Capricornia, of course, is a former social worker. I am sure that she has seen that for herself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take much time from the comments I am just about to make but&mdash;with all due respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;I find it quite extraordinary that we are addressing a report on violence in Australian schools which is of the utmost importance to parents right throughout Australia in what I consider the Clayton's chamber. My views on the necessity for this chamber are well known. I think it is a disgrace that we are not debating this downstairs. Again, I hasten to add, that is said with no disrespect intended to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words before the Main Committee as we take note of the government response to the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS>, on the issue of violence in Australian schools. The issue of school violence is justifiably of great concern to many in the community. As a parent, I do not think it is too much to expect my children to feel safe and secure when I leave them at school in the morning. I would also expect that my children would learn both respect and responsibility for their fellow students. I think this is an expectation shared by all parents but, regrettably, for some it is not a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent MBF survey conducted in New South Wales found that a vast majority of primary school children starting high school feared initiation ceremonies and bullying by older students. This fear is real; this fear is genuine. Ms Victoria King, an education consultant from Victoria, states quite correctly that students had limited&mdash;what she called&mdash;coping skills to deal with being put down or to deal with conflict and bullying. It is these limited coping abilities which result in violence in schools having such a detrimental effect on the victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research conducted in the ACT suggested that nearly a quarter of children were likely to be physically or verbally harassed. However, as bullying rarely occurs in front of an adult witness, it is quite possible that this figure could be higher. I am pleased to say that many states and territories have already recognised the seriousness of this problem and are putting in place strategies to combat it. For example, the ACT education department will move this year to implement an across-the-board policy on school bullying and similar moves are under way in other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, the government has instigated a school based program called `Enough's enough'. It is based on the findings of a study which found boys verbally attacked girls on the basis of their sex and boys also suffered similar attacks from other boys if they were seen as too feminine. Indeed, the member for Capricornia has raised an issue that has come to light in the last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know how cruel children can be. Unfortunately, what is now called abuse will possibly always be a part of growing up. But what starts out as children acting as children always have, and possibly always will, can become very serious and a cause of great concern for both the children themselves and their parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently received a letter from a constituent which really brought home to me what we are talking about in this chamber today. I would like to read a section of this letter because I believe that it provides us with an opportunity to focus on the real life consequences of bullying. The names, of course, have been changed. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing on behalf of my daughter Jane . . . My daughter was descending the stairs during her practical cooking class to do an assignment outside. She was accompanied by Lucy also in that class. The other girls had gone ahead a bit earlier. Lucy was on Jane's right and just after starting down the stairs Lucy put her leg out and tripped Jane. Jane fell between 4-8 stairs before stopping. Lucy stopped for a few seconds, saw a graze on Jane's right wrist then sniggered and continued on down the stairs and out to the other girls. As Jane fell she twisted around catching and ripping a hole in her top from a piece of wire sticking out from the banister. She hit her head, right shoulder, right elbow, left knee and landed on the back of her right hand, not the palm . . . We went to the hospital for a bone scan. There is `uptake' to the right hand and wrist and we were informed that she needed extensive physiotherapy and must see an Orthopaedic Surgeon for follow up treatment and another bone scan. While waiting at the bus stop to go to the hospital Jane was harassed by other students at the college who called her a `snob' sarcastically mocking her injury and how it occurred. We took Jane to the College to take back the homework she had managed to do, when one of the girls at the College advised Jane not to walk down any dark alleys as, in her words, she might get `egged'. We are a low income family and we cannot meet the expenses for the physiotherapist or Orthopaedic Surgeon. I realise that this appears to be a silly scrabble between teenagers but my daughter has been injured.</PARA>
<PARA>It may come as a surprise to many in this chamber that this incident occurred between 17-year-old girls, people on the verge of being treated as adults. Action following the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> report should aim to give hope to the Janes across Australia, and to not allow such incidents to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the main report makes a valuable contribution to a debate that involves schools, parents, teachers and state education departments throughout the country. The coalition enthusiastically embraces the view of the committee that Australia's schools must provide a safe environment where teachers and students alike can learn, work, play and interact free from fear and abuse. The coalition also supports the committee's finding that it is the right combination of action at the school level that can have the most effective impact on addressing violence in our schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the committee's findings show is that strong leadership provided by the principal combined with the teachers working together on the basis of a whole school approach in addressing school violence have proven to be the most effective way of achieving changes in student behaviour. Critical in ensuring such positive changes in student behaviour is maximum involvement by parents and students. Such programs are already successfully operating across Australia, and I commend the report for acknowledging the role they play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this report has my support, some comment needs to be made about certain aspects of the government's response, which again shows the extent to which this government has become glass jawed. Lately it seems that when faced with the slightest bit of criticism about its performance the government reels back and resorts to half truths and distortion of the facts. The government and the minister have clearly been stung by the report's findings and this is clearly evidenced by the contents of the response which is before the chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first 12 pages of the response are the standard reply that the coalition and the community have come to expect: nothing new, just your typical Labor rhetoric which will result in little or no action. The only proviso I place on that statement is that with an election due the government may act&mdash;or, more likely, appear to act&mdash;for the most cynical of purposes and that is its re-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining 21 pages of the document are committed to the government indulging itself in self-glorification. No matter how long the bow is drawn it has fallen over itself to explain ways in which it has allegedly supported or addressed issues raised by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> report. And no stone is left unturned. All this, however, is a rather pathetic attempt to deflect some of the criticisms and conclusions which the committee has drawn. Labor falsely prides itself on being able to lead the country. Leadership is about being able to take on board criticism and learn from it; it is not about indulging in an orgy of self-glorification every time someone suggests ways in which issues could be better handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee reached a very understandable conclusion, and that is that school violence is the end result of a number of factors. The committee has identified family breakdown, illiteracy, violent movies and television as just three of many factors which contribute to violence in schools. I read with interest in the government's response that it claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . more details about the funding arrangements for improving government services to families are given in section 4.</PARA>
<PARA>But nowhere in section 4 do we find details of Labor's true commitment&mdash;or, more truthfully put, its lack of commitment&mdash;to families. The promised tax cuts, which were to be l-a-w, turned out to be a l-i-e. Or what about the taxation and family payments system, which is biased against families, giving too little recognition to the expense of bringing up children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the government could have mentioned that over 800,000 dependants are in families where no parent has a job, or the widening gap between rich and poor with 78 per cent of those in poverty being family members and 64 per cent of these being in families with children. Again, the government failed to mention the derailed child-care system which in September 1993 saw 214,000 women claiming that the absence of child-care options was the main reason they were not actively looking for work, with 26 per cent of women identifying lack of child-care options as their major career barrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, it might seem to be drawing a long bow to discuss these matters, but when you look at the government's response you will see the long bow that the government has drawn to justify its lack of action. Perhaps the government could have finally mentioned how it has relied on interest rates to squeeze families financially, by constantly lifting home mortgage rates and, even as we speak, keeping families in doubt as to whether they will be undergoing further interest rate rises or even tax rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this, unfortunately, is mentioned. Neither is the fact that a recent, independent report showed that some 30,000 secondary school students become homeless over a year. Instead, the government has devoted 21 pages to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following national policy initiatives and programs, in which the Commonwealth plays a major role . . . provide structures and support for schools and systems. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, families. Let me turn to the issue of literacy. The committee concluded, and I quote, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the views of principals and teachers that there is a link between student behaviour and poor literacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee goes further, to recommend that a concerted literacy program would lead to reduced levels of anti-social behaviour in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true extent of literacy in this country was revealed by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in an interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">SBS World News</EMPHASIS> on 18 January this year. The minister was asked what the current state of our literacy was. He replied, `We're not sure.' The minister says `not sure', despite the schools council report of December 1994 showing that up to 25 per cent of Australian school children are battling literacy problems, despite the International Literacy Year in 1990, the International Literacy Day on 8 September 1990, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge: strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children</EMPHASIS> of December 1992, early literacy programs, adult literacy programs, the 1991 Australian language and literacy policy, the `Book it' program of 1990 and the literacy awards in 1992. After all this, the minister says, `We're not too sure about the state of our literacy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that the government is somewhat confused by the relationship that the committee says exists between literacy and school violence. Remember the committee explicitly stated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee supports the views of principals and teachers that there is a link between student behaviour and poor literacy.</PARA>
<PARA>However, to quote from the response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the causes of violence in schools are many and varied, and notes that any causal link between literacy and violence is not established.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only does the government not agree with the views of principals and teachers, but, it would appear, the government disagrees with the committee and, therefore, does not agree with its own members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fallacy of the government's position on this issue is no more clearly shown than on page 34 of the response, where it proudly asserts that the students at risk&mdash;Star&mdash;program funds a range of school based projects which may assist in addressing violence in schools. Guess what one of the programs is which Star suggests will address violence in high schools? You guessed it, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is basic literacy. The government has fallen in a heap on the issue of literacy. When trying to justify its failings, it does little more than expose its total confusion and ineptness on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many examples of the government's attempting to deflect conclusions made by the committee. So insecure is the government on this issue that it has deliberately tried to avoid the committee's findings. The report identifies increasing retention rates and changes in student population as factors that encourage violence in schools. I stress that the committee did not state that these factors cause school violence, but merely stated that they encourage violence in schools. However, so stung is the government by this claim that the government response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assertion is made in the context of assumptions about causes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat `causes'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which have not been supported by credible research.</PARA>
<PARA>That comment demeans the extensive and far-reaching results of the committee inquiry, pays no regard to the committee's very exhaustive investigation into violence in schools, and is a totally unwarranted attack on the members of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that the standard, conclusions and recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training are in stark contrast to this pitiful reply made by the government. Where the committee has sought answers, the government has sought excuses. Where the committee has sought to place responsibility, the government has run a mile from it. Where the committee has sought team work, cooperation and facts, the government has sought to demean the committee's work and to demean the outcome of the committee's exhaustive inquiries. When taking note of the paper, let the House take note of the quality of the report&mdash;a quality that stands in stark contrast to the qualities of the government's response. I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the government's response should be called `12 pages of platitudes and 21 pages of excuses'. </PARA>

Let us not get facts in the way of a good story!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In taking note of the government's response to the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones: report on violence in Australian schools</EMPHASIS>, I would like to comment on four of the seven major matters raised. They are positive parenting, best practice in schools, data collection in schools and early intervention. Parents are key partners in education. Their role as primary educators of their children and their continuing support during the years of schooling are critical elements in ensuring successful outcomes from their children's education. Along with those statements, the Commonwealth government recognises the pivotal role that parents need to play in strategies to tackle violence in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in this chamber would disagree with the sentiments of the government's response, but what exactly is positive parenting? What are the fundamental and essential attributes? I spent 25 years of my working life as a teacher and a principal of primary-aged children and obviously I came across children predisposed to verbal and physical violence and antisocial behaviour. In dealing with those children and their parents, I learned by experience and analysis of what happened that certain characteristics were always common. The child always had a parent or parents whose own behaviour and relationship with the child were dominated by inconsistency. Let me try and explain with a few real life examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember a child whose parents were obviously part of the alternative society. In that family there were very few, if any, rules other than that, if a problem arose, a situational negotiation took place to attempt to solve it. The parents' dress and behaviour was often remarked on in the community as outlandish, and I am sure that the parents in question enjoyed their shock on the local community with quiet humour. However, the point I want to make is that the child was very well adjusted indeed, and in fact was a real asset to the school community. From the child's point of view&mdash;and that is often overlooked&mdash;his parents, in their behaviour and relationship with him, were totally consistent, fair, predictable, and providing the child with the necessary security and certainty in dealing with everyday situations, without the need to resort to verbal or physical violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also experienced examples at the other end of the spectrum from that laissez-faire example. Another child I remember had parents who had a rule for everything and a punishment that, without exception, was always carried out if a rule was transgressed. It was a very strict household but, as with the laissez-faire family, I would not try to emulate it myself. Nevertheless, the child from that strict family was extremely well adjusted. Again, from the child's point of view, his parents were fair, consistent and totally predictable&mdash;even if I thought they were too strict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, whether parents were strict or laissez-faire or somewhere in between did not seem to matter, as long as the relationship was consistent between the parents and the child. It also did not seem to matter&mdash;and this goes against a lot of the research&mdash;whether the child was a girl or a boy. Gender issues did not matter. Socioeconomic status did not seem to matter. Religious, cultural or racial status did not matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, and without exception, all children I have dealt with who were predisposed to violence had a parent or parents unable or unwilling to develop a relationship with their offspring that could be described as consistent. The result was children whose sense of self-worth was confused, diminished, or even inflated; whose relationships with other children and adults were marked with conflict; and whose skills in dealing with often everyday trivial circumstances were minimal. The point I make about positive parenting, and I much prefer to call it `consistent' parenting, is that the views of children themselves must be valued and acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I welcome the government's response on initiatives to ask parent groups to provide advice about the role schools should play in promoting positive parenting, and I acknowledge the positive parenting approach underpinning the national prevention strategy for child abuse and neglect&mdash;as well as a major community education campaign and an independent assessment of all major parenting programs currently delivered in Australia&mdash;that information will never be complete or effectual, and will provide a poor framework for policy if the views of children themselves are ignored. All the partners in the relationships between children and adults need to be considered, and to leave children out of the equation is totally unacceptable and downright foolhardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many schools in this country which, in different ways, exemplify outstanding behaviour and school management&mdash;and then there are others in both the private and the public system. I find it very hard to accept that, after well over 100 years of compulsory education in Australia, some things have simply not changed in many primary schools. The most remarkable aspect is the basic structure used in these schools: that is, one teacher is largely responsible for the school education of a class of around 30 children for 10 months of the year. That structure is repeated year in, year out, for seven years. It is too bad if there is a relationship breakdown or indifference between pupil and student; too bad if the teacher has neither the interest nor the skill in the four major curriculum areas of language&mdash;including a foreign language&mdash;mathematics, environmental studies and the expressive arts and physical education. In 25 years I have never seen a teacher expert in all of those areas; the expectation that any teacher could be is totally unrealistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty years ago, some primary teachers could get away with basic English, simple arithmetic, a bit of history and geography, music lessons from a radio broadcast, a pastel lesson once a week and a game in the park. But that curriculum structure is long gone; it has outlived its usefulness. Today, primary teachers are expected to teach all aspects of language, including a foreign language. They are expected to teach all aspects of mathematics: sets, logic, graphing, basic algebra, geometry and numeration. They are expected to be up to date with computer and information technology. They are expected to teach health and science. They are expected to teach environmental studies. They are expected to be aware of behaviour management, gender issues, sociology, psychology, collaborative learning and to be sensitive to cultural and racial matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children need to be skilfully exposed to all of that curriculum. No-one would disagree with that contention. The problem is that no one teacher has the interest or the skills to do what is expected. The expectation from the community and government that teachers should do this is patently ridiculous. It is too bad if you are a child with a teacher whose interests and skills differ&mdash;you are stuck. Bored and uninterested students are potentially violent and anti-social students. Students unable to succeed in their chosen areas are potentially violent and anti-social students. Students unable to develop a positive relationship with a teacher, because of different interests or personality, are potentially violent and anti-social students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief determinant of a successful school will always be a quality education program, enhanced by the principal's leadership, in which a group of teachers&mdash;not individuals&mdash;with complementary skills and interests are responsible for children: that is, the children in any school year will be exposed to several teachers and not just one. However, with the teacher resources available in most primary schools, that is not possible. In many cases it cannot even be considered. But in the few schools that do expose children to a range of teachers, what do we find? We find that behaviour management is a very minor issue. It does not matter whether they are middle class or working class or top-of-the-range schools. Interested, motivated, happy, enthusiastic students do not become behaviour problems, irrespective of their home circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am, therefore, very pleased that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has indicated a willingness to investigate the possibility of establishing, in cooperation with state and territory governments&mdash;we might remember that these are the people who are largely responsible for the education of these children&mdash;and non-government school authorities a best practice award for schools that display leadership. They are out there, but they are seldom acknowledged other than in their local community, and even then sometimes not acknowledged for the right reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area I would like to address is the matter of data collection in schools. It is extremely important that the Commonwealth support the standing committee proposal for a consistent approach to the collection of accurate data, not only on violence but on a whole range of matters that affect our younger generation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current data on primary schools in this nation is appalling and it is a very sad indictment of state governments, bureaucracies and the education community in general.

Young children in this nation are served poorly by this nation. What national organisation has successfully looked after the interests of the children under 12? No-one in this chamber could name one, because the answer is `None.' Yet here we are, in an age of national lobby groups for everything&mdash;almost one for ink lovers; you name it, there is a national lobby group.

Does something magic occur to children in the Christmas vacation before entry to secondary school? Does paper cost more, do books cost more, do photocopiers cost more? Nonsense. Why are there, for exactly the same number of students, up to half as many teaching staff in a primary school as in a secondary school or TAFE institution?

Poor parenting increases the risk dramatically. Poor schooling also increases the risk dramatically. Add a failure by the community and governments to adequately allocate a fair share of resources to children aged five to 12, and this nation has a recipe for a monumental and very expensive problem which is now evident to anyone who cares to observe what happens in schools and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early intervention works. Many members here this morning have mentioned that. It is cheaper than remedial measures. Remedial measures often do not work, and the increasing need for remedial measures in schools is ample evidence of system failure. Early intervention makes good sense, and prevention is cheaper and more effective than cure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the standing committee's report, and I commend the minister for the government's response in moving the debate onwards; but no-one ought to be deluded. This nation needs to acknowledge the needs of young children, and eventually will be forced to do so for a very simple and fundamental reason: that it is in the best interests of this nation, in a very non-forgiving and highly competitive world that will be ever more so in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this opportunity to take note of the report this morning, members of both the opposition and the government have shown that there is a great deal of interest in this; but there has to be a lot more than talk. It is time that a group of people in Australia who have the most minimal resources spent upon them by state and federal governments is recognised, because it is in all of our interests that children get off to a very good start, both socially and academically and in all other ways. That happens in our primary schools and in the relationships between parents and children. They need assistance, and it is time both Commonwealth and state governments, with all the members of this parliament, recognised that. I thank you for the extension of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And should be, I clearly agree. I simply did not want him to feel that for some strange reason, because we were not being antagonistic, we in some way belittled the contribution he had made. I would also say that it reflected the professionalism that he brings into this chamber in view of his 25 years of experience in the teaching profession. I was very appreciative of the illustrations he brought from the experiences he had had as an educator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not one who has had any professional involvement in education at all. But I have, in common with other people in the chamber, an interest in what education is all about; because I am, in common with most others, a parent. As a parent all too frequently absent from the role that ought to be exercised in the education of children&mdash;and that is a frustration we all face as members of the federal parliament&mdash;I nonetheless have endeavoured to be familiar with what was happening to my children in schools. I have been advantaged by the fact that my wife was herself, prior to the children arriving, a secondary school teacher, and that she is therefore anxious to ensure that their education is of the highest order. She has always kept me briefed on what she thought were the various strengths and weaknesses of their education and of the schools they were attending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In thumbing through the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I am not on the standing committee, so I was not directly involved in its preparation&mdash;what impressed me most was that violence is not a regular feature of Australian school life. That was an observation I expected to be able to make, because my children have not been any more exposed to bullying and violent behaviour than I was 40 years ago, as illustrated by the comments by member for Port Adelaide. In fact, as other members would be aware, the reports of antisocial and violent behaviour in New South Wales schools affected, it was alleged, only 0.04 per cent of students. In the case of ACT schools, in 1991 the number of suspensions was 447 out of 40,000 students, representing 0.01 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My observations are that my children are no more exposed to verbal harassment and physical harassment than I was&mdash;and, in fact, probably less so. I think that children have a right, as everyone else would agree, to attend a school feeling safe and secure, being reassured that they will not be belittled, and to feel that, in the school environment, they will have a real opportunity for their own self-esteem to be enhanced. If there is one thing that has been brought home to me as a parent, it is that the self-esteem of individual children is of fundamental importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Port Adelaide reinforced this not only with the illustrations he used from his own experience but also with the comments he made as a professional. If people feel they have self-worth and feel they have a contribution to make to society, it is highly unlikely that they will be involved in violent behaviour. I have only one problem with the honourable member for Port Adelaide's comments. He said that interested, motivated, enthusiastic students do not become problems regardless of their home background. I expect he is right; however, very few interested, motivated, enthusiastic students come out of a difficult home background. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rather than debate this across the chamber, we can pick it up later. I am merely making the observation that it is much easier to be an interested, motivated and enthusiastic student if the parents have already cultivated that sense of enthusiasm at home. I well remember what for me was the most terrorising book I have read. I read it very early in my primary school days, which was probably a mistake. I was amused by one of my colleagues who observed the other day that the best three years of his life had been spent in year one&mdash;that was a mischievous remark. I remember that it was not long after I acquired the capacity to read that someone gave me the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tom Brown's Schooldays</EMPHASIS>. I read it and I was mortified. I feared that I would experience either in the latter part of primary school or in secondary school the sort of bullying that was characterised in the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tom Brown's Schooldays</EMPHASIS>. I was obviously much too immature to have read the book at the time; it set an artificial scene for me of what secondary school life would be like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For most of us, some sort of verbal harassment and, I suspect, for most of our generation, some physical harassment was a reality of the schools in which we grew up. That did not make it defensible, but it was a reality, and I suspect that exhibits itself less frequently today than it did in my own day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my experience as a parent, bullying and harassment is less of a feature of all-girls schools than it is of all-boys schools. My children spent their primary school years in public schools. They spent their secondary schooling in private schools, with the exception of one child, who had two years of his secondary schooling in a public school. From my daughter's experience in an all-girls school in Adelaide, it was the best thing we did for her. Her sense of self-esteem was enhanced and there was relatively little physical bullying. Of course, there was some verbal bullying that characterises what we would loosely call&mdash;and I use the term advisedly&mdash;the `bitchiness' of an all-girls school environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, my oldest son for the latter part of his secondary schooling went to an all-boys school where bullying was more a part of the scene&mdash;and we all know what goes on at all-boys schools. As a result of his experience, we have sent our younger son to a school catering for both sexes. Lest it be thought that I am being critical of the schooling experience of my older son, I should say that, in confronting the headmaster with our decision not to send our younger son there, I was impressed with what had been done in the intervening years by that school community to address the problem of both bullying and verbal abuse. I frame my remarks this morning around the fact that I believe that, without exception, switched-on schools are doing something about bullying and verbal abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up the remarks made by the member for Port Adelaide. I entirely agree with him that it does not matter whether it is a private school or a public school; what is happening in violence in schools is very much a reflection on the principal and the staff of a school. My own view of the public school system has been that my children were being well served there by teachers who deserved to be paid twice the salary they were being paid, because of the effort they put into effectively parenting at school, and were served there by other teachers who were not worth feeding and who could not be disciplined in an effective way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt the member for Port Adelaide faced some of this frustration as a principal when he had staff members for whom he wanted to offer a greater remuneration and was unable to do so, and staff members whom he would gladly have shown the front gate but was unable to do so. And that has been one of the difficulties that I felt has characterised the public school system more markedly&mdash;not exclusively but more markedly&mdash;than the private school system. What is important for all of us is to ensure that our children, both at home and at school, have a real sense of self-worth and self-importance. Any form of bullying, whether it is physical or verbal, breaks that down and does untold damage that takes a long time to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up the recommendations that were made to the minister and his response. I am not quite as enthusiastic as the member for Port Adelaide about data collection, though I clearly recognise his professionalism in this area. My attitude comes rather as an observing parent. The first recommendation was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in consultation with state and territory ministers for education, fund the evaluation of successful approaches adopted by schools to determine the best practice, and that the result of that evaluation be published and disseminated. This recommendation was encouraging the ministers to hold a series of forums and to thoroughly consider the practices that were working effectively in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That recommendation ran parallel to the second recommendation, which was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training finance the development of a national school violence data collection system referred to by the member for Port Adelaide. My own view was that, frankly, it is not this sort of data that we need as much as we need concerned parents anxious to ensure that at home there is a positive home environment to reinforce the positive environment that we would seek to cultivate in schools. It may well be that data collection is necessary, but I fear that data collection of itself achieves very little and I would not want the resources funnelled into data collection to be at the expense of resources that we could make available to encourage young parents to be more effective and more positive parents and to take the assets they have in children and build them up and give them a greater sense of self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third recommendation was that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training discuss with state and territory ministers the need for early intervention strategies to address violent and anti-social behaviour in students. We would all agree with that. I think it is important that students' capacity to live with others, to cooperate with others and to recognise the worth of others is inculcated at an early age, because the later it gets the harder it is to develop the sort of human behaviour techniques that we would want to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation was that the Minister for Communications and the Arts examine the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. This is a recommendation that has largely been endorsed by people on both sides of this chamber, and the plea has been for greater recognition of the damage that violent television viewing can do to young minds. It is the reason we have some sort of categorisation system and it is the reason all of us, as concerned parents, are very anxious to ensure that our children do not see the sort of movies that we would not want them to see. The problem we face, once again, is where there has been family breakdown and there is not the same level of intervention in children's viewing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up the interesting remark made by the member for Port Adelaide about a family experience he had had where the parents were rather laissez-faire in their approach to upbringing and the children were nonetheless well adjusted because the children knew the parents cared. The secret, of course, is in reassuring parents and children, where they are in a disciplined house, or what we would call a relatively non-disciplined house, that mum and dad are worried about their outcome. In that sort of environment, what they view is conditioned by mum and dad's attitude anyway. It is to those who grow up in families where mum and dad clearly appear not to care that the damage is truly done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I reluctantly went to see the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Once Were Warriors</EMPHASIS>. My post-teenage children recommended that father should see it. I was sure they were anxious to cultivate what little was left of my left-wing tendencies. I was wrong. It was an excellent movie. I recommend it to everyone. It was a very graphic illustration, not of domestic violence in an horrific sense, but of the way in which a particular circumstance makes domestic violence almost inevitable. I left the movie chastened by what I had seen. I recommend <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Once Were Warriors</EMPHASIS> because it illustrates how the breakdown of family life has an impact on every individual member of the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the recommendation that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training review the attendance and performance eligibility criteria for Austudy for students in years 11 and 12. I represent an electorate in which Austudy is a major problem. The major problem is not that the criteria are unfair. In fact, having spent a lot of time following up Austudy cases, I am not a critic of the way in which the government administers it. The problem that I face&mdash;and it is a problem the government is familiar with&mdash;is in terms of people who remain asset rich and, particularly in recent times, cash poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have a simple solution to make Austudy available to those in rural areas who have assets that they cannot readily dispose of because they need them in order to run an effective business when, in this case, the drought is over. However, no doubt there are many cases where the capacity to educate children is directly affected by the unavailability of Austudy. I encourage the government to look at the way in which Austudy is administered, particularly in rural areas. A number of people are denied it because of their assets, but they are unable to offer their children in years 11 and 12 and in tertiary education the sort of education those children need. This builds up frustration, which can lead to violent behaviour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also compliment the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) on his excellent speech on school violence. This subject is something near and dear to me as, like the member for Port Adelaide, prior to coming into parliament a couple of years ago, I had been in the teaching profession for most of my working life. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion to take note of the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on violence in schools, which is commonly known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the committee and as a former school teacher, I appreciated the opportunity during the inquiry to broaden my understanding of what to me has always been a most pressing problem, not just for education but because it impacts on so many other aspects of society. While travelling around Australia, hearing from state departments, principals, teachers, parents, and students, one soon gained a feel for what is happening throughout the country. One of the aspects that I enjoy about being a politician is getting the big picture in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pleasing to note, as it said in the introduction to its response, that the government welcomes the report. It says that the report is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A timely and important contribution to the current debate in Australia about the nature, impact and incidence of violence in our schools.</PARA>
<PARA>As previous speakers have noted, the issue of violence in schools is a very complex one, and there are no simplistic answers. Unfortunately, many people in our society&mdash;including many politicians&mdash;seem to think that the whole issue can be dealt with by schools and within schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the common problems is that many politicians do not focus, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide said, on the primary school years. We are taken to universities, technical colleges and institutes of further education and we are overwhelmed by the technological impact of what we see. Thus, we think that we should fund those areas. However, when we go into a grade 1 class and see a young teacher with 30 young children in front of her imparting knowledge, values, ideals and basic learning techniques, we cannot see any benefit. It is all theoretical. It is only 10 years later that the impact of what has or has not been done in those very formative years becomes obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manifestation of violence or anti-social behaviour within the precincts of schools very often has nothing to do with what is happening in the educative process of the child. But because it does happen in schools, teachers, students, social workers and parents are forced to intervene in order to impose some order. Very often due to inadequate resources they are never able to properly address the real reason behind the violent outburst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to provide honourable members with some first-hand true anecdotes of such anti-social behaviour to highlight and complement the recommendations from the report and the government's response to them. The first example is of young Brian. I well remember him coming to school. Not long after we had started work early in the morning in the grade 4 class he violently and without provocation assaulted one of his classmates. I had been teaching for quite a few years at that stage and sensed that something was not quite right. Because he trusted me, after some reluctance and embarrassment on his part and having been withdrawn from the rest of the class, he tearfully explained to me the reason behind his outburst. By the way, it was a very hot day and it was rather unusual that he was wearing a polo-neck jumper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He finally peeled back the jumper to show me the cuts on his neck where his mother's boyfriend had used a knife to assert his authority over the young child. Brian's mum had just had a new baby by the boyfriend and Brian really was not wanted as part of the new family. He came to school angry and frustrated and hit out at the first person that he came in contact with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we had adequate counselling facilities at that school, the social worker from the department of welfare was quickly able to become involved and the local police responded rapidly and effectively, I am pleased to say that Brian today is a very well adjusted young man who recently finished his apprenticeship and is now living in a loving relationship with his family. That was possible only because we had the resources there and because the teachers fostered a caring atmosphere in the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the inquiry noted, the community at large is becoming increasingly concerned about violence in schools. This concern is placing increased pressure on state governments, which is resulting in the issue gaining a high priority. As previous speakers have mentioned, programs are now being introduced by the states and territories to alleviate this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note that when the inquiry was in full swing only the states of South Australia and Queensland and the territory of the ACT bothered to make submissions. It was rather disappointing that in the case of my state, Tasmania, rather than get involved in the inquiry, the government handed the task over to a Tasmanian education council to do its own special report. Its report consequently dwelt on the problem from an educational perspective in total isolation. The announcement on the solving of the problem was to provide an additional teacher to every secondary school and college to handle disruptive students. To me, that is far too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, as a society, we have two issues to address: firstly, to put in place programs to solve the current problems; and, secondly, to ensure that we have in place strategies which will reduce the number of children leaving primary schools who are still at risk. Just to address the first issue is self-defeating. The numbers keep on rising and the problems will surely escalate to what is happening overseas, especially in the United States of America. I have had the privilege&mdash;doubtful though it might be&mdash;of actually working in schools there, and I know exactly what the problems are that they face: they are horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all states, as the member for Port Adelaide mentioned, education departments have initiated large cutbacks, especially in the area of support staff. I think it is vital that all primary schools have a full quota of specialist teachers. In most schools in Tasmania&mdash;in primary schools&mdash;there are in excess of $70,000 or $80,000 of library books and no librarians. There are no music, phys. ed. or special ed. teachers, and those kids are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we found out in the violence in schools report, close to 15 per cent of primary school children who leave and go to high schools are now at risk. We need to solve the problem before they leave. From my 20-odd years in primary school teaching, one of the ways is through providing strategies and teachers to enable a child to reach his or her full potential in those specialist areas as well as providing the excellent teaching that takes place in the classrooms. We will not then be putting those children at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, one of the principal recommendations and one which I think the government supports wholeheartedly is the need for this identification of best practice in schools. As the previous members have mentioned, too many schools in Australia have been working in isolation and merely solving the problems associated with their own neighbourhood. Their best practice school behaviour, peer support and development of a school-wide ethos of non-violence must be extended throughout the nation. Part 1.12 in the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A whole school approach to student behaviour necessarily involves a number of elements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the provision of a caring environment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the establishment of firm behaviour limits where students' rights and responsibilities are clearly stated;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the implementation of fair and consistent sanctions when rules are transgressed;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.monitoring of children's behaviour both in the classroom and playground;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the adoption of a method of `mediating' poor student behaviour;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the training of staff in `mediation'; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the encouragement of parental involvement in their children's lives. </PARA>
<PARA>All these sound so simple and so self evident, but I can assure members that these criteria are missing in many schools throughout our nation. I can take members to a school close to my electorate office where the primary school principal refuses to allow parents to become involved in his school. There are schools where caning is still meted out to deter anti-social behaviour. These activities are knowingly condoned by the education departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate I am delighted to say that we have some visionary teachers who, despite all the setbacks, have some wonderful early intervention programs. I would like to take this opportunity to note them in public: Herdsmans Cove Primary School and the excellent work of Doreen Lutjens in running an early intervention program pre-school for in excess of 60 parents and about 90 children; Geilston Bay High School under Trevor Rootes; Rugby High School under Greg Cairnduff; Geeveston District High School and the excellent work in the Star program by Greg Suitor; Bridgewater High School and the tireless work in the intervention process by Graham Speight; and, Peter Marmion and his wonderful staff at Franklin Primary School. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the federal government's support for a series of forums on schools held in each state and territory. I think it is essential that, rather than having the bureaucrats and the experts as the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) mentioned, we identify these best practice schools, document what they are doing, have them talk together and then follow up the key findings of these forums and develop policies, programs and performance indicators based on their best practice activities. These best practice schools do have the answers. We need the bureaucrats from the education department and from the departments of community welfare, health, housing, sport and recreation, and community services, to be able to listen in and find out just how important their roles are in this process. It is not just an issue solely related to education. To highlight this need for an interdepartmental approach to this problem of violence in schools, I would like to place on record the wonderful work that is happening in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My last example of first-hand information is young Jimmy. I first came in contact with him in grade 3. He had serious problems&mdash;sadistic behaviour from an early age. He used to feed kittens to his german shepherd to get his kicks. He delighted in hurting young people and girls. We fought in vain to involve the necessary support personnel in Jimmy's case but there always seemed to be someone with a more pressing need. Jimmy stabbed his mother to death and was sentenced to life imprisonment at the age of 17. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the inquiry the committee constantly heard about the need for early intervention and support for families so that they could deal with the problem of violence in schools. I welcome the government's very supportive and constructive response to the recommendations concerning the piloting of positive parenting programs and the examination of the manner in which government services are delivered to students and families requiring support from more than one agency. The development by state and territory governments of a youth strategy coordinating committee is welcome news. However, one hopes and prays that there will be more benefits flowing from this committee than from the youth affairs departments which each state has&mdash;usually attached to the Premier's office&mdash;and which were supposedly set up to monitor such issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the role of the Commonwealth in the students at risk program as being one of the examples of the government's involvement in initiatives which support issues raised by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> report. My only criticism of the students at risk program is that it is far too late. I want to see the program widened and supported financially by the states so that it can be introduced to primary schools, where, by supporting school based programs, the number of young children leaving primary schools while they are still at risk can be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out the role of the media in this situation. Less sensationalist and more investigative journalism is needed to promote the best practice that is happening around our country. I cite two examples from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 1 March in its reporting of the government's response. The headline says `Tackling teacher abuse'. One gets a totally incorrect idea from a quick glance at that headline. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> has another headline saying `Call for more resources for problem students'. It can be seen that the whole issue of journalists getting involved needs to be looked at. </PARA>

The committee which worked on this report was a very positive and friendly committee, and it was bipartisan in the way it approached each of the topics that it met during the course of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I have some reservations about the government's response, and I will deal with those reservations. From the outset, I must say that one of the early disappointments was the way in which the government glossed over the connection between violence and bullying. It is very important that this difference is noted. The committee was able to differentiate, as it moved around Australia, that bullying is becoming more prevalent and that overt violence, if anything, is becoming somewhat less prevalent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, while acts of overt physical violence are rare events in most schools, bullying is prevalent. Australian research found that one child in seven reports being bullied at least once a week by other children at school. While the distribution of bullying amongst schools is uneven, in some schools it is as high as one in four. That information is contained in an extract from the report of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the incidence of overt violence seems to be on the decrease, at least within the schoolyard. The committee found evidence of overt violence outside the schoolyard, but it also found that bullying is a much more profound occurrence, and, in a way, it is much more insidious. This point was made to the committee by the New South Wales Teachers Federation, which pointed out that, in three-quarters of a million students, there are only 50 to 100 incidents of actual physical violence per semester. Although that would not appear to be a big problem, bullying is prevalent across the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Committee on Violence, in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Violence: Directions for Australia</EMPHASIS>, said it agreed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are disciplinary problems within many schools and that there are offences of various kinds and degrees of seriousness committed in and around schools, but that they are not necessarily cause for alarm or for vigorous reaction.</PARA>
<PARA>So, at this point, we need to move on to where we feel the distinction lies. This is where the bulk of the work must be concentrated&mdash;at that fine point between violence and bullying. In our report, we defined bullying as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . repeated and unprovoked negative behaviour (both physical and non-physical) directed by more powerful students or groups of students against less powerful students.</PARA>
<PARA>However, we went on to say that what seemed to affect the extent to which bullying occurred was the extent to which school staff were involved in the students' lives. Here we discovered quite a distinction as between schools and I believe this distinction revolved around how well the holistic school approach was applied to student behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach needs to include a number of major elements which we listed in our report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the provision of a caring environment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the establishment of firm behaviour limits where students' rights and responsibilities were clearly stated;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the implementation of fair and consistent sanctions when rules are transgressed;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. monitoring of children's behaviour both in the classroom and playground;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the adoption of a method of `mediating' poor student behaviour;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. training of staff in `mediation'; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the encouragement of parental involvement in their children's lives.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that two of the best schools we found in that regard had invoked all or most of those particular key points. It is also interesting that my colleague opposite, the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith), is here because we found that the Mayfield Primary School in Launceston was one of the best examples, among primary schools, of the adoption of that school regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting aspect of this, which was touched on by other speakers earlier in the debate, was the quality of leadership within the school. We found that in Mayfield&mdash;as we did at the next school I wish to refer to, which is the Patrician Brothers High School at Granville in the western suburbs of Sydney. This old school is not unlike the ones we used to see in the old English films&mdash;the two- or three-storey brick schools surrounded by asphalt courtyards with very little in the way of sporting facilities. The school is in what you would have to describe charitably as one of the more depressed parts of the western suburbs of Sydney, 76 per cent of the students come from ethnic backgrounds, and yet it was arguably the best school we came across in our study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the reason was that these key pointers we identified were largely invoked in that school. For example, one of the requirements of a teacher being on the staff was that he or she&mdash;be they religious or lay teachers&mdash;had to participate in the pastoral care of the students. There was a regime of respect&mdash;this idea of privilege and responsibility&mdash;and that was demonstrated very clearly in a rule that the school had invoked. That was that there was to be no touching of another student, other than at contact sport. In other words, everyone had to respect everyone else's space. There was also a great sense of family both within the school and with the involvement of the students' families from outside the school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have never been a great believer in corporal punishment, I never go to the extent of saying that we should deny all schools in all circumstances the right to administer limited corporal punishment. Although corporal punishment was not administered in this school very often, when I questioned a group of 29 students I asked the worst boy how often he would be punished by the strap. He said, `Perhaps two or three times a year.' People would hardly say that that was a violent atmosphere in that school. Interestingly, it put an ultimate sanction into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes, in this age of anti-corporal punishment, we have gone too far to the other end of the spectrum in allowing teachers or principals to exercise a right which may prevent worse behavioural problems. If the right to administer corporal punishment came from the degree of control, happiness and general wellbeing that was in a school, then this principal earned the right to administer it because he certainly had a school which, against all odds, was a great example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on to the government's response to the committee's recommendations, notably that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in conjunction with the state and territory ministers, find an evaluation of successful approaches which might lead to best practice, the government has said that it would set up a steering committee for the dissemination of results in this field and that it might consider an award system for schools that show leadership. I commend that particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also acknowledged our recommendation that the minister, in conjunction with his state and territory ministerial colleagues, develop a school violence data collection system&mdash;I am paraphrasing the recommendation. I do not have any hang-ups about this and about privacy. It is just raw data. The minister has delegated that to the statistics task force of the ministerial council, the MCEETYA. We also had the recommendation that the minister, with his state and federal colleagues, look at early intervention strategies to address violence and anti-social behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we worked through the ministerial responses, I had a feeling, as a previous speaker mentioned, that while the government was sensitive to the committee's needs in theory, there was not much happening in practice. Again, it was referred to a ministerial council, and to the committee, saying that it was to reassess the level of Commonwealth recurrent funding to government primary schools. If the government set up this inquiry, gave this committee a reference and went broad-ranging across all of Australia, it could not hide its response in the great litany of programs, many of them most commendable, that are in the addendum to its response on the one hand, nor can it say that it is going to fix it up by a series of ministerial councils. It is going to have to have some hard edged contribution from the Commonwealth. That may mean some form of direct government funding or funding through ministerial councils for specific projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not satisfied with the government's response to effects of television, video film, video games, et cetera, on learning outcomes and behaviour. The fact that there is an overlap between the Department of Communications and the Arts and the Department of Employment, Education and Training is not a sound basis for stepping away from this problem. Did we not all last Sunday hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) say, with his new-found zeal for a fourth family television channel, that the current fare being dished up to families was largely&mdash;and I use his own words&mdash;`American bilge'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Department of Employment, Education and Training must take an interest in these matters. We have had all sorts of inquiries into television, videos and video games. We sit on the edge of the information superhighway, and we turn around and duck the issue</PARA>
<PARA>on the most fundamental level of all entertainment: its effect on children and the spin-offs it has on the children's behaviour and educational outcomes. If we duck this particular issue, we are kidding ourselves. During our inquiry there was a lot of anecdotal evidence, at least, to point to a need for greater attention to that field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me, I would like to touch for a few moments on the link between violence and educational outcomes. The government has said in its report that it believes the causes of violence in schools are many and varied, and it notes that any causal links between literacy and violence are not well established. I do not think that that is a fair assessment. There may not have been many great causal links between smoking and lung cancer, initially, but there was a lot of anecdotal evidence that should have been acted on. I think this holds true here, because further on in the report, where the government quotes the Star program, it goes on to say that the improvement of basic literacy, numeracy and social skills necessary for students to function in society, raising their self-esteem and skills for coping with conflict and aggression, was an essential feature. But the government cannot say, on the one hand, that there is no causal effect, and then quote its own Star program saying that there is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise today to speak to this House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report on violence in schools called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS>, and also to speak to the government response to that report. As my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), has said, I was also part of that inquiry. Along with my colleagues, I wish to offer my appreciation to all of those who participated in any way in this report. It was not only those members of this government and those opposite who participated in bringing down this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> report: various groups, organisations, schools and children participated, and it is already proving to be a valuable document due to the information that was gathered and the recommendations that it proffered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our schools must be able to provide a safe learning environment for our children. That environment must be a caring environment, an environment that establishes firm behavioural limits, where students' rights are clearly demonstrated and their responsibilities are clearly stated. There must be sanctions when rules are transgressed, monitoring of children's behaviour in the classroom and in the playground, and a variety of other measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not automatically assume that schools are either safe or unsafe, and it is by proceeding with inquiries such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> inquiry that we can assure our children and their parents that the school environment will be safe and conducive to the learning process. The media, in its reporting of often very singular and isolated incidents, has often blown this issue out of all proportion, and has perhaps contributed to the community perception that our education system is violent or chaotic. We need to consider that perhaps schools reflect the behaviour patterns of our society, the society in which they are located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the deliberation of the committee, it was found that there are many schools where the principals have shown, and are showing, strong leadership&mdash;especially in those instances where there has been recognition that violent behaviour can be changed. These schools have developed a whole school approach to addressing school violence, alongside ensuring that their students are very much aware of their rights. Major importance has been placed on students taking responsibility for themselves and others, as well as on teachers taking their responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to focus on two particular recommendations and the government response to those. The committee recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in consultation with State and Territory Ministers for Education, fund the evaluation of successful approaches adopted by schools to determine best practice; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the result of that evaluation be published and disseminated.</PARA>
<PARA>As we conducted our inquiry, it became quite evident that there were schools operating under a best practice system with a whole school approach&mdash;in particular, when dealing with violence in the school environment. I will take the time to quote part of the report itself. The honourable member for Hinkler, who spoke previously, mentioned the Mayfield School in my electorate of Bass. When we visited Mayfield, the committee did so with my encouragement, as the school had not proffered a submission; but I knew what was going on there from close contact with that school, and I was determined that the inquiry and the committee should see that there was a program in place where a whole school approach had been taken to look at this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mayfield Primary School drew its student population from family situations where 70 per cent of parents were unemployed. Mayfield is a very depressed suburb of Launceston in many ways&mdash;and, I might add, a suburb where I spent a couple of years of my own life. As recently as four years ago, the playground of that school was considered unsafe. The introduction of the supportive school environment approach eliminated these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program which operated in the school was not an isolated program but an integral part of every aspect of school life. There was recognition by the principal and teachers that violent behaviour could be changed, and their dedication to effecting that change largely contributed to the turnaround in behaviour which the school experienced. The program endeavoured to promote the wellbeing of all those who worked within the school community. Throughout the program, children in particular learnt skills in behaviour management and conflict resolution. Students learned mutual respect and cooperation. Students in year 6 provided guidance and support for younger pupils, and all students were responsible for observing and reporting incidents which were contrary to the philosophy of the school. By being successful, children gained confidence and felt positive about themselves and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The school had developed a clear set of rights, as well as of responsibilities. These were developed between the teachers, pupils and parents, and were considered to be owned by the whole school community. The school developed rules that related to learning, movement, treatment, problem solving, safety, and talking and communication. While there was concern about the lack of resources, the environment in the school was improved immeasurably&mdash;without the allocation of additional resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This school had clearly stated consequences for behaviour. These consequences were positive for positive behaviour, and negative for inappropriate behaviour. The rules were also applied consistently. In all academic streams, the children were taught appropriate behaviour as an integral part of the teaching process. As an ex-schoolteacher, I know that has been the philosophy in my life: we need guidelines for our young people so that they know what the parameters of behaviour are. They also need to know that they may have to pay some price if they overstep those parameters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response has been for the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) to seek the cooperation of state and territory ministers and non-government systems to hold a series of forums to certify and identify the best in practice in whole school approaches to address violence in schools around Australia. This is a very appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Hinkler said, the government also hopes to establish a national mechanism for evaluating and disseminating the results of those discussions. This can only help and benefit those who look after our children in school hours. There is also to be an investigation into establishing a cooperative best practice award for schools. This would be something to display for leadership in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also keen to note that principals, teachers and community groups identified violence via the media, film, video games and negative modelling. That was one that came in quite unawares to the committee. In particular, via the media, a lot of negative modelling from some of the negative behaviour of our sports heroes has influenced how children react. I am sure we are all aware of that. They see their peers and their role models doing something and they think it is okay for them to do it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also accepted that the media and entertainment industries were out of the control of the schools. It was hoped that parents could and would exercise control over the programs and video games that their children watch and play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the second recommendation that I would like to focus on deals with the media and entertainment side of violence that is seen in our schools. The committee recommends that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) commission a national research project to examine the effects of television, video, film and video games on the learning outcomes and behaviour of Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this part of the argument, we cannot ignore the influence of parents and the extended family on student behaviour. Therefore, it is essential for the government to respond to the needs of families. All children should receive the necessary support to provide a safer and non-violent school environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was evidence of violence by the media throughout the committee's deliberations. It is stated vehemently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The influence exerted on children by the media and entertainment industry in general, was overwhelmingly identified in evidence as a contributor to the acceptance of, and the use of, violence by children.</PARA>
<PARA>Children do not distinguish between violence outside the school and violence inside the school environment. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence from the Australian Children's Television Action Committee stated that on average, by the time an Australian child was fourteen or sixteen years old he or she would have seen some eighteen thousand murders on television.</PARA>
<PARA>This is quite alarming. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They referred to three thousand studies which identified a connection between the impact of media violence and the instigation of later violence.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, you must agree that is damning evidence of the control that some media may have over our children's future lives. It is not only in that type of movie or video that children gather violent behaviours. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, teachers also referred to changed playground behaviours, such as kicking and punching by primary pupils, which coincided with the televising of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA>I have evidence of that in two nephews whose behaviour changed quite violently after having watched that particular program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, television series such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Neighbours</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home and Away</EMPHASIS> were identified as programs providing questionable role models for children developing social values and models for future behaviour. These programs were watched by children from six upwards. As G-classified programs they did not require parental supervision but, while not explicitly violent, they modelled belligerent attitudes and showed little respect for important values which children were learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To counter the effects of programs such as these, the council argued for two levels of G-rated programs, one for adolescents and one for six- to 12-year-old children. It is interesting to note that so many people and so many groups identify media as having some influence on the violence of children. That is not necessarily just in the school environment, although it does manifest there in particular, as we found in this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the government's response it was agreed that there was some concern that the media and entertainment industries have a clear responsibility to discourage the production of material which promotes violent and aggressive behaviour and attitudes. Processes to disseminate results of findings in this area to organisations such as school parent bodies will be a focus of the government's response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The communications and arts portfolio is already acting to safeguard the wellbeing of children in relation to media content, as well as the broadcasting services through the Broadcasting Services Act 1992; and committee members, along with other interested members, groups and organisations, will keep a watchful eye on all research projects and processes in place now, to ensure that wherever possible children are not subjected to undue violence and harmful material via films, media, video games and even advertising material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report must be looked at by everyone. I am pleased to say that within my own electorate many schools have asked for copies of this report so they can look at our findings, look at our recommendations and develop whole school approaches and best principles for looking at violence within their schools. I support the motion that the House take note of the paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the report on violence in schools. I speak as a member of the education, employment and training committee, even though coming in a little later, not initially being a member of that committee for that inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First I would like to say a few words about the history of our schooling system over the last 20 or 25 years, in my experience of it. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, are a former teacher and many former teachers bring their professional background and their understanding of educational issues into the parliament. I bring a somewhat different perspective, as someone who experienced the education system for only about 10 years of my life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in my early adult experience of the education systems, as my children were growing up, I became aware that the education system had approximately a doubling of the resources in the early 1970s and a doubling of the staffing, as the government of the day saw that as a priority. I guess the promise in those times was that, if we could put more resources into education, we would reap a reward. Looking back over that 20- to 25-year period, however, at best we could say that the results were mixed. I offer one statistic&mdash;the youth unemployment statistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might look back over the last few years and say that there are certain areas where the resources are limited and where resources have been reduced. But if we look at the span of history, especially over the last 20 or 30 years, we find that there has been a very significant taxpayer contribution to education. I have to say that some of the social issues around that expenditure bear greater scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened in that time was we had the three Rs being taught in the general curriculum of the day, which was seen to be appropriate. Then we saw more social experimentation, if you like. We got into a range of extra activities and put greater burdens on schools. Sadly, at the same time, parents were left out in the cold. I make these comments in preface to my remarks on this report because I think we have to see the report, and where our schooling system is at, in the context not just of the last few years but of a generation or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, parents were left out in the cold. As time went on, those in the teaching profession found that the load got too heavy. Parents were important after all. Parents were not just nuisances to be sidelined and prevented from being involved in the lives&mdash;and, particularly, the education&mdash;of their children. The moral self-righteousness that not all but many teachers had in those early years of enthusiasm in the 1970s gave way to a greater realisation that it was a full team and full community approach, that there were, indeed, limitations to what the schools could achieve, and limitations to the role of our teachers, that schools should not just be a social experiment, and that families were important in the overall situation. Gradually, as time has gone on, there has been a lesser expectation of what schools can achieve and of their role in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of South Australia, the dear old South Australian Institute of Teachers will always campaign against anything Liberal, and I understand that. That is the traditional line-up of the political equation. But, in that process, we must be very careful that our schools, as much as possible, be apolitical. Our schools should not be involved too much in what is deigned to be `politically correct' from a particular perspective. There should not be excessive denigration and ridicule of a person's value judgments, religious beliefs or, indeed, political beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The atmosphere of a greater political tolerance that I hope might be emerging in our education system brings us to the topic of the day&mdash;the violence in schools report and the government's response. Violence in schools is, of course, only indicative of the greater violence in the wider community. Children are great mimics. We must remember this when forming any anti-violence policies for children. We must remember that children are just reflecting what they see around them, and they are highly influenced by family, friends, television and other segments of society. In that, of course, we must include the education system, their teachers and their friends and peers at school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things which this committee found was that there is a lack of concrete evidence about the level of violence and bullying in schools, and a lack of research on the effects of television and media violence. That is a great pity, because it makes it that much harder to formulate policy. Therefore, the committee has recommended that further research and data needs to be collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Bass (Ms Sylvia Smith), made the point that I was going to make about the 18,000 murders that children may view on television in their first 14 or 16 years of life. If it were not for television and other forms of entertainment, how much experience of murders would children have? Of course, we would all say, `Very little or none, except perhaps some information from books and newspapers.' Therefore, clearly, television and movies have a very significant influence on bringing the world of violence into the homes of children. It is that casual exposure that, after a while, we need to understand far more, as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made some comments about a family TV channel, and maybe the idea has some worthy notions around it. It appears that his idea is called highly impractical, inherently unlikely, and ill-thought through. Be that as it may, the Prime Minister makes a reasonable point that the exposure of the family and of young children to these sorts of programs is something that the nation should be more aware of. We cannot have a slapdash solution thrown at the level of violence which children see through the media, and this is why the committee believes that substantial research should take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, my home state newspaper, discussed a national survey on how TV influences children in the United States. More than two-thirds of the 10- to 16-year-olds interviewed claimed that they were influenced by television, and that this influence includes an increase in aggressive behaviour. Although I do not know how comprehensive the survey was, I believe it is time, and the committee believes it is time, that more work was done in Australia on this issue. In the state of South Australia, extensive research has been done on the subject of school bullying. I am currently involved with another inquiry which will expose more about the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents, of course, are concerned about the level of violence on television, particularly violence in cartoons and in daytime programs which are especially for children. Violent programs often have their own line of merchandise in toy stores, allowing young children to dress up as their heroes and to re-enact the violent behaviour they have seen on television. Children are simply being exploited in the violence industry, and parents cannot constantly monitor what their children are watching. There is a role for parents to play, and they should be involved to a greater extent and have a greater input into film classifications</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come to the question of what governments can do. In my earlier comments I touched on the span of history over the last 20 to 25 years. The index shows that we have expended a significant amount of resource into our education system. The previous speaker, the member for Bass, mentioned a school in her electorate which the committee visited. Although I was not able to be involved at that time, I make the point that the committee found that extra funding does not necessarily ensure the success of an anti-violence campaign in schools. The point which I make with reference to that particular school in Tasmania is that a successful anti-violence campaign was put into place without extra funding. It is an issue, but, as the report and the response acknowledges, it is not extreme. However, it is something that we need to understand more about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of Austudy is raised in the report. I support the comments of the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) when he said that there is a need for greater recognition of the problems in regional Australia. Regional Australia is going through massive adjustment&mdash;more so, I suggest, than most of metropolitan Australia. The people who live in regional Australia are primarily less well-off than people in the metropolitan areas of our country, and I represent one of the electorates in regional Australia. Access to education represents the main opportunity for the people who live in regional Australia to break out of the very severe adjustment process that has been going on out there over the last decade or so. We must, in the Austudy situation, recognise the extra costs and the pressures which these people have. It is now clearly recognised by almost everybody that rural students are the most disadvantaged of all students when it comes to accessing tertiary studies. I believe that the general issue of violence is very much tied up with the necessity for a broader educational understanding of the issue and in giving people greater opportunities. The regional Australian needs to be recognised much more so than was the case in the past. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TV question is certainly one that we need to be conscious of. A lot of violence&mdash;a lot of murders&mdash;is shown on TV, including in ongoing TV programs. We need to be conscious of the quality of those TV programs. There were murders before TV and you cannot just draw the conclusion that TV causes all the problems. The committee did try to have a look at that, but I do not think there is any research that actually ties that together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations of the committee was that there probably needs to be a reference, some time in the future, for work to be done in that area. That is very true. It is about quality TV, and I despair a bit in relation to that when I think about all the new channels that might start to enter homes in the future. The quality of all that cable TV could be something that we as a parliament will need to deal with in the future. I think there will be a lot of junk on it and it will come back. I was quite heartened by being able, on another committee, to visit the Australian Children's Television Foundation and see the work that it does in children's programming in this country. That is an excellent foundation, which needs support constantly to continue its good work and to lift the standard of children's TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> is the report of a wide-reaching and detailed study of violence in schools and the possible causes and effects, with thoughts on what could be achieved if changes could be made. This government has welcomed the report brought down by the committee, because it has raised the profile of the problem of violence in the schools and the nature of that violence, and will seek state and territory cooperation in developing a national approach in addressing this difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we saw in some of the visits the committee made around the country, there are solutions being developed and there are mechanisms in some places that more than address much of the problems of violence and disruption that takes place in the schools. These need to be shared and to be taken out into the broader context of every state and territory. I look forward to hearing more of how that comes out of a state/territory-federal government committee process. But there were also places in which an enormous amount of work needs to be done and I am pleased to see that this government is prepared to pick up most of the recommendations from the committee, including a number of very positive parental programs as recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed in the comments that it had not been established that there was a causal link between literacy and violence and therefore there was no link. I think that was a little short-sighted. For sure, if people cannot read and write it does not mean that they are, by definition, violent people, but an inability to communicate, on top of all the other frustrations that life can offer, must lead to expression in other ways. That can mean aggression, diversion, evasion and, if none of those work, violence. We need only to look as far as our gaols to see how many people in there have low literacy skills&mdash;a very high percentage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Illiteracy thus is not a cause of violence but an expression of the causes, which may include such things as violence or assault at home, loss of self-esteem, hopelessness, lack of achievement, lack of parental assistance or understanding&mdash;so many things can contribute to a young person not being able to pick up essential skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy that the government has responded to the fact that literacy is a problem. There is to be research funding that will investigate how literacy development can be encouraged in the home and the school, and how to deliver that encouragement. There will also be an investigation of different approaches to overcome literacy problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot stress strongly enough how important literacy is to an individual. The inability to read and write can be very easily passed through generations if there is no-one in a family who believes in the importance of literacy. Some families only have newspapers and magazines in their homes because their skills are limited. How are their children to go on and understand the need for greater skills in reading and interpreting the written word?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently participated in a seminar on youth suicide in my electorate that was set up to learn why so many young people, particularly adolescent boys, had found it necessary to harm themselves or kill themselves. This finding had come out of a study in Tasmania. I have also been reading in the press about how girls are now becoming the high achievers in schools, which is adding to the pressure on young males. We, as a society, are putting pressure on our children that can be so untenable that they can only see the `final' solution&mdash;the bottle of barbiturates or the end of a gun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the 1960s, our communities have moved so quickly. Technology is allowing us more time to consider such issues as the environment.

We were full of doom and gloom: the world would definitely end if we did not do something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the thing is that we did do something, and things have improved considerably since those days. Although some of us are still marching on some of those issues, each day something advances the environmental cause so that there is hope, there is change, and there is considerable improvement. What we have forgotten to do is tell our children. They do not believe that anything positive has happened. They still believe the world is about to end and they are hard pushed to do anything about it. They have not had the experience that we have had and cannot see the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same in education. Our understanding of the need for flexibility and adaptability, and not to be frightened by change or technology, is gradually occurring. But our kids still do not seem to understand the value of education. It is still too hard to find a job, so they say, `Why should we bother to learn?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Violence in schools has a base in many paradigms that face our young people every day. How do we equip them better? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still believe that there needs to be an enormous change in the learning process. Teaching must become a communal process. Children should learn that participation in the learning process gives them certain responsibilities and challenges, but that there is a lot of hope and excitement in meeting them and there is a meaningful life after school&mdash;even if it does not mean full-time work in a traditional job. Our job as parents and teachers is to make sure that the message gets through. I believe that this report and the government's response to it helps us greatly in moving along the way to achieving a rewarding life for most of our youngsters. </PARA>

I found that in just about every school that I have looked at: where there is good leadership and good support from the community and from parents, you will find good support and a good achievement rate. I look forward to the recommendations that the government has undertaken to implement, and to following those through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate and I would firstly like to acknowledge the opportunity that is provided by these take note debates in this chamber. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and I are both members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and we were signatories to a minority report on the Main Committee in which we indicated a number of concerns about how this may operate. We still have a number of concerns about aspects of it, in particular about the fact that, apart from occasional visits, there never appear to be instances where ministers are available to sum up the debate. I would have thought that that would have been very important in ensuring that the Main Committee enjoys an equal standing&mdash;or, if not equal, certainly a very high standing&mdash;as the second chamber of the House of Representatives. So I indicate the concern that a number of us have with that particular aspect of the conduct of this committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But other than that, the take note debates do provide members of the House with a tremendous opportunity to debate in more detail those reports that are tabled in the House and&mdash;as the member opposite, the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) has indicated&mdash;the government responses to those reports in a way that, until the creation of the second chamber, was very rarely possible. This is a tremendous opportunity, particularly for backbenchers, to represent the views of their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the reports we are referring to today&mdash;the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on violence in Australian schools, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> report, and the government's response to it&mdash;I would like to make a couple of opening remarks. First of all, bullying and violence in school is nothing new. In fact, those who have taken an interest in literature, particularly some of the literature of the 19th century, would know that bullying and that type of violence was quite endemic in some schools. This was particularly so in the United Kingdom where the public school system was in full force. One looks back at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tom Brown's Schooldays</EMPHASIS> and other similar works which describe a situation where bullying was an integral part of what was a very brutal and unpleasant schooling system, something which the author of that work was very keen to reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in the first instance, we are dealing with something that has been going on ever since there have been schools and, in particular&mdash;because it happens to be a predominantly male problem&mdash;in schools with males in them. Of course, I acknowledge that it is a matter that affects both genders, but it particularly has been in the past, and I imagine it is predominantly now a problem among male students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Commonwealth taking an interest in this problem area, there are a number of issues that relate to the Commonwealth's role in the education system. When the member for Fremantle and Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was minister for education in the Western Australian government, she made a particularly pertinent comment about going to a conference on education in Darwin. She made the comment that, on arrival, she found herself in the position where she was educating hundreds of thousands of students in the Western Australian education system and had three or four advisers with her from her department, while the Commonwealth minister, who educated no students whatsoever, fronted up with about 20 advisers. It was an interesting comment, coming from someone who is now a Commonwealth minister, because it reflects somewhat the attempts by the Commonwealth to make inroads into areas which are essentially state jurisdiction&mdash;quite substantially so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having read the report and the government's response, I believe that there are a number of areas in which the Commonwealth can provide quite handy assistance. In particular&mdash;and I intend to go through the recommendations shortly&mdash;the key areas are: collation of information, which obviously the states are not in a position to do on a national basis; and the compilation of that type of information and research, et cetera that is likely to be of assistance to those charged with the responsibility for administering education systems within the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it somewhat of a contradiction in terms to look at the Commonwealth government's response to the report on page 3 where it states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we were interrupted, I was referring to page 3 of the government's response. I agree entirely with the committee's finding, and I am pleased to see that the then chairman of the committee, the member for Forde is actually in the chamber. The response says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also fully endorses the proposition put by the Committee that it is the right combination of action at the school level that can have the most effective impact on addressing violence in our schools. The Committee found that strong leadership by the principal and the teachers working together on the basis of a whole school approach to addressing school level violence has proven to be most effective in achieving changes in student behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that entirely, and add that I think it is in fact in the devolution of the administration of schools that we will see a greater level of that grassroots evolution of the whole school approach. I believe that it is when you have the imposition or overlay of central policy decisions or programs that one tends to see the distancing or the separation of that grassroots level of school life and, of course, the objectives that pertain to this particular report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own case, I am the elected member for the fastest growing area in the country, with the city of Wanneroo being the fastest growing municipality, outstripping the shire of Albert and having a growth rate of around 12,000 in population per annum, so it is a particularly large and growing area. According to the statistics that are provided from time to time to us as members, the area has the greatest concentration of five- to 15-year-olds in the country. Ironically, it also has the greatest concentration of four-bedroom homes, which tends to suggest that this is an area where there are larger families than perhaps there are elsewhere, with children of between five and 15 years of age&mdash;with all the responsibility, cares and concerns that parents have in relation to their children's schooling. That is what makes the discussion of the issues arising from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> report of great note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a policeman for nine years before I became a member of parliament, and I can say that the question of bullying at school and violence at school is a very difficult one indeed, particularly in relation to the investigation of particular offences and the treatment of complaints where people have been assaulted. How does one treat a complaint? How does one have the matter dealt with? Is it dealt with in school, or is it something that ought to be automatically dealt with by the police or other authority?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lyons (Mr Adams), who spoke before me, made the most telling comment that it is a matter of leadership, in particular on the part of the principal, the teachers of the school and, in conjunction with them, the parents. I note that particular remark and agree with it wholeheartedly. Within my particular electorate, with well over 66 schools&mdash;and I am talking about major schools&mdash;I have found time and time again that where there is good leadership in the school the management of these particular problems tends to be much more effective. Particularly effective is a cooperative leadership among the staff, the principal, the parents and, to a certain extent, the students themselves. A grassroots, whole school approach is required in the context of this problem of violence in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take a great interest in schools. I have a youth policy advisory committee, which meets monthly and comprises students from years 10, 11 and 12 at the schools, in my area. I have been running that now for five years since becoming the member for Moore, and I have always been very interested at the beginning of each year in putting together the issues which the students think are of most concern to them. We have a straw poll whereby we elicit the types of issues that they and their peers feel most strongly about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of the five years, the question of violence in school has never really arisen, and that somewhat surprises me when I read the report and some of the evidence of the submissions that were received by the committee. That is not to say that it is not a problem; I am just saying that the people on the committee that I run&mdash;and I take the trouble to canvass their views&mdash;have not once indicated that violence is a particular problem. They have indicated, however, that juvenile crime is a problem, and I think that there is a convergence between the problems of violence and juvenile crime. We know from the evidence around us in the community that the two groups most heavily affected by violence in the community are the young and the aged. In the case of the young, more often than not the violence is perpetrated by one of their own. So it is, I suppose, a peer problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not entirely sure whether it was identified in the report itself&mdash;I think there was some mention of penalties&mdash;that penalties in relation to violence, and particularly in relation to assaults, have lagged somewhat. It seems that assaults clearly deserve more stringent and substantial punishment. Because of a decline around the country in punishment being meted out, it seems that people have felt less constrained, less fearful, about the prospects of being detected and then punished as a consequence of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult for schoolteachers these days, and I have a great deal of sympathy for many of them in their job. It is a very difficult role to play in this day and age because of the limited sanctions available to them to be able to deal with a very difficult problem. Mostly it is a problem that involves a very small minority and, as my own students in their committee identified, it is often a small recidivist group&mdash;to use a term that is perhaps a current one&mdash;who re-offend or commit the same offences over and over again. The students on my committee were very concerned about the unfortunate image young people have of being law-breakers, violent, or in some way less socially responsible. It is an unfortunate image because in 99 per cent of cases that is not the case. In newspapers and on television, we get to see only the extreme examples where some youngsters are identified as being problems to their local community with their antisocial behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report, there is talk in the government's response about the problems associated with computer games and violence on television. There is clear evidence for this. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) talked about causal effects. There is a very strong causal link between violence on television, in computer games and the young. There is a general ambience of violence in the community these days because of those particular media. There is clear-cut evidence that it affects adults and there is evidence that the young are affected too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in computer games extended to warning the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in relation to his own inquiry and the legislation in relation to computer games, especially violent computer games. There are a number of loopholes within the legislation that would allow particular types of games&mdash;for instance, games with extremely unpleasant sound tracks&mdash;to slip through the legislation. I am very concerned about that. In particular, I am concerned that the Internet&mdash;this vast new information superhighway, as I think it is somewhat wrongly called&mdash;provides an opportunity for young people to have access to a free exchange of violent computer games or other material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I endorse the areas where the Commonwealth can have a role in education, compilation of statistics and other useful information on a national stage. I do not believe the Commonwealth has a particular role to play in the imposition of programs at the school and state level. I think it is to the Commonwealth's advantage to be an assisting and cooperating influence with the states to ensure that the problem of violence and bullying in schools is overcome. I look forward to the days when my children no longer come home and tell me about instances of bullying and that type of standover-type behaviour in our Australian schools. </PARA>

As a general rule, society needs to express how intolerable violence is to it.

But one needs to have some inner strength to be able to stand up to the mob.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My message is that it is an attitude. I will put that in the context of the government's role as referred to by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) in his summation. I think his suggestion that the Commonwealth does not have a role in specific programs has failed. I do not say this with any party political basis; I do it on a personal basis. I concede and bow to the honourable member for Moore's experience of police matters, since he worked for nine years in that job. I worked for 12 years in education as a librarian. I also went to both public and private schools for my schooling, in a heavily ethnic area. I saw the violence first-hand as a young male growing up in a school that was strictly split into four different groups. To be able to go through and mix with all of those groups, to stand up and say something against the violence and violent interaction, is a very hard thing to do. For young Australians in our schools to have the guts to stand up and say, when a fight is beginning to emerge in the playground, `Don't be stupid; pull your head in' there needs to be a backup from the staff and the rest of the pupils in that school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attitude as a teacher when a fight erupted was to go in and collar the lot.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Moore, as a former police officer, would understand that his job was only as good as the people who were around him. The community has to be behind him. That is what he referred to and I fully agree with his comments about parents and the broader community being involved. However, what I suggest&mdash;and that is what the government report seems to be hoping for&mdash;is an attitudinal change. When people incite racism for political purposes, or use ethnic groups in a political way to score points, or when people can or cannot speak about something because of fear of racism, I think the whole community, starting with politicians should not callously use those arguments and jump on those bandwagons. </PARA>

When those opposite talk about violence and talk about keeping violence out of schools, I would suggest that what they should do is address the real issue. If they talk about leadership, their own behaviour should be involved. In terms of schools and violence, my experience at Wyrallah High School was that we had a whole staff of people who did everything that they could to promote an optimistic framework, but, as I first said, violence is a raw exertion of power.

I think there are many of us who believe that the level of temperature amongst those troops out there might have been such that it would be that way. I am not trying to assert that in any way, but if we exerted raw power that would have been a response such as comes from human beings and animals.

One would have imagined that that would be the case. It was not the case, because the attitude of the teaching staff there was one of caring and of being non-tolerant of intolerance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the Year of Tolerance, yes. But even if tolerance suggests that I have to tolerate fascist viewpoints I will not. I will speak out against them. I will do all I can to make sure that the other person has the right to express those views but I will not do anything to assist. I will not make media platforms for such people to stand on. I reflect back to the attitudes and the behaviour of us here in this House, because if it starts with anyone, anyone who wants to open their mouth on this subject, it starts with that person. That person should reflect on how they vote and how they talk up or talk down violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett, in Victoria, with a passionate plea to the Greek community, touched on something which I felt was extremely worrying in a country such as Australia. The debate about land bills and the divisions that we have just had in relation to the land fund bill, and the divisions that are projected because of that, do nothing for this nation. It is the community, the families that call themselves Australians, who should change the attitude. We lead through what we do. All of us should examine our own lives. </PARA>

I have taught in schools with Australians of all denominations and I have had the pleasure of the company and the pleasure of the insights that that can bring. We can look and count and go through the motions of describing and drawing a picture of this thing&mdash;violence in schools. But if we truly wish to do something about taking violence out of schools, we should do it by taking it out of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention two last things. I came in as a schoolteacher when canes were allowed to be used. I refused to use them. I had great difficulties in that environment getting through to students. When I asked one class, `What do I have to do to get you to work?' they called out in unison, `Cane us, sir. Cane us.' They were a product of the environment in which they lived. A lot of those teachers had a hell of a hard time when caning was taken away. But you do not respond to violence with violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Julius Chan has had the courage of his convictions in standing up and saying that capital punishment is not on. That man, I suggest, is showing leadership. If we want to look at leadership to take violence away from women, to take violence out of our relationships and our schools, then we look at our own attitudes. It starts with each and every one of us as individuals. I ask that, when we each responsibly put our metal to the earth, when we try to do our job, we do it with the conviction in our hearts that we will do that. Then we will change it. Then the government's response, be it with dollars or programs, will actually have some modicum of chance of winning. I thank the House. </PARA>
