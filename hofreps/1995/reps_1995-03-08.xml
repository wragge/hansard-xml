<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday evening, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples) addressed the House on the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994. As have various government speakers in the second stage of this very important debate, the member once again claimed that the opposition objects to this legislation, which we clearly do not. He said that our objections were premeditated and deliberate, and that we are antagonistic to the proposal to give Aboriginal land rights.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is more deception. In his address to the House last week, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) introduced this legislation, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made it absolutely clear. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not vote against the passage of this legislation in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. We do that on a number of strict understandings that I want to make clear from the very beginning.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state that the amendments previously passed by the Senate in the earlier legislation would be regarded as the basis for further changes when we come to government. He wanted to make it very clear that we would amend the legislation to bring it into line with what was resolved by the Senate. But the important point is this: as a consequence of the passage of this legislation, the Aboriginal community will not be denied the benefit of the land fund provisions. We accept that the inadequacies contained in this legislation will be addressed upon the change of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House that, under the circumstances, this is a statesmanlike and sensible approach to what has become difficult and contentious legislation. The government has used this legislation to divide the opposition from Aboriginal Australians. The government has attempted to use this legislation to paint the opposition as anti-Aboriginal and, in a sense, un-Australian. The point should be made that this legislation&mdash;that is, the second bill&mdash;in fact contains 29 of our earlier amendments. But I think it is also important to point out that, while that is some improvement, it is not enough. We believe that the government has simply not been prepared to address the fundamental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various speakers in the government have referred to the extraordinary level of consultation which it is claimed the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) entered into on behalf of the government with Aboriginal land councils and Aboriginal communities. Our shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), consulted with Aboriginals across Australia and, on that basis, I do not have the slightest doubt that she was surprised at the number of Aboriginal communities and leading Aboriginals who claim they were not consulted by the government at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question which we put to this House when the initial legislation came forward was to examine in detail our amendments and to regard them on their merits. But, within hours of our amendments being tabled, they were rejected out of hand by the Prime Minister and his minister. The government did not even bother to address the issues which we had raised. So much for its approach to a bipartisanship answer to one of the longest and most difficult social problems facing Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the amendments which we wanted to have the legislation contain, and which, as I said, were ignored by the government, addressed issues such as requiring the Indigenous Land Corporation to give priority to the `most severely dispossessed of their traditional lands' or to refer to that requirement in the legislation. The government refused to accept that very fundamental change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sought to provide that the ILC may grant land and money to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and trusts as well as corporate bodies or to refer to such grants in the legislation. Again, the government ignored that out of hand. We sought to require that, in the performance of its land acquisition functions, the ILC would take regard to health, housing, educational, economic, social and cultural needs of Aboriginal communities and of the members who make up those communities. Again, this was ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sought to require that the ILC would consult with traditional owners prior to acquiring land or making a grant to acquire land. That was a very important reform. Why? Because there are parcels of land in the various states of Australia, particularly Western Australia, which are held by Aboriginal communities or Aboriginal families on which other Aboriginal communities may themselves have claims under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a very sad day when the unity of purpose which this legislation is meant to be trying to establish would in fact divide Aboriginal communities from each other and have them arguing over land in this manner. So it is a very important issue, but again ignored by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly obvious that the government has talked to some people, but it is equally obvious that it has not talked to enough. As a former shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs back in the 1980s, I will refer to some of the issues which I think are important in this overall problem. I want to quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Walking together: the first steps</EMPHASIS> which is the report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to the federal parliament. It referred to the issue of land because the council, quite rightly, saw this as one of the key issues in the reconciliation process. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples&mdash;whether they live in cities, towns or the bush&mdash;their traditional and historical connection to land is central to their identity, community and sense of justice. The land is the centre of culture and spirit for Aboriginal peoples . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Successive generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples maintained their group identity and connection to land by respecting and continuing the names and activities of the Dreaming (the creation time) through stories, songs, dances and ceremonies . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Britain asserted sovereignty over the east coast of Australia in 1770, nearly all of the continent and many of its islands were owned and occupied by diverse indigenous groups. These groups lived by complex laws, practised various forms of land tenure and resource management and protected their traditional estates and sacred sites.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to draw the attention of the House specifically to the words `complex laws' and `practised various forms of land tenure and resource management'. I think there is a very real danger in a complex subject such as this to do one of two things. The first is to take the anthropological position as it may have been in place, say, 200 years ago and to try to apply that in the modern age. I think that can be a fundamental error. Secondly, it can be an error for an alien social system such as the British system to be applied holus-bolus to Aboriginal traditional cultural values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no denying the fact that Aboriginal Australians must be part of the mainstream of this nation. Their rights as Australian citizens, therefore, must be totally respected as are the rights of all other citizens, irrespective of from where they may come. The point I am making is that there are now in Australia significant numbers of Aboriginal people who are still living geographically within the confines of their traditional lands but whose social and occupational lifestyles are in many respects far removed from the land tenure systems in place 200 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give an example which was brought to my attention at Bourke when I was shadow minister. I studied the situation out there and, frankly, found it very distressing in many respects. What I also found very distressing was to meet a number of Aborigines who had made every possible attempt to uplift themselves and their families to become part of the mainstream of Australia while, at the same time, being totally committed to their Aboriginal traditions and cultural values. In a sense, they were a bridge between the conventional Aboriginal community and the modern Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that they wanted land but could not have it. Why couldn't they have it? It was because they did not have the political power in the local Aboriginal land council which was dominated by a number of families of which they were not members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The old story.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the old story. Unfortunately, in its effort to be all things to all men and all women, the government in this legislation has once again failed to address this critical social problem which goes to the very heart of some of the amendments which we put forward in the initial legislation. We are simply saying that in the granting of land title it cannot be presumed that all the various Aboriginal communities that we wish to support are made up of individuals who necessarily fit a given paradigm. As I said, in the case of Bourke that was simply not so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The young man I was talking to, and who reflected many others in his community, could not obtain land even though he was an Aboriginal. It was not the New South Wales government or the Commonwealth government that was preventing him having access; sadly and deliberately it was because he did not have sufficient political pull in his own community, and his family was not one of the families which dominated the local land council. Anybody who wants to be honest will face the fact that that type of problem is not unique. It is found, to varying degrees, in other parts of Australia as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely why one of the fundamental amendments which we wish to put forward, and which the Senate accepted&mdash;but ignored by the government&mdash;was the point that the ILC may grant land and money to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals and trusts, as well as to corporate bodies. That is to acknowledge the fact that communities and individuals in today's Australia cannot necessarily be forced into a convenient legal entity, in this case only corporate bodies, when there are many individuals who also want to own land in their own right. It is land traditional to their own culture and moieties, yet they have been effectively excluded by the weaknesses in the current land council system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing which has concerned me for some time in relation to this legislation is that the government has tended to present this land fund legislation in the context of the billion dollars to purchase land for Aboriginal communities which otherwise have been excluded from the benefits of the Mabo legislation. This is quite adequately covered in the outline in the explanatory memorandum to this legislation which makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to establish a Land Fund and an Indigenous Land Corporation to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to acquire and manage land in a way that will provide them with social, cultural and economic benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>On that point, there is no distinction between the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Labor Party. We are as one. But, as I pointed out, how we achieve those three excellent objectives purely in the context of a corporate body is what I and my colleagues believe the government has tended to ignore for far too long. We are also told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fund is being established in recognition of the fact that most indigenous people will not benefit from the High Court's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mabo (No. 2)</EMPHASIS> decision and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Native Title Act 1993</EMPHASIS> because they were dispossessed of their land and cannot therefore demonstrate the continuous association necessary to provide native title.</PARA>
<PARA>Over recent years, various state governments have also addressed this issue&mdash;some better than others, there is no doubt about that. But I would like the House to be aware of what was done in New South Wales under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983. That legislation, introduced by a Labor government and carried on by a Liberal-National Party government, transferred all reserves held by the Aboriginal Land Trust to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act allowed Aboriginal people to both claim and purchase land, and it created a system of land councils and provided for the equivalent of 7.5 per cent of all New South Wales lands tax revenue to be paid into a land council account. The total amount each year has varied from $51 million to $31 million. Since 1986 the act has required that 50 per cent of annual appropriations and all interest on investments must be accumulated in a statutory investment fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of all this is&mdash;as of 12 July 1993, which are the latest figures I have&mdash;that there was $263 million in the statutory investment accounts of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council fund, which includes the freehold land and building fund, the fixed interest fund and the building fund. That does not include accumulated interest. The other 50 per cent of the money is available to cover administration, most going to help set up the 113 local land councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am getting to is simply this: at no stage of the entire process am I aware that the government really addressed the fact that the issue of money for the purchase of land for Aboriginal communities is and, at the time, was being addressed by a number of state governments. We were told that the objective of this legislation was to give access, over time, to some $1 billion of taxpayers' money for the purchase of land. We were not told, as I have just pointed out, that, in the case of New South Wales alone, there was a further $263 million available for the same purpose. If you were to add up the funds available in the other states, it would probably come to not too far short of double the amount that the government is, in fact, proposing to spend under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point only because it is very easy for the government to try to present itself as the sole saviour on the issue of access by Aboriginal Australians to adequate land. The point I make is that additional funds are being provided through the states. I think it is sad for the taxpayers of Australia and the Aboriginal communities, who are ultimately meant to be the beneficiaries, that there has not been a closer interrelationship between the Commonwealth and the states to ensure that the land councils, whether they be under federal or state legislation, are able to work together, in as close a manner as possible, to ensure that the best possible outcomes are achieved for the people that this legislation is meant to help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental purpose of this legislation is to ensure that Aboriginal Australians are able to improve their situation, that their social and economic infrastructure is improved significantly and that the 40,764 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who require housing in rural and remote Australia are adequately attended to. They deserve housing the same as everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad and inescapable reflection on this government and on Aboriginal policy in this nation for far too long that, while you are now spending approximately $2 billion a year on Aboriginal welfare&mdash;a figure which has virtually doubled in the last 12 years that you have been in government&mdash;in housing, health and a whole range of areas where one can take statistics and compare them over time, the issues are still there. Solutions to the problems have not been found. Sadly, Aboriginal Australians and their children in their thousands are worse off today than they were over a decade ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Aboriginal rights and access to land represent Australia's oldest and most important social justice issue. No Australian, no member of this parliament, no member of our society&mdash;none of us&mdash;can talk with meaning about a fair and just Australia until this issue is resolved. None of us can be comfortable with Australia's claim to egalitarian values&mdash;a fair go for all&mdash;until Aboriginal Australians receive fair and sustained access to land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what makes this government's response to the High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2 so important. It confirms the legal fiction of terra nullius and recognises that native title still exists in Australia, provided the relevant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have maintained ties to the land in question and the title has not been extinguished by governmental action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, that is what makes the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill now before the House no less important. This bill confirms the need for a mechanism outside the Mabo ruling and Native Title Act by which land can be returned to Aboriginal ownership and recognises the need of the large number of indigenous Australians who, by the will of others, were dispossessed from their land and now cannot claim native title and justice under the Mabo provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This land fund is essential not only for the future of Aboriginal people in Australia but also for the concept of reconciliation about the past. It provides a fund and investment strategy from which Aboriginal people will derive ongoing opportunities to purchase land of economic and cultural significance. In one respect, it represents reparations of $1.5 billion over the next 10 years&mdash;reparation and compensation for the dispossession of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term aim is for the fund to be self-financing. It will allow the purchase on commercial grounds of significant Aboriginal sites and traditional land currently under freehold and leasehold title. The fund will be  important because it will provide and guarantee economic security for Aboriginal communities, as well as cultural security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a provision in the bill that land granted by the Indigenous Land Corporation to a community corporation cannot be resold without the consent of the ILC. An opposition amendment in the Senate to the original bill proposed unfettered resale of this land; that is, to turn Aboriginal communities into real estate agents. The opposition has ignored the essential point that, if the land is worth purchasing in the first place, it will not warrant sale in the future and is unlikely to be sold in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill provides land as an economic base to avoid the sort of welfare dependency that has been too much a feature of Aboriginal life in communities around the country. It aims to provide land as a cultural base to avoid the demoralisation and marginalisation of those communities. Its aim is to restore cultural pride and cultural standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this point, I refer the House to the citation of the 1995 Australian Community of the Year, which was awarded to the Jawoyn association on Australia Day earlier this year. It is an outstanding example of how a community&mdash;in this case, in the Northern Territory&mdash;having received access to land, can use that land for economic and cultural purposes. It has used the land successfully in mining agreements; it has used the tourism benefits of its management of national parks for economic security; and, out of that, and with the aspects of self-government and self-administration available to the Jawoyn association, it has been able to reduce the welfare dependency which had been an unhappy feature of its community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This example brings together, in my assessment, the three aspects of policy that need to be confirmed by this parliament in Aboriginal affairs: first, access to land for Aboriginal people for the economic and cultural security that it brings; second, further self-government and self-administration which provides Aboriginal people with the capacity for self-help and self-sufficiency instead of welfare dependency; and, third, the need for Aboriginal people to use their cultural pride, determination and even competition with other cultures as the basis for improving their standards and their lifetime aspirations. I believe that each of these three steps is confirmed and reflected in the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the position of the opposition, something I do not normally focus on excessively in second reading speeches. On this matter, however, I think it is worthy of consideration by the House. The Liberal and National parties in the debates on the Native Title Bill and now the land fund legislation have demonstrated their total inability to respond in a meaningful and consistent way to the High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2. That is, they have been unable to present a policy framework and structure in response to the most important social justice issue in this nation's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reflection of the inconsistency and political opportunism of the Liberal and the National parties was made totally evident last Thursday when the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), announced that this legislation would be supported by the opposition on its second reading&mdash;not because they think it is the best legislation that is available for the parliament. They produced an alternative bill in the Senate which is their preferred option. They are supporting this legislation not because they think it is the best legislation available for the parliament and for Aboriginal people in Australia but because it suits their political interests. It suits their political convenience in 1995 to deny the government an opportunity to call a double dissolution election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is full evidence of the disingenuous way in which the opposition treats Aboriginal affairs. They took up 35 hours of debate in the Senate on the original land fund legislation; produced 67 amendments; spent hundreds of hours in a Senate committee travelling all over Australia&mdash;12,000 kilometres were travelled by that committee; heard 244 witnesses; and there was a six-month delay in the process, all overturned, all thrown out because John Howard does not want the government to access a double dissolution election. Of course, the truth of the matter was made known by Senator Campbell, the chair of the Senate committee, one of the patronising Western Australian rednecks in the parliament, a genuine barbarian when one examines his views&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an important and interesting lesson here for the Western Australian Green senators and also for Aboriginal organisations like the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council that supported the coalition in that Senate process. The lesson for the Greens and Aboriginal organisations is this: never believe the Liberal and National parties care about Aboriginal people and good policy in this country more than they care about their own political interests. The truth is that those WA Green senators and Aboriginal groups like the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council were taken for a ride by the coalition and dumped at the side of the road as soon as it suited the coalition and their political agenda to dump their amendments in the Senate and to allow the passage of this legislation through both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not surprising from the Leader of the Opposition because he has always put himself first in politics. In all the things that have been spoken and written about the Leader of the Opposition it is sometimes overlooked that he has ripped down every Liberal leader in this country since Billy McMahon.

Last Thursday in this place, in responding to the Senate amendments on the original legislation, the Leader of the Opposition said,`I want to make it clear to those who sit opposite that they do not have a mortgage on compassion.' That was the proposition from the Leader of the Opposition. I thought it was a proposition worth testing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the test I have applied? I think it is a fair test&mdash;that any member of this parliament interested in Aboriginal affairs, genuinely compassionate about the subject, would have made a host of speeches on the scores of bills that have come before this House in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bennelong was first elected to the parliament in 1974 but he did not make a speech on Aboriginal affairs until 1988. That was in response to the government's motion in the bicentennial year on Aboriginal reconciliation. The response of the Leader of the Opposition was to tear down that motion of reconciliation by wanting to add an amendment to the words proposed by the government on 23 August 1988. He wanted to add the words `in common with all other Australians'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is his obsession&mdash;not compassion but commonality in Aboriginal affairs, wanting to pretend that Aboriginal people should have everything in common with other Australians and should be exactly like all other Australians, not recognising their unique circumstances in this nation's history. That was also reflected in the things he said just last Thursday, saying, `We are one people and one nation with one future and one common obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he says one nation, he really means one monocultural, white Anglo-Saxon Australia&mdash;one Wollstonecraft. That is what the Leader of the Opposition really means on Aboriginal affairs&mdash;one Wollstonecraft. You do not have to worry about compassion for Aboriginal people because you never see or meet any&mdash;they do not reside in that hamlet of the aristocracy on Sydney's north shore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is in no position to lecture and moralise to the government about compassion in Aboriginal affairs. In 21 years in this parliament, his only speeches on Aboriginal affairs were in 1988 to rip down the national reconciliation motion and then at the end of 1988 and the beginning of 1989 in response to allegations against the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he rolled into this place last Thursday with a suggestion that he has demonstrated compassion on Aboriginal affairs. That is not the case. I would challenge the members opposite, the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), to name one policy, one issue, one principle or one idea associated with the Leader of the Opposition that could be described as compassionate. In 21 years in this parliament, the closest he has got to compassion on Aboriginal affairs is the name of his electorate&mdash;because it is not in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record, it is not in the speeches and it is not in the ideas or concepts he has promoted on this important subject. </PARA>

The member opposite, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), obviously has nothing constructive to say about Aboriginal affairs. All he can do is abuse the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and speakers on this side. The truth of the matter is the government is in such a mess on this Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill that it actually had to withdraw its own legislation and start again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) crept in here, brought down a new bill and then left the country because the Australian Labor Party is trying to hide him from the voters in the New South Wales election. Now he is over in Singapore lecturing them on the evils of Packer, and in Germany telling them how to build their cities. He cannot even run his own country. He cannot even run his own party. And he certainly cannot run Aboriginal affairs. Yet he sets himself up as the authority on everything around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's record on Aboriginal affairs is to its great shame. It is appalling that the member who has just spoken should come in here and, in an attempt to hide the government's lack of policy, seek to criticise others. The reality is that the lot of Aboriginals in this country is simply a national disgrace, and no decent, caring person could observe the lifestyle of the Australian Aboriginal people without feeling deeply depressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics&mdash;the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survey&mdash;further illuminates the degradation and unsatisfactory aspects of Aboriginal lifestyle. Their lifespan is on average something like 17 years less than other Australians. Infant mortality is four times the national average. They are in hospital three times more often than other Australians. Unemployment is officially at 38 per cent, but if you add the 26 per cent involved in CDEP it is around 64 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that Aboriginals smoke more, drink more, have much greater rates of malnutrition and a wide range of diseases. They are also more likely to be killed or injured in car accidents and to be the victims of domestic violence or violent crime, almost always inflicted by members of their own race. Aborigines are 18 times more likely to be in goal than non-Aborigines, and they are in gaol more often because they have committed more crime, especially more serious and violent crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can anyone look at that kind of a record with any degree of self-satisfaction? How can the members of the government, who have been in office now for 12 years, consider that kind of record to be anything like satisfactory? I so often receive reports in my electorate office from constituents who have visited northern or central Australia, or other parts where there are large Aboriginal populations, who come back with appalling stories of smashed towns, barred windows, barricaded shops, drunken violence and reports that they feel it is unsafe to walk in the streets at night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Life in so many of these Aboriginal communities revolves around alcohol and hopeless despair. There are empty schools as towns flock to the canteens on pension days. That sort of lifestyle is simply unacceptable. No decent Australian could regard that as something that should be going on in what we regard as a modern and progressive First World country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the privilege to represent Cherbourg, which is without doubt one of the best Aboriginal communities in the country. It has outstanding facilities. I doubt whether there would be a town anywhere in the country with a population of 1,200 people that has the sortsocial security of facilities there are in Cherbourg&mdash;a fine new TAFE college, age care facilities, child-care facilities, schools and every other kind of public resource a community could wish to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many wonderful people live in Cherbourg but even in a community like that the town is not without its vandalism, murder, rape, drunkenness and violence. That leads many people to want to break the cycle and go somewhere else. Sadly, that is difficult for Aboriginal people. Those who do make a success of their lives often have to struggle not only to make their way in a normal society but also to gain acceptance among their own people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steve Renouf, perhaps the world's best rugby league centre, comes from the Cherbourg area. He was bashed recently and in the trial that followed it was said that he was bashed because he was too successful, he was becoming too much like a white man. That kind of attitude makes it very difficult for people to break out and make a success of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the key to an improved lifestyle for Australian Aborigines is more meaningful employment opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, something like 64 per cent of Aborigines do not have work, or do not have meaningful work. Most of those who do work are, sadly, in government jobs, in many cases filling positions because of artificial quotas and the like, or they are working on special Aboriginal programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aborigines want to work; they want to find positions where they can constructively contribute to their communities and make them better places in which to live. The Cherbourg community was persuaded by white advisers that it should not participate in the CDEP. They were told it was beneath the dignity of Aborigines to work for unemployment benefits. I happen to think that the CDEP is one of the best things that has happened in Aboriginal communities across the country in recent times. Indeed, the program should be extended to the entire Australian community. But, because there was no CDEP in Cherbourg, hundreds of Aborigines in that town moved to Woorabinda where the program was available. They wanted to work. Those people have come back to Cherbourg now that commonsense has prevailed and the CDEP is available there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times governments have been spending billions of dollars on Aboriginal welfare. I am not one of those who suggest that the government does not care. I believe that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) cares very deeply, as have governments of both political persuasions for many decades. Unfortunately, the minister is hopelessly naive and ill-advised. His solution to most of these problems is to try to paper over them with dollar bills. Never has more been spent for less result on Aboriginal welfare than at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A massive Aboriginal industry is being developed centred around ATSIC, land corporations and the like. This industry has attracted masses of white advisers, for many of whom it is an opportunity to exercise power and to massage their egos. For many it is a generous source of income; particularly lawyers and others who have been attracted to this industry like bees to the honey pot. Sadly, ATSIC and the Aboriginal industry is out of touch with the wishes and aspirations of Aboriginal people. It is hard to find an Aborigine in real Australia who has a good word to say for ATSIC and its bevy of advisers. ATSIC has succeeded in taking real power away from the real Aborigines, most of whom are too shy and ill-equipped to argue their cases in these sorts of forums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, ATSIC has developed a reputation for inefficiency and unaccountability. The recent example of ATSIC's attempt to suppress an unfavourable report into some of its activities is an example of an unwillingness to come to grips with the real issues and to make the organisation work effectively. Nepotism is rife. There is a lack of real representativeness about the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some will say that ATSIC elections are conducted and that the people who fill positions in ATSIC are elected. However, any close examination of the last set of ATSIC elections would cast deep doubt on the effectiveness of that representative process. There was only a 32 per cent voter turnout. The turnout ranged from 8.5 per cent in Sydney to 106 per cent at Mornington. One might ask how there could possibly have been a 106 per cent turnout at a poll, but that is what happened at this ATSIC election. Perhaps the most serious element is that only eight per cent turned up to vote in some other electorates. In the Northern Territory, in the electorate Nhulunbuy South, four ATSIC councillors were elected from only 10 formal votes. There were an estimated 845 voters on the roll, of whom 489 actually voted, but 477 of those were rejected and a further two were treated as informal. That left only 10 formal votes to elect four ATSIC councillors. That questions the real worth of the election process. In southern Queensland only 16 per cent of the estimated 9,000 voters in Brisbane bothered to vote. Those sorts of figures are repeated across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of these sorts of programs has proved to be an effective way of representing the real wishes of the Aboriginal people. A massive bureaucracy is developing. It has all the money and all the power, but it has lost its way in addressing the issues of concern to Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, this land fund bill will add a further brick to the wall that is dividing the real power in the Aboriginal industry from the real people. The government's solution to all of the problems confronting Aborigines at the present time is to throw another billion dollars at a land fund, as though extra acres will solve the problem, as though having more land, more areas, around the country will reduce the risk of AIDS, will take people out of hospitals and will improve their education lot. Simply, that is not going to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned that the key purpose of this land fund is to assist those Aborigines who have no hope of making claims under the Mabo process. Many of those, in fact probably most of them, are located in urban situations. This same national survey on Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders reported that almost 70 per cent of urban based Aborigines cannot identify with any homeland at all; that they have totally lost identity with any particular parcel of land. Of course it is not in the least bit surprising that they have lost that identity because they have not lived on the land for generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no doubt at all that the importance of land rights has been grossly overstated as a solution to Aboriginal degradation. The case has been exaggerated so often and repeated on so many occasions that many community leaders, and even members of this House, seem to be accepting it as some kind of magic pudding solution. Over recent years very large areas of land have been made available to Aboriginal people in various forms, so it is possible to test the academic theory that land ownership will resolve Aboriginal health, education and social problems. But even the most superficial visit to areas where Aboriginals have had title to their land for perhaps decades will demonstrate that there has been very little, if any, improvement in the living conditions of the land owners. Indeed, in most instances their circumstances have become even worse. There is little employment and no optimism for the future. No matter how much extra land is acquired, these problems simply will not be resolved because land title is not the cure-all that the warm-hearted academics might wish us to think it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not dispute the view that land ownership is important to Aborigines. Most Aborigines do love the land and have a strong attachment to it, just as the family farmer has an attachment to his land and aged pensioners have an attachment to the family home when they are expected to move off to a nursing home or some kind of hostel accommodation. There is an attachment to land. There is good reason to try to provide opportunities for Aborigines to own land to help develop their independence and to give them an opportunity to strike out and make new lives for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This land fund needs to be used effectively. It needs to address the real issues. That is why the coalition has been prepared to accept the development of a land fund. We have tried to improve the legislation so that it will really make some contribution to effectively addressing the problems of Aboriginal degradation. But the government has failed to take up the key issues. Indeed, Senator Gareth Evans was quoted as saying that we were destroying the bill by creating seven deadly sins. I think it is important that, in the context of this new government legislation, we look at what those seven deadly sins of the opposition are&mdash;the seven deadly reasons as to why the land fund should not be improved to achieve effective results for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that we wanted the land fund to give priority to the most disadvantaged. Is the government seriously suggesting that the money and the land should be given to those who have already got land available to them, who have already got significant resources? Surely, it should be targeted at those who need it most, those who can get the greatest benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so providing this priority we would be focusing the fund where it could provide the most benefit. The Prime Minister in response said that it would just be a field day for the lawyers. Listen to who is talking&mdash;the man who has created the kind of environment that has brought lawyers out of their multistorey towers to feed on the Aboriginal industry now for decades. If the government really wants to get lawyers out of the Aboriginal industry, I will support him wholeheartedly. But what the government has done to date has just created endless court cases and endless opportunities for lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second proposal was to allow land to be granted to individuals and trusts, as well as to corporations. This is clearly a key element. Aborigines do not feel as though they own land when the title is held by some corporation or land trust. They do not regard it as really theirs. Those corporations are part of the Aboriginal industry, which is remote from the real people. Aborigines need to identify with a parcel of land that is really theirs and take responsibility for that parcel if ownership is to mean anything worth while to them. If they have something to pass onto their families, I am sure that would greatly enrich their lifestyle and give them real reason to hope for the future. That is a vital and important element of any effective land fund operation. It really must be a non-negotiable aspect of our dealings in considering this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third deadly sin was that we would require the land fund body to have regard to health, housing and education needs when deciding the grants. Surely those are the priorities. Is the government only saying that it wants to acquire land for the sake of adding to the acreage? How many acres will be necessary to solve the Aboriginal problems? Aborigines already own about 16 per cent of the land mass of the country. Will 20, 30 or 40 per cent solve their problems? What is the magic number? Clearly, the answer is not acres but what you do with the land. We want land to be used so it can benefit Aboriginal health, housing and education needs. If the program is going to be in the least bit effective, it must be used for those purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our fourth deadly sin is that we want the land fund bodies to consult Aborigines with traditional links to land before buying it for others. There have already been many instances in Australia of land being given to the wrong groups&mdash;the people with the political power rather than the real claims to the region. An effective mechanism is needed to ensure that those with legitimate claims to a region are consulted and that their land is not given to other people, as is happening so often around Australia at the present time. There are plenty of government funded claims at the moment against other Aboriginal groups which would have had a much more legitimate claim to that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our fifth proposal is that there be a limit on the amount of money wasted on administration. ATSIC and many of these land bodies are infamous for their expenditure on their own administration, flying around the country and ensuring that their own administration needs are met. We want to limit the waste on administration. The government is saying that it is not important and that it is a deadly sin that we should propose to limit the amount of money spent on administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth deadly sin is that we also want to remove the need for central approval by the body before land is sold. If you really have genuine freehold title to land, that implies a capacity to buy and sell. In order to be able to borrow against the land asset, a bank is going to need security and the ability to sell the land in the event of default. That is an essential element of landownership. If the government is serious about providing landownership rights to Aborigines, it must accept that principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our seventh and final deadly sin is that we want regional strategies to ensure that the acquired land is bought following proper planning. In that way, the fund can be used effectively to benefit the largest number of Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has made it clear that, upon election to government, we will review this legislation. We will ensure that it starts to work effectively. There are still many faults in the bill that is before the House. The concerns of many Aboriginal groups have remained unanswered, and the failure of the government's approach in this particular area has not been addressed. There is a clear need for Australians to take responsibility and do something worth while to improve the lot of our Aboriginal people. This land fund will not achieve that objective. It could have, but the government has failed to seize the opportunities that were available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last speech, made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), is a good example of the coalition's strategy in relation to the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill and other matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. The honourable member just said that the coalition policy was to review the legislation after the unlikely election of a Howard government. That is not the understanding I have of what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), have said. Senator Campbell, who was the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that, with an election coming up in a year's time, forcing the hand of the amendments probably doesn't achieve much because the Coalition can promise to deliver the amendments after the next election when John Howard is elected Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition has said that they will not review it. They know what their amendments are, and they are going to introduce them. One of those amendments greatly affects my electorate; that is, the question of degrees of dispossession. I will return to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, the coalition's strategy is a purely political attempt to screw some political advantage out of a very serious and very important issue. I think the coalition has two strategies. One could be described as the Jeff Kennett strategy. It is the same approach that Jeff Kennett took when there was a problem in this country between Macedonians and Greeks. He did not think it was a good idea to get people together in the usual Australian manner and work towards some conciliation. He took one side for purely political advantage, and that is what coalition members have done in relation to their proposed amendment about degrees of dispossession. They have found one group that does not like the bill and have said, `We'll talk about degrees of dispossession. We'll divide the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. That'll fix the government. That'll stop some of the support that the government gets within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.' That is the first strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second strategy, which we see every time we debate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this House, is the Mutt'n Jeff strategy&mdash;the good cop, bad cop. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and perhaps the previous speaker are the bad cops. They put forward views that could be seen as contrary to the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They play to the lowest common denominator in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne)&mdash;in the past I would have included the honourable member for Hindmarsh in this category, but I am not sure where she sits now&mdash;who say to Aboriginal people, `It's all right; we have a few crazies in the party. The National Party is a bit of a problem, but in government we'll fix it up. It will be all right. Do not worry about it. We're the good guys. If you  support the government too much, the bad guys in the coalition might have their way.' That is an equally despicable strategy. That is the sort of thing that we have had in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that there has not been wide consultation on this issue is completely absurd. We had the total absurdity of the Senate Select Committee on the Land Fund Bill. That committee came to my electorate in Cairns. As per usual, no notification was given to me, as the local member of the House of Representatives. I only represent the people directly; I am fairly irrelevant! Because I have good links with the Aboriginal community in Cairns in the Far North they let me know. I came along for a little while and watched this high farce. I now have the benefit of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of that day. From what I understand, the best summation of this committee as it went right throughout Australia was that its members asked people, `You really haven't been consulted about this, have you?' People said, `We do have some misgivings. We think there should be some more money.' Committee members then said, `So you agree that you have not been consulted.' The reality is that there has been considerable consultation in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate select committee came to Cairns on 24  January. As I said, I was not notified. I was sitting in the body of the hall opposite the railway institute in Cairns when I noticed some people that I did not recognise. As I am in close contact with most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in my electorate, I wondered who those people were. They appeared to me to be Torres Strait Islander people. I asked someone and was told, `Oh, they're the people from Townsville.' That was the marvellous consultation this committee had with people in North Queensland. It spent one day in Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee in the other place said that it takes five hours to drive from Townsville to Cairns. He would not know. He is only a relatively infrequent visitor to Cairns. It takes four hours to drive there. It is a long way. It is absolutely absurd to suggest that going from Townsville to Cairns and giving people there half an hour is consultation. Yet the government has a long record in relation to consultation in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while looking at some of the evidence given to the Senate select committee in Cairns. The committee spoke to Mr Noel Pearson, who is well known. Mr Pearson made some constructive comments in relation to the legislation. Some of them have been taken up by the government in relation to the amendments we have accepted. Mr Pearson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what I am concerned about is that it is a really difficult question to define who is more dispossessed than the other. Most of Cape York Peninsula&mdash;something like 60 per cent of it&mdash;is pastoral lease. So more than half of the indigenous population of the cape do not have any land at all because all of their country is covered by pastoral leases. Can you say that those people are less or more dispossessed than people on the eastern seaboard, in the more settled areas of the country? Clearly not; the people living at Coen are just as dispossessed as people living at Cowra in New South Wales. I hope that the remote urban argument that emerged over this clause has not obscured the fact that there are just as many dispossessed people in remote Australia as there are in the settled areas of the country.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums it up. The only motive for perpetuating such an amendment is to attempt to divide and rule the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. That is the only motive. I will be quite happy to inform people in my electorate of the coalition's strategy in relation to this matter. I will be quite happy to go around Leichhardt and tell people in the next election that it is the coalition's policy that they should get to the end of the queue because they are the least dispossessed in relation to the land fund. The coalition's policy is, `People in the north should get to the end of the queue because we are trying to shore up some votes in New South Wales.' That is basically the strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other interesting evidence was given to the Senate select committee in relation to this debate. Some comments by Ms Nerelle Nicol, who is the chairperson of the Cairns and District Regional Council of ATSIC, are well worth quoting. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continually seeking further consultation with indigenous people questions the integrity of ATSIC, does nothing more than divide indigenous peoples and makes a mockery of the establishment of ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not me speaking; that comment was made by the elected local chairperson of ATSIC. She continued:</PARA>

<PARA>That was the attitude of the chairperson of the Cairns and District Regional Council of ATSIC in relation to the coalition's sham of trying to divide and rule Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. It is an absolute disgrace. I am going to be very fair. It is true that on that day Mr Rosendale, who is the chairperson of the peninsula regional development council, expressed some concern that the people of remote areas of the Cape York Peninsula were not fully informed about the details of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did speak to the regional council last June when I was with the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and that matter was not raised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we are going to introduce legislation soon on bankruptcy. I have seen the draft legislation, which is fairly large. If you went into the community and asked people whether they understand every detail of that legislation they would say, `No, we do not understand it.' These matters are complex. But the reality is that the government has consulted very broadly in relation to this issue. Before I get off this point, other contributions in relation to the degree of dispossession were very clear. They rejected the coalition on the degree of dispossession. They rejected the coalition about individual ownership of land. That is a separate issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that there are some impediments to Aboriginal people owning their own land. But that is not the issue that is being addressed by this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth going through the consultations that have taken place in relation to this legislation. Negotiations on this land fund&mdash;and remember, it is part of a trilogy that the government has always said it will support&mdash;began during consultations on the Native Title Act, which originally established the land fund. Then consultations took place on the details of how the land fund and the ILC would operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) wrote to all ATSIC regional councils, land councils, legal services and prescribed organisations under the Native Title Act as well as peak indigenous, industry, farming, mining and religious organisations on 11 April 1994 seeking the submission of views on the structure and operation of the proposed land fund.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) then met with representatives of major Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations on 18 April 1994 and again on 16 June 1994.

He did not, of course, because he has never made any statements. I think he made his maiden speech on Aboriginal affairs in this House the other day. I know that because a local organisation asked me to see whether John Howard had made any statements about Aboriginal affairs. I advised the organisation that I did not think there would be.

I understand that if you added it all up the Senate select committee would have taken a couple of weeks to consult with people. I mentioned the farce of the committee coming to Cairns and consulting with Townsville people. I suppose it thought it was consulting with people from Mount Isa, Cunnamulla and right throughout North Queensland as well&mdash;although there was not anybody there. They probably could not get there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee members did not go to the Aboriginal and islander communities; they went only to the capital cities. I think they went to Adelaide for a day and Sydney for a day. That is the sort of wide consultation they have. We would not want them to interfere with their holidays to consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is the situation in relation to the coalition's policy&mdash;a total sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund bill is part of the government's broader strategy. We recognise that there are other issues to be dealt with but, when we talk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, always at the top of the list comes land. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, nodding in agreement. As a white person I probably do not understand the importance of land; it is probably beyond my understanding but that is what happens&mdash;that is what comes shining through. That is what the government accepts about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; but we are concerned about the other issues&mdash;and the Prime Minister is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very proud to have the Prime Minister visit my electorate a couple of weeks ago, on 24 February. He came to Hopevale, an Aboriginal community in my electorate. There were representatives from all over Cape York Peninsula. He referred to his great Redfern speech. I think that in some ways the speech he made in Hopevale is a second Redfern speech. It is just as significant. I urge all members to get a copy of it and read it. I will end with the conclusions the Prime Minister came to that day. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These things can be done&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is referring to government policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but what has to be done is to put the strategy together and not be territorial about it. So for my part I said in Redfern in 1992 we&mdash;the community of Australia&mdash;want a new relationship with the Aboriginal community. We understand the history; we understand the sins; and we want to make reparations and we want a reconciliation. Of these, we have now sought step by step to do so&mdash;Mabo, the land fund&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is what we are debating here today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">now health and with health will be the environmental issues of housing, sewerage etc. We should be able to do it together; together is the only way to do it.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the message of his visit. So all this coalition nonsense about amendments in relation to health and housing is another red herring because the government is addressing these issues. The stark reality is that the states have the constitutional responsibility for primary and tertiary health care. They are the ones, if any, that should be criticised&mdash;Labor governments as well as coalition governments in that regard. They should be criticised for the health statistics but now the Prime Minister and the Commonwealth government are doing something about it. This bill is very much at the centre of that strategy.

To those in the gallery who have come into this place today marvelling at the size of Parliament House, it cost approximately $1.2 billion to build.

The member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) said in his speech on 6 March:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Undoubtedly, coalition members are just into sabotaging this Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. They have no real commitment or interest in doing anything about it. There is a real lack of either interest or commitment amongst them to do anything constructive to help the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA>We are supporting this bill. We are supporting the amendments that have been brought in. We do not believe there are enough amendments, but we are supporting this bill. Yet the member for Oxley perpetuates the myth that we are not supportive of helping Aboriginal people. The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is the chairman of the committee, made reference to how long the debates were and how many days the debates on this issue have been in the House. He said that it is all a matter of time. I got thinking about it being time and I went to the `It's time for leadership' speech in 1972 by Gough Whitlam. He said in his speech on page 30:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will establish an Aboriginal land fund to purchase or acquire land for significant continuing Aboriginal communities and to appropriate $5 million per year to fund this for the next 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that in 1972. How come it has taken until 1995 for this to happen? It has taken 22 years for the government to actually get this up. You have been in power since 1972&mdash;about 17 years. It is now finally here. You are talking about it being time. Let us not have this talk about a couple of days to debate this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moreton also talked about cowardice on the part of the Greens and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and how we buckled under the pressure.

Yet one of the major amendments in this particular bill we are talking about is that we are asking for people to have business experience, which was not part of the first bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who is also on the committee, spoke about the Leader of the Opposition and attacked his defence of the constitution in 1988.

I do not understand her attitude when it comes to threatening the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also talked about Mark Baker from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> whom she quoted as being an expert on the coalition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also said that it is a sham commitment. Everyone on the other side of the parliament believes that we have a sham commitment here because we are now facilitating an easy passage of this particular bill. I do not think anyone was expecting it. Therefore, because we are supporting them, it is all a sham. I do not think these myths should continue to be perpetuated by those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition said in his speech on 2 March:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is true, but those in the coalition who have been virtuous about Aboriginal policy are not on the front bench . . . There has been no virtue on your front bench. Fancy talking about playing politics after your shabby performance. You have done nothing but play politics.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the Prime Minister who is, in fact, playing politics. The shadow health minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), was for some time the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I believe he was the first person in this place to raise the issue about HIV-AIDS within the Aboriginal community. No-one on the Labor Party's side had mentioned anything about HIV-AIDS until Dr Wooldridge did. Now he is on the front bench. There is another trumped-up charge by the Prime Minister who plays this silly game of politics which I believe the Australian people are getting very sick of.

This was the report of the inquiry into the implementation by governments of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. It was tabled last year and has yet to be responded to by the government, which is fairly typical in relation to both Aboriginal affairs and the committee structure in this place.

Minister Howe, the minister for housing, said, `Yes, we need some extra housing; we need more help in the housing area.' I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rhetoric or reality</EMPHASIS> report where it was recommended that the backlog of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing needed to be addressed over the next 10 years as a matter of priority.

Over 54,000 people live in communities with unsealed or partly sealed roads; over 3,000 people had experienced water restrictions in the previous 12 months, mostly due to infrastructure limitations.

We are the sham merchants and they are the experts in this particular field!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts overcome all that. The facts are pretty damning.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The misconception of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community organisations being the sole service provider is particularly highlighted in the delivery of health services. There is a strong belief that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander medical services are there to deliver the full range of health services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and also that it is the responsibility of ATSIC to totally fund these organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>It was said to be a misconception in 1993. Now in 1995 the minister is taking responsibility. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The poor state of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is well known. On all indicators the state of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is considerably worse than that of the wider community. Access to adequate health services is a basic right but one which is denied to many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Evidence was given by ATSIC that 80% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are reliant on mainstream services.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the responsibility of Minister Lawrence&mdash;80 per cent of Aboriginal people already are reliant on them. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee heard significant evidence that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not receive equitable access or reasonable treatment in most mainstream health services. It can therefore be concluded that this has resulted in many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people not receiving adequate health care.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in supporting of the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. I do so recognising that this is a situation on which the Australian community expects action from the Australian parliament. As Professor Bill Stanner wrote in his 1968 Boyer lecture:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every fence in Australia encloses land that was once the sole or the shared possession of a particular group of Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA>For the past 200 years, Australia has had a fundamental problem that stems from the dispossession of Australia's indigenous people from their land. It also has had the problem of coming to grips with the fact that the Aboriginal people have a special relationship with the land. As said earlier in this debate, it is not a simple notion of possession of land as individual property; its basis is spiritual or religious. It has a lot to do with the way that Aboriginals organise themselves in a social context and culturally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can stand here in the knowledge that the bulk of the Australian people accept that we need to address Aboriginals and their relationship to the land, their ability to have access to land, and their ability to do what they choose to do with that land. In fact, the expectation of the Australian community for the Australian parliament to be involved in matters to do with Aboriginal affairs is longstanding. If we look at the 1967 referendums to repeal section 127 of the constitution, which had the effect of granting Aboriginals full political rights, in no federal electorate was the affirmative vote less than 71 per cent. No referendum has had greater support from the Australian people. The Australian people support the efforts of this government to address the dispossession of the indigenous people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can also be no doubt that, increasingly, Australia has been judged as a nation in international forums on our record of treatment of our indigenous people. In November 1972 the former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, said in his policy speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us never forget this . . . Australia's treatment of her Aboriginal people will be the thing upon which the rest of the world will judge Australia and Australians&mdash;not just now, but in the greater perspective of history . . . The Aborigines are a responsibility we cannot escape, cannot share, cannot shuffle off; the world will not let us forget that.</PARA>
<PARA>That is as true now as it was 20 years ago. Following the High Court decision in 1992, the historic Redfern speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) must go down as a turning point in the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. The first stage of the process of responding to the High Court decision and enacting the sentiment of reconciliation that imbued the Prime Minister's Redfern speech was the Native Title Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that, for many on this side of the House, being present for the passage of that bill was one of the proudest moments that anyone could have had as an Australian parliamentarian. Historians will look back at the Native Title Act as one of the greatest achievements of this Labor government, and it should be remembered that the Australian people overwhelmingly supported the passage of that bill. That is why the honeymoon of the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), ended so abruptly&mdash;he proposed to open an issue which the Australian community believed had been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next stage of the response to the High Court's decision, and to enact this party's longstanding commitment to social justice for indigenous Australians, was the land fund bill. This bill, as we now know, will pass both houses of the parliament. But, unfortunately, it will do so under a cloud, that cloud being the threat that a future conservative coalition government, as unlikely a prospect as that is, will amend it. The effect of those amendments would be to deny indigenous Australians the justice to which they are entitled. That is why those amendments have been rejected by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land fund that will be established will assist indigenous people to obtain land and provide them with social, cultural and economic benefits. In the long term, it will redress the dispossession which those who have lost their connection with the land continue to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of a land fund is not new. As has been pointed out by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), when the Whitlam government established a land fund in 1974 it was unanimously passed by this government. As the minister also pointed out, it was a Liberal minister, Ian Viner, who established the Aboriginal Development Commission in 1980 to take over the functions of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, with the clear objective of acquiring land for the use of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the current opposition is sad because it indicates a degeneration into narrow right wing extremism on this issue. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) seems intent on convincing the electorate that he does not believe in anything but, by his own words, he remains the most conservative leader that the opposition in this country has ever had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other aspects of our relations with Aboriginals that are important for us to address. As the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has stated in previous debates about land fund bills, at the moment we see a three-stage set: the first stage was the native title legislation; the second stage is this land fund bill; and the third stage is the social justice package. </PARA>

Unfortunately it is a theme that, on a whole host of matters in this place, I find myself returning to. I refer to the inadequacies of the constitution. In 1967 a referendum was overwhelmingly passed by the Australian community to repeal section 127 of the constitution. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in May 1992 Ron Castan indicated that there are aspects of concern about our constitution that probably need addressing before we can achieve proper reconciliation. In his article Castan maintained that section 25 of the constitution, if it remains unaltered, is an ugly blot on the constitutional landscape of Australia. Section 25 provides that if a state chooses to make laws excluding Aborigines from voting then they may not vote for the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that that provision might be used, or that there is a threat that it will be used, but while a query such as that hangs over the constitution we cannot expect to properly reconcile indigenous Australians with non-indigenous Australians. Castan indicates that the constitution does not actually acknowledge the existence of Aboriginal people. As an irony, he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It did so before 1967, but only in order to exclude them from participation in the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not raise this as an example of the politics of guilt but, when the constitution was being formulated 100 years ago, the constitution reflected a contemporary relationship between non-indigenous Australians and indigenous Australians. We have seen those attitudes change. We have seen that those attitudes have improved. We have seen that those attitudes have progressed. As we go into our second century of federation we need to formally resolve, through constitutional change, these aspects that have been left unattended. Castan concluded his article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But there can be no `reconciliation' without constitutional recognition in some form, and without the abolition of the relics of racism in our Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>I would hope that, if we can get the excitement and the heat of political debate about matters such as the bill before us to dissipate as we move towards the centenary of Federation, as the Australian community and as the international community expect of us, we will be able to redress the problems that exist in our relationship with Aboriginal people as a result of events throughout our history since European occupation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody disagrees that the commentaries on the living conditions and the commentaries on the health of Aboriginal people referred to by both sides of this chamber are something that Australia as a nation which has a concern for human rights throughout the globe should address on its doorstep.

But will land rights achieve everything? While it goes some of the way, I do not think it will go all the way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the very good experience to be part of a delegation to southern Africa following the election in South Africa last year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Aboriginal woman recently said to me, `Just because I'm black it doesn't mean I have Labor stamped all over me.' I think it is unfortunate that so often the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) takes to bullying ways and it has suited him to play politics about Aboriginal people, their plight and what many of us would hope would make things better for them. I do not think we should be stooping to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) seems to have come to this place exhibiting those characteristics as well. When only this week my colleague the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) asked a question about the potential threat of HIV-AIDS to the Aboriginal and Islander communities, did she give a factual answer? No, she gave a political answer. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may suit the member to show this recent concern for Aboriginal health . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where she has been, because my colleague first raised his concerns in 1987 and Aboriginal health was also the subject of his first speech to the parliament on becoming Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. This is true to form because in May last year, when I questioned her about funding for Aboriginal health, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once you show a degree of seriousness, then I think you will have a right to ask those sorts of questions.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not expect everyone in this place to know what I am serious about but, equally, care should be taken in making such purely political accusations. Later, one of her colleagues did apologise to me for what she said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, the Liberal Party has a record that it can be proud of as far as our indigenous people and human rights are concerned. As a sideline, in South Africa I was shown the room where two former prime ministers had an argument and told the story about that. I was also told that on that occasion Mr Hawke was drumming up his own business and Malcolm Fraser was drumming up more aid for Rwanda. There is the odd attempt to change history, as we have found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Liberal premier of South Australia, David Tonkin, and his government have a proud record when it comes to Aboriginal land rights. Late last year I visited Bourke to see what was happening there in Aboriginal health and Aboriginal affairs. I met Yvonne Howarth at the Aboriginal medical service there and she told me that the only Aboriginal affairs ministers she had seen in Bourke were Peter Baume and Fred Chaney. They are both friends of mine and were both Liberal ministers, not Labor ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could give more examples, but I repeat: if the government is serious about reconciliation and truly making things better for Aboriginal people it has to drop the politics, pay attention to detail and do some long-term planning. Quite recently, in speaking on the health legislation in this place, I quoted the former health minister, then senator Graham Richardson, when he was discussing Labor's rule overall. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There ought not to be a rule in Australian politics against thinking ahead. We have operated in a fog for a number of years in which that rule has I think been observed, by and large by too many of us. We think three years between elections&mdash;we can do something in the first, try and wrap it up in the second, and in the third spend the time talking about what we will do next time. That's a pretty pathetic way to run Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Recently, I spoke to an Aboriginal woman who, in reference to the Labor government, said that they cannot just beat their breasts and say they are wonderful for giving Aboriginal people land rights, what about getting our kids off alcohol? She went on to tell me about the national park at Mutawintjee, which is between Broken Hill and Wilcannia. She told me of young boys who love going there in their school holidays. They develop self-esteem, they are taught to show the tourists around, and they say they are not interested in alcohol or cigarettes. It is important that we do not set up the Aboriginal people to fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the state of their health has received some coverage in this place, but it deserves more. On average, Australians of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent live significantly shorter lives than other Australians. While they are alive, their wellbeing is impaired by illness to a far greater extent. On page 4 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beyond the Maze</EMPHASIS>, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diseases which account for most Aboriginal deaths include: heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke, injury and poisoning, and respiratory disease. Death rates from respiratory disease among Aboriginal people are seven to eight times greater than for non-Aboriginal people. A higher rate of infection associated with overcrowding and also tobacco use contribute to this excess. Aboriginal people also have a much higher death rate from infectious and parasitic diseases, around 12 to 13 times the rate for Australia as a whole . . . Aboriginal mothers are much more likely to die in childbirth than are non-Aboriginal mothers: their excess risk does not appear to have changed over the last two decades . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, we should ask why; and, secondly, we should ask what can be done to improve the health status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In looking at those causes, health improves in line with improved living conditions. It is important to raise this matter at this time because, if we are giving land to Aboriginal people&mdash;and I am not opposed to doing that&mdash;long-term planning and attention to detail are important. Will this land be away from the very services that are needed? Will it be away from a water supply? Will it be away from roads? Will it be away from the facilities that will be necessary to improve their health?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, particularly the 50 per cent that live rurally and the 22 per cent that live in remote communities, do not enjoy the same standard of housing and public infrastructure as other Australians. Housing is often overcrowded, badly planned and poorly maintained. In such an environment, it is difficult to sustain hygienic living practices or to avoid stress and domestic violence. Water supplies for the purposes of drinking, cooking and washing are often inadequate&mdash;again making hygienic living practices difficult&mdash;and/or contaminated, thus providing a medium for the spread of infection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sanitation services such as sewerage and garbage disposal are often non-existent or inadequate&mdash;again providing mediums for the spread of infection. Transport and communication facilities needed to address health care services are often non-existent or inadequate. Some communities are not even connected to power; hence, no refrigeration. That has implications for the food that they are attempting to store and their diet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their health is influenced by the access that an individual has to health services. The most obvious barriers to accessing health services is distance, a problem exacerbated by poor roads and lack of transport. Of course, these are problems which are intrinsic to life in small, remote communities&mdash;problems which are shared by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians alike. Access to health services can also be diminished by cultural barriers. Access to local health services may be effectively closed if the service provided is so alien or offensive to Aboriginal people that they choose not to, or are unable to, use that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of cultural barriers was reinforced in my mind during a telephone conservation I had with Dr Stephen Birrell from the Flinders Medical Centre. I spoke to him when he was a relieving surgeon at the Darwin hospital, and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am currently sitting in an office on the 8th floor of Darwin Hospital looking out over asphalt and dirt, and seeing Aboriginal patients with bandages sitting there simply because they don't like this hospital. This hospital was planned in Canberra by bureaucrats who based it on Woden Valley hospital and yet 65% of the patients here are Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA>Health is also affected by socioeconomic status. As is the experience of non-Aborigines, welfare dependent Aborigines suffer mentally and then physically from their social and economic marginalisation. This process is deepened when entire communities are marginalised. The Commonwealth has a role in these areas, and some things have occurred to me which would improve the obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has a role in developing incentives for doctors&mdash;which I think is under way&mdash;to work in rural communities. I wonder whether thought has been given to providing incentives to nurses to work in these same communities. It is essential to be able to communicate well with local people. It is important to involve Aboriginal people themselves. When I was travelling through western New South Wales, I was told at the Walgett hospital how difficult that was to achieve because of the low academic qualifications of the Aboriginal people there. They asked how they could be taught the same courses that the nurses there had been taught. In giving that some considerable thought, it seemed sensible to me that each community should be looked at from its own perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal people there could be taught at a level that could certainly give them a role to play in improving the health of the other people in their community. I wanted to develop this theory of mine further. I visited the Key Centre for Women's Health in Melbourne. I found that we are teaching women from Third World countries a level of health care which is culturally appropriate and which can benefit their community. That struck me as a very sensible thing to do for our own Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be considered that Aboriginal people may not wish to be taken out of their own communities. Why can we not send the trainers to them? Very basic literacy skills could be taught. Aborigines could be taught about hygiene, diet and diabetes. Trainers could encourage Aboriginal mothers to bring their children in for immunisation. If we look at each of these areas quite specifically, we should find ways to improve the lot of Aboriginal people without costing a lot of money. Money was set aside in the white paper for training. It has been argued by some that unemployed people are being trained for jobs that do not exist. However, when I visited places like Walgett, Brewarrina, Wilcannia and Bourke, it seemed to me that there were jobs for people in those communities if only these people could have some very basic training. Their esteem would rise and it could give their community some real pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am sure we could go on and on talking about what would be good for our fellow indigenous Australians, but I think we must treat the matter seriously. I certainly intend to and, as I said earlier, I think there are people on both sides of this House who would hold that same view. I write regularly for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medicine</EMPHASIS>. I have had an article on indigenous health published, which addresses some of the areas I have covered in my speech today. The subject of whether ATSIC should control the funding for Aboriginal health has been aired. In my trip through western New South Wales, Aboriginal people said to me that, while they wanted some control over their own health services, they felt that ATSIC was removed from their local community and that there was not enough expertise in ATSIC to assist in the health area where it was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I said earlier, I think that attention to detail, some long-term planning and some goodwill will go a long way in making the lives of Aboriginal Australians better. While land is important to them&mdash;land is important to white Australians as well&mdash;I do not think it is the sole solution, as I hope I have indicated to the House today. But I guess it is going some way there. We certainly cannot think, `Well, that's it. It's all over.' We must work together to make things better. We must work for true forgiveness and true reconciliation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real hope for Aboriginal people, the real step forward in their achievement of full dignity and status in this community, came not from this parliament, I regret to say, but from the High Court in Mabo.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Premier of Western Australia began his great crusade against Mabo, was there a single member on the front bench of the Liberal Party, was there a single member of the opposition in this House, who would stand up and say, `I dissociate myself from this lunacy'? The two prominent Western Australians who did that were distinguished former ministers in the Fraser government, Mr Viner and Mr Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In retrospect, when one looks at the attitudes of the then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, it was to his credit that his government introduced the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which state Liberal governments have attacked on almost a daily basis. If one goes back to the history of legislation trying to deal with these issues one finds, for example, that in Victoria the Bolte government gave back Lake Tyers. There were only two reserves, and they were not very large. There was Lake Tyers and Framlingham. When the Cain Labor government tried to emulate the example of the Bolte government and give back Framlingham, which was little better than a decent sized farm, it was voted out by members of the Liberal and National parties in the upper house. We had to put the legislation through this parliament. It was voted against by members of the coalition. Why? Because it was an interference with state rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Burke government in Western Australia tried to introduce a state land rights legislation. It passed the assembly but it was voted out in the upper house. I had my own reservations about that legislation because I did not think it went far enough. The then state leaders of the Liberal Party in Western Australia made no apology for their action. It was not a matter that they disagreed with the terms of the legislation; it was that they were opposed in principle to any concept of land rights. Whatever you say about the present Premier of Western Australia, at least he is consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get a bit sick of hearing this argument about state rights in the debate in this House. I accept the fact that it is a matter of genuine concern for many members of this parliament, including members of the coalition. When they talk about the lack of sewerage facilities in Aboriginal communities, they are right. They talk about the lack of water, effective housing, lack of educational opportunities and health. I do not disagree with any of those complaints, but the administration of health, the administration of education, the provision of water supplies, questions of housing and sewerage are state responsibilities. There is no question about that; that is where the administrative structures are. It is where the infrastructure and the capacity are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that occurs when there is funding coming from the Commonwealth to deal with Aboriginal education, health or any of these issues is that the states say, `You have to give us the money so we can do it.' How is it that these great states righters, when they get up to very properly criticise the lack of these facilities&mdash;and it varies from state to state&mdash;all of a sudden act as if these are Commonwealth responsibilities. It is the federal minister for Aboriginal affairs who they say has to carry the buck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to go into any major community centres in any part of Australia where there is a large indigenous population to see Aboriginal children who should be at school. What state education administration, with the possible exception of Queensland, has taken seriously the question of Aboriginal education? In Queensland, because Aboriginal communities were put on a reservation and the manager of that reservation had the power almost of life and death over the constituents, under previous governments a standard state school went into those communities, and if the people did not send their kids to school they were in trouble. That produced a tradition within Aboriginal communities that their kids were sent to school. I do not think it is an accident that at the University of Townsville there is probably the largest single number of Aboriginal youths in training. It might be an accident; but that is what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state, if there was a fight between two Aboriginal youths in a technical college and two non-Aboriginal children it was the Aboriginal kids who got expelled. There was a recent example of an educational institution that was working for Aboriginal children and other children with serious social disadvantages. The state government not only closed the school but went to court to try to sustain that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good expressing a concern when there is not a minister for Aboriginal affairs, past or present, who will tell you that he has not taken up these issues with his state colleagues. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say under Mabo or when the High Court makes a decision, `This is an infringement of states rights.' We cannot insist that these things be done through the states and, when there is criticism to be made in all these areas&mdash;and they are legitimate areas of criticism&mdash;suddenly say that these things are the responsibility of the Commonwealth. That is neither accurate nor fair. There is no minister for Aboriginal affairs or anybody who knows anything about Aboriginal society who will accept the argument about consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not care who the minister is or was and whether he consults 200 people or 200 communities. Anybody who knows about Aboriginal society could pick another 200 communities and say, `You didn't consult them.' That is the disparate nature of those communities and the way they are structured. I cannot think of a single issue pertaining to Aboriginal people where any minister could say with confidence that he had consulted all the people it was necessary to consult. I believe there would be unanimity of view on that from anybody who has been a minister and has tried to genuinely consult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members of the opposition have pointed out what they regard as inadequate in this legislation. They have attacked the fact that there has been a lack of consultancy&mdash;and I have dealt with that. They have also attacked the lawyers and the waste of legal fees of ATSIC or the land councils. What do you do if you are a land council and have a decision from a commission that says, `This land should go to you and a state administration'? There has hardly been a case&mdash;I think the attitude seems to be changing now, because we have recently had at least one or two propositions where there has been agreement&mdash;where the state has gone off to the High Court. Does the land council say, `We can't spend any money on that; we won't go'? Millions of dollars have been wasted in challenging decisions that have been upheld time and time again with respect to grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to bleat about the problem of alcoholism in Aboriginal communities&mdash;and it is a problem&mdash;but when Aboriginal communities go to the relevant state tribunal and say, `Please don't build a takeaway in this complex close to our community, it will bring problems of alcoholism,' do they succeed?

As long as the coalition sees itself as being responsive to the pressures of state conservative administrations, whose records in these areas are hopeless in many ways, there will never be the maturity of approach that this parliament so desperately needs if it is going to advance the needs of our Aboriginal and indigenous people. </PARA>

If we are running, say, 100,000 head there and turning off 20,000 head a year at $500 a head, you have got an income to the Lockhart River community of 400 to 500 people of $10 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you extrapolate that across the gulf and peninsula where the vast proportion of this land is, I think it is reasonable to say that an income of $40 million or $50 million a year should be able to be generated from cattle production. That should make these people some of the wealthiest people on the planet. As a geographical group, the people of Aboriginal descent living in the gulf and peninsula country of Queensland should be the richest people on earth. There is a hell of a lot of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been mustering on many occasions with people of Aboriginal descent. They enjoy a reputation for being arguably the best horsemen in the world. They are certainly some of the best cattlemen and stockmen in the world. They are people who know and can handle cattle. Having said all of these things, it would appear from the recent studies&mdash;not that I need the studies to tell me this&mdash;that we are dealing here with some of the poorest people on earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the amount of money that comes out of this parliament and the other parliaments of Australia, each family consisting of a husband, a wife and two kids should be entitled to an income of a little over $50,000 a year. Clearly, these people are not getting anything remotely like $50,000 a year. Not only is the money that has been allocated not getting to them but also we have the problem with this huge land resource which should be yielding tens of millions of dollars a year but is yielding virtually nothing. I venture to submit that, if you took the number of cattle being carried on all of that land some 20 years ago and compared it with the number of cattle on that land today, you would find that the numbers have dropped very significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was speaking to Nelson Gaviner, a very experienced cattleman on Mornington Island, who said, `I would be very keen for you to get us some cattle. We used to run about 2,000 head here, but now we are running nothing'. I spoke to Clarence Waldron at very great length the other evening. He has been a long-serving chairman, off and on, at Doomadgee. He said they have virtually no cattle whatsoever at Doomadgee whereas they used to have nearly 3,000 head of cattle there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is happening out there? This is a bit ironic, but the other day I rang about the sale of a property which, if it did not go through, was going to cost us all the training for all our kids of Aboriginal descent in the gulf and peninsula. I pleaded for the purchase of this station which would keep our training project going to train young men of Aboriginal descent as cattlemen in the gulf and peninsula&mdash;Jeff Guest's operation. Terry O'Shane of the ATSIC council in Cairns was most reluctant to go along with the purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It absolutely amazes me that in this place we keep passing laws that have absolutely nothing to do with the reality that exists out there on the ground. The reality is that every time you buy another station you create another black hole that will cost an absolute fortune to prop up and maintain. Now I represent the outback, the bush murris if you like. I do not represent city people, but the city people quite rightly are whingeing and screaming because all the money is going sideways into purchasing increasingly more land which will cost ever increasing amounts of money to prop up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to be a factor that has escaped the notice of the people in this place that a large proportion, if not the preponderance, of cattle stations in the state of Queensland are not running at a real profit. If an owner operator whose family for many generations, maybe for three generations, has experience in running a commercial business in rural station management cannot make a living out of it, then heaven only knows that people with very little education or very little business experience will find it very difficult to turn a quid out of these operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More important are the magic words, `development funds'. William Wentworth, one of the finest and one of the very few really good ministers for Aboriginal affairs, so I think anyway, was the person responsible for setting up the Aboriginal development corporation when money was allocated for economic development. Jackson Shortjoe, who has been chairman on and off for the last 10 years, I suppose, of what is now called Pormpuraaw, at the very first meeting when we decided to go for self-management or local government, if you like, said, `I don't know whether we can handle it; we haven't had an education'. A lot of people there said, `We can't handle local government'. But Jackson Shortjoe said, `I have to say to the meeting that we gotta do it, and the reason we gotta do it is because unless we get our pride back we are finished. Nothing else matters except getting our pride back'. That pride is not going to come back unless these people can stand on their own two feet and tell this parliament to go and jump in the lake. When they can stand on their own two feet they don't need to be in a mendicant relationship with the rest of Australia or, most certainly, with the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to the central theme of my contribution to the parliament of Australia today. With this huge land resource, when we are the most land-rich people on earth with 40-inch rainfall areas and all these things, why are these people today still living in what I would describe as relative poverty? Let me quote the same Clarence Waldron the other night. We were meant to have a meeting at six o'clock but, when Cloncurry meets Doomadgee, we are most certainly on island time. We ended up meeting at about 10 o'clock and going through to about two o'clock in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will quote Clarence verbatim. He said, `It's no bloody use to us because we can't get any money, we can't mortgage it, and if you can't get any money to develop it, what the hell use is it to you? You can take it back.' And he said, `You can't sell it, you can't give it to your kids. We don't own it.' He may have remembered that speech by Norm Johnson, who in Queensland could be described very much as an Aboriginal activist, a person who is very aggressive in his views and very uncompromising. Clarence may have been remembering a speech I heard given by Norm Johnson at Doomadgee when he said, `We don't own this land. If you can't sell it, you can't mortgage it and you can't bequeath it to your kids. You don't own it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the last speaker, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). Most of what he said was very sensible, but he referred to Uluru. Mr Norm Johnson&mdash;not me&mdash;a black person, very much an aggressive activist said, `Does anyone think for one moment that we own Uluru?' There was a huge roar of laughter from the crowd because nobody there for one moment thought that the black people own Uluru. They have no say in it, they have no involvement with it, they have nothing. Regardless of the tiny bit of money that comes out of it&mdash;it might not be; it might be a significant amount of money&mdash;in no sense do they own that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Norm Johnson's speech sticks in my mind. He said, `If you can't will it to your kids, if you can't mortgage it, if you can't sell it, then you don't own it.' That week there was a landmark article in the international magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> talking about Russia. It said that for the first time in Russian history, a Russian owns his own land. Russia went out of the feudal system, where the feudal lords owned the land, into a communist system where the government owned the land, and for the first time in all of Russian history a Russian actually owns his own land because he can sell it, he can mortgage it and he can leave it to his kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exactly the same expression was used by Norm Johnson at Doomadgee and the same expression was used by Clarence Waldron. But I could see that clearly when I was Aboriginal affairs minister. We had all of this land but the banks would not give you any money for it unless the government guaranteed it&mdash;and I daresay it would be a brave government that would guarantee any lending to any rural occupations at the present moment. If you could not get it from borrowings, you had to get it from government grants. When you had a choice of giving money to the people of Pomparau to buy some cattle or using the money for health and housing, the priority was always given to health and housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we keep putting bandaids on the sores&mdash;we keep treating the manifestations of the disease without coming to grips with its causes. The cause of the disease is no money for development. Heaven only knows, with the land mass that the people have at the present moment, imagine what would happen if you gave them a bit of money and private ownership incentive to go with it. At the moment, they enjoy a communist mechanism where the government or the council owns the land. The same success story that operates in the land mass in Queensland, unfortunately, operates in the communist states of the world because that is the nature of ownership in all of this land mass. If we switched to a private ownership regime, what could be achieved would be amazing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote the classic case, which <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> did an excellent story on, of Eddie Holroyd at Pormpuraaw. When the Queensland government was running Pormpuraaw, the maximum number of cattle mustered on the station was 360 head. We had some of the best stockmen we could lay our hands on but they had no incentive to go out and get the cattle in. So the maximum amount of money we were able to get out of Pormpuraaw was that from the sale of 360 head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eddie Holroyd was given a small piece of country of his own up there and the right to put cattle on it. He now has over 2,000 head of cattle on it. That is just one man with his own resources. Because he has private ownership he could borrow a little bit of money, but it was only about $50,000 or $60,000. All that could buy you would be a four-wheel drive vehicle, and that was about all he got with the money he was able to borrow. But he scraped and scratched and got some money for fencing and he now has 2,000 branded head of cattle behind wire on a place that the state government ran for some 30 or 40 years and where the most number of cattle it was able to get in was 360 head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a tremendously successful and outstanding story. You would think that it would create the model for the rest of Australia.

But what happened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incoming ALP government in Queensland reversed the legislation so that local people could not own the land. The legal and beneficial ownership reverted to the Crown. We have gone back to a reserve situation where the state government owns all of the land mass.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That theft of seven million acres by the ALP government in 1990 precipitated the worst riot in Queensland's parliamentary history, and quite rightly so. That action in itself was bad enough but taking place here today is yet another towering stupidity like the native title legislation, which delivered to the people no ownership of land. In fact, Queensland dispossessed the bulk of the Aboriginal population. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the original ATSIC legislation came forward, I spoke to Eric Law, who was, I suppose, effectively the head of the Aboriginal affairs department in Queensland.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill 1994 stems from the aftermath of the Mabo decision, of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his Redfern speech in December 1992 commented:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By doing away with the bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans, Mabo establishes a fundamental truth and lays the basis for justice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nation as a whole must remain diminished unless and until there is an acknowledgment of and retreat from past injustices.</PARA>
<PARA>As we are aware, that decision has led to a government strategy on three fronts: the native title legislation; this bill in relation to a land fund; and the future question of social justice for Aboriginals on a variety of fronts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the opposition speakers during this debate have been at pains to stress the very dire situation of Aboriginals in this country, essentially saying that giving them land will not solve that. I do not think that most of us need to be reminded of that dire situation. It is interesting to note in the recently launched <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Atlas of the Australian People</EMPHASIS>, which makes some very nice comments about every ethnic group that has arrived in this country, construing statistics in such a fashion that the best possible characteristics are derived. But it can say only this of the Aboriginal condition in 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stark social, demographic and economic contrasts between Australia's Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations reflect the former's marginal and deprived situation. Their very youthful age structure reflects the higher level of fertility and mortality than that recorded by the total population. It is also apparent that the Aboriginal population has a much lower rate of home ownership, lower incomes, greater unemployment, lower participation in high-status occupations, lower qualifications and greater proportions of single-parent families. These indicators reflect the profound inequalities between Aborigines and the rest of the population. They point to the deprivation which characterises a high proportion of the community and highlight the need for broad, wide ranging programs.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clearly understood on both sides of this House that the condition of Aborigines in this country is one of extreme hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised at the opposition putting such heavy emphasis on that condition because, fundamentally, that condition derives from a variety of activities by both parties in state governments around this country and, more particularly, by local government. In New South Wales we see fanciful distinctions made in regard to Aboriginal areas. We are told that they are not covered by local government. We are also told that a shire council cannot put a road into a certain area because there are some technicalities as to ownership. It is a fundamental problem in this country that these matters have not been tackled at a state or municipal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite a number of opposition members have been more active on this issue and have taken a greater interest in it than I, but it is obvious that they are forced to go along with a policy approved by a majority of their colleagues. The opposition view is summarised by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) who spoke of this legislation being `flawed'. Mr Fischer said that the opposition gave an unequivocal commitment that it would get rid of this legislation. He said that was the only way to fix this piece of bad federal law-making. On 2 March the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Aboriginal affairs has to be addressed within the concept of a single, undivided nation of which all Australians, whether indigenous Australians or other Australians, are treated equally, governed by a common set of laws to which all of us are equally accountable and governed by a number of common values.</PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that the conditions being suffered by Aboriginals&mdash;which have been emphasised by so many members of the opposition&mdash;are not solved by treating them similarly to everyone else in this country. We have to consider their distribution throughout the country, the areas they live in and their current situation. Because of this we have to have special measures enacted. </PARA>

The council is receiving $1 million a year in rent. There are significant indications throughout the state of new industries, particularly in rural areas, commenced from funding under this legislation. We have evidence of long overdue housing being built in fairly remote rural areas. Despite the problems of accountability that have existed in this fund during the early years, it is interesting to note that in his report last year the New South Wales Auditor-General said that after several years of heavy losses, and with the need for further improvement, there had been a very sustained improvement in the accountability of the organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard great fanfare in New South Wales. This legislation was the worst thing in the world when the Liberals were in opposition in New South Wales. When they came to power they were going to abolish it. They said it was dreadful. But in 1995, when faced with public reaction to any move to abolish this legislation, when they had the opportunity to speak to the land councils to see what was being done, they found that the changes had been marginal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the opposition have come to recognise&mdash;this is one of the problems for the opposition&mdash;that there is a degree of disunity in their response to this matter. A large number of members over there know that land is fundamental to the Aboriginal community. A large number of opposition members, both here and in the states, understand that Aboriginals have a special relationship with land. What is the logic in saying, as the opposition has proposed in these amendments, if we are giving this land because it was taken off them and because it was seized by us, that each and every Aboriginal around this country can individually go and flog it off? This is an attempt by the Australian people to resolve the aftermath of the occupation, the dispossession, the fact they were kicked off their land, their families broken up and their children taken off them. It is not an attempt to resolve the social problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said that the third phase in the aftermath of Mabo will be a social justice package. It is interesting to note that there has been a degree of cooperation between the federal government and the state government in New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) cited statistics about the degree to which, particularly in Queensland, there has been a strong trend away from rural and outback areas to urban and smaller country towns. He noted that in Queensland between 1986 and 1991 there was a 44 per cent increase in the urban population of Aboriginals, a 13 per cent increase in smaller urban areas and only a two per cent increase in rural areas. The reality is that a large number of Aboriginals in this country, the vast majority, will probably not be able to launch a direct personal claim on particular land&mdash;that they have got some connection with it, that they have continued to be close to it, that they have actually been there and that their families have been there. They will not have that opportunity under the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is an attempt to give the rest of those people some stake in land. We have seen, despite the comments of the opposition, a fairly constructive approach by the government. The opposition and the Greens in the Senate came up with 65 amendments, from recollection, of which the government accepted as many as 21. But what the government cannot do is agree to a series of amendments that basically constrain, limit and, in essence, undermine the whole intention of the land fund bill. One of the crucial amendments is the concept that individuals should get ownership. Another one is that the indigenous land councils should sit around having cups of coffee for about six hours every day debating and arguing, and having other people intervening and coming to some conclusion, about which Aboriginals are the most dispossessed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental difference between the parties is the opposition's view that this money is more appropriately spent in the delivery of education, health, water, et cetera. This is not the intention of the legislation. It is very much directed towards building up an adequate level of land stock and, by dedicating a very significant amount of the funds devoted each year over the next 10 years to non-land sale purposes, building up enough income in the fund so that it can operate in the way it is meant to be operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response from the opposition has been, `We don't really agree with this legislation. We are concerned about the possibility of a double dissolution. We don't fundamentally associate ourselves with the legislation.' The reality is, as we have seen in New South Wales, that as time goes on the parties will not be dictated to by a small rump from the National Party. The trend, as we have seen in New South Wales, is for people to come to accept the dire situation of the Aboriginals in this country. The value of this land fund will lead in the long term to its acceptance by the opposition. </PARA>

Further, an indigenous land corporation director or staff member is not required to provide that information in a court of law. Proposed section 193S of the bill prohibits the disclosure of any information or the production of any document by indigenous land corporation directors or staff that is sacred or otherwise significant to indigenous people, or where disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of indigenous people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not quite sure where the coalition stands on that issue because its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy was completely repealed by the former opposition leader, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and because of the failure of the member for Hindmarsh to produce the coalition's new policy by November last year, which she repeatedly promised on the public record to do. Because of that failure, we do not know whether the coalition supports that provision in the Northern Territory land rights act.

He wants to introduce quite separate issues that have been raised at another time and discuss the handling of those issues. I think it is quite inappropriate at this stage, when the debate is winding up, to introduce new material which would only unnecessarily extend the debate and which would be the subject of very severe contest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to place on record my very clear view and conclusion that, as a result of the conduct of the member for Hindmarsh, who is the opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, she has put herself and the coalition in a totally untenable position. Her complicity in the activities of the member for Barker and her active defence of the conduct of the member for Barker make it impossible for her to ever gain the confidence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In the unlikely event that the coalition were ever to win government, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people could have no confidence that the member for Hindmarsh would deal properly with them and show proper respect for Aboriginal culture and traditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indisputable that the member for Hindmarsh has actively collaborated with the member for Barker in his baseless attack on me over highly secret and sacred Aboriginal women's information which was improperly opened and copied by his office. The member for Hindmarsh was part of a tactical tag team that directed a series of questions to me in the parliament on this matter on Monday. The member for Hindmarsh collaborated with the member for Barker, despite knowing that he had a copy of the secret and sacred material and that this would cause great grief to Aboriginal people. An Aboriginal woman closely connected with this matter, Doreen Kartinyeri, made this clear this morning when she spoke on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making some very important remarks in the debate on the land fund bill when I was interrupted by a number of points of order taken by the coalition. I want to make it clear that my remarks are in direct response to matters raised during the debate on this bill by the member for Hindmarsh in which she criticised me and accused me of lying, of being incompetent and misleading. Not only do I have a right to respond to those matters but also, as a minister, I have an obligation to respond to them in the course of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point I was making when I was interrupted is that the position of the member for Hindmarsh as the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs has become absolutely untenable. There is no alternative but for the Leader of the Opposition to sack her from her position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The fact is that the member for Hindmarsh was part of a tactical tag team series of questions to me in the parliament on this matter on Monday. The member for Hindmarsh collaborated with the member for Barker, despite knowing that he had copied the secret and sacred material and that this would cause great grief to Aboriginal women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already outlined a number of the series of questions that were raised by this tag team operation of the member for Barker and the member for Hindmarsh. It was during the third question that the member for Barker threw down on the table what he said was the envelope containing the secret and sacred material of the Aboriginal women. Knowing that, the member for Hindmarsh then rose in this place and asked me to explain where, other than my office, the material could have come from and to give an assurance that no non-Aboriginal male had read the material. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Knowing full well, as the member interjects, the history of this matter. The member for Hindmarsh clearly knew, in relation to the McLachlan affair, that the member for Barker's staff had intercepted my mail and copied the secret and sacred material and other material then involved in the Hindmarsh Island court case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the parliament and the people of Australia that the envelope containing the secret and sacred women's information was clearly marked `Confidential&mdash;Appendices 2 and 3, to be read only by women'. Yet the member for Hindmarsh conspired with him in conduct which I believe is a gross violation of the rights of Aboriginal women and has caused great hurt to them, as they have already made clear on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Hindmarsh has not uttered one word of criticism of the member for Barker. In fact, she has actively and publicly defended his actions, including voting with him on the floor of this parliament. By her conduct, the member for Hindmarsh has resorted to the old coalition tactic of attempting to use Aboriginal affairs as a party political football, irrespective of the hurt caused to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By working hand in glove with the member for Barker, she has irrevocably destroyed any hope of gaining the respect and confidence of Aboriginal people. In the interests of progressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues in this parliament and in the public, the member for Hindmarsh should immediately be sacked from her front bench position by the Leader of the Opposition. In saying that, I know that I have not only the support of my party but also the support of many fair-minded Australians in both the Aboriginal and the non-Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continuing the rest of my remarks in relation to the land fund bill, one consistent theme has been raised by the coalition in the course of debate about the land fund bill and that is that, somehow or other, this government is not determined to address a wider agenda of indigenous social justice issues. I want to use my concluding remarks on this bill to highlight the commitment that the government has to address Aboriginal health issues as a very high priority of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To do that I can do no better than refer to the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he spoke to the Hopevale Aboriginal community at Cape York in Far North Queensland. The Prime Minister spoke with a very clear understanding of the dimensions of that issue. He spoke about the interrelationship between infrastructure issues and the need for water, sewerage and housing in those communities to address the fundamental root causes of poor standards of health. He went on to say, in what I think is an historic contribution to public debate in this country, that the commitment of this government is to progress reconciliation. He made it clear that the government had sought to do that, step by step. He talked about the big picture and about the government's achievements. He said, `Of course we have done Mabo and the land fund,' and he went on to say, `And now health, and with that comes environmental issues&mdash;housing, sewerage, et cetera.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do not have from the coalition, of course, is any policy at all in respect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. That policy, like all the rest of coalition policy on Aboriginal health, was buried in the sands of the central Australian desert on the occasion of the visit of the former Leader of the Opposition to that country. A promised policy review of the coalition scheduled for release in November is still not here almost six months later. There is literally not one word of coalition policy on health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will no doubt be continuing debates on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy. As I said in the debate on the earlier bill in relation to the land fund, it is not my wish that this area of social policy become the subject of bitter party political point scoring. The events of the last 24 and 48 hours are not of my making. As I made it clear the other day, and I make it clear again, if the opposition wishes to launch personal attacks, wishes to use Aboriginal affairs as a party political football, then of course the government has to stand and will rise to defend the human rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people against those attacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In finalising my comments on the bill I want again to put this legislation in context. I do not wish to retrace the long and I think sorry history of the way that the Australian parliament has dealt with this legislation. In every sense of the word history will judge the conduct of parties and of individuals as this legislation is progressed through the House. But the fact is that the end result, because of the switch in policy by the coalition, is that this legislation will pass through this House with the unanimous support of the chamber and then it will proceed to the Senate when I hope it will be given high priority passage by that chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the responsible minister, it is my objective to have the land fund up and running at the first available opportunity. It forms the second stage of the government's response to the historic decision of the High Court in the Mabo case. The first stage was the Native Title Act. I appeal to the coalition to include the Native Title Act in its review of Aboriginal affairs policy and to give its endorsement for the principles contained in that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former coalition minister, Ian Viner, at a meeting in the Lower Town Hall in the course of public debate on these issues said that this is a matter fundamentally about human rights and not states rights. We know the problem that the coalition has had with this issue. It has always been about questions of states rights. But that shift in coalition policy at this point in time is not likely to happen; the opposition maintains its commitment to repeal that legislation, and that is deeply regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House is the government's second stage response, but I remind the House that it is not the final stage. That will be in the form of a social justice package, and I know that there will be a great deal of public interest in and public discussion and consultation about that social justice package and proposals. It has already been discussed by the reconciliation council and by ATSIC, and reports will be forthcoming in the near future on those subjects. No doubt the opposition will be involved in that debate, I would hope constructively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this is the second stage of the government's response. It is something that I on this side of the House have believed in for a long time. Some of us have been working on this proposal for almost a decade. It is a very significant piece of human rights legislation that will profoundly advance the human rights of indigenous people. I commend the legislation to the House in the knowledge that it will pass through this chamber with unanimous support. </PARA>

In his speech winding up the debate, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) made some very serious allegations in relation to the shadow minister for environment and heritage, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan).

When you look at clause 191D, which deals with the land acquisition functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation, it does raise a number of matters relating to those functions and their terms and conditions, certain guarantees and their terms and conditions, and the performance of functions, which deals with the function of land acquisition.

That is an accepted function of every government authority. The parliament does not prescribe&mdash;I do not think it has ever prescribed&mdash;in legislation such matters of obvious responsibility that would be normally carried out in everyday activities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill is substantially the same as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995, which was introduced into the other place on 31 January 1995. That bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported to the Senate on 1 March 1995. A majority of the committee recommended that the bill be adopted but a number of the opposition senators who sat on the committee dissented and called for a delay in the passage of the bill and for non-specified amendments to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dissenting report of Senators Ellison, O'Chee and Abetz is based upon an inaccurate interpretation of the bill's provisions relating to the scope of the refugee convention ground of particular social group. The coalition senators remarked that the bill `seeks to disqualify those who have a well-founded fear of persecution just because they are the unfortunate victims of China's fertility control policy'. This has never been the intention nor the effect of the bill. As was made clear in the second reading speech and explanatory memorandum to the No. 3 bill, the bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing social group, or on any of the other convention grounds, who has a well-founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Senate committee's deliberations some submissions raised doubt about the operation of proposed sections 36(3) and 36(4). Amongst these submissions were those of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson. The Acting Solicitor-General's advice was obtained by the government. Following consideration of this advice and the totality of the evidence received by the committee, the government has drafted amendments which incorporate the abovementioned statements from the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum in the text of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will clarify the operation of the bill. Whilst many of the criticisms of the bill have been based on a misunderstanding of its purpose and effect, the government acknowledges the depth of concern held by many people on the sensitive issue of fertility control policies. However, the bill is not about the merits or otherwise of such policies. It is about the need to protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system, whilst at all times vigilantly observing our obligations under the Refugees Convention to provide protection to genuine refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has two purposes, both of which relate to the need to protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system. The bill's first purpose is to ensure that the fertility control policies of the government of a foreign country are disregarded in determining if a non-citizen is a member of a particular social group within the meaning of the Refugees Convention, as amended by the Refugees Protocol, for the purposes of considering an application for a protection visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was among the first to sign the Refugees Convention, and the Migration Act and our refugee determination system reflect the seriousness with which we take our obligations under the convention. The convention states that a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Useful though the ground of particular social group undoubtedly is, it is also the most difficult to define in practice. Assessment of whether a claimant is a member of a particular social group is usually left to those who administer and review our refugee determination system. However, the implication of the recent Federal Court judgment that a person may be recognised as a member of a particular social group simply because he or she is a person to whom the fertility control policies of a foreign government apply, or who objects to such policies, has such potentially serious consequences that the government has decided to introduce the current bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that the recent judgment dilutes the meaning of the convention ground of particular social group. The judgment has considerably expanded those who need to be considered by the refugee determination system. Many of the people who would now have to be considered as a result of the judgment are not normally regarded as refugees by other countries. Consequently, the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system is being threatened, which will in turn undermine public support for the discharge of Australia's international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To regard a large proportion of the population of China, or any country, as a social group and therefore as potential refugees simply on the basis of their government's fertility control policies is inconsistent with the intention of the convention to provide protection to refugees with a well-founded fear of persecution. One consequence of the inclusive nature of the Federal Court's decision is likely to be that those refugees who historically have been regarded as in genuine need of protection by Australia, and whose status should be determined quickly, will be disadvantaged as the system will have to deal with an increased number of applicants to whom the convention was not intended to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing this legislation I emphasise that the government is not questioning that the convention ground of particular social group is a useful and necessary concept. Indeed, the government is seeking to bring the application of this concept into line with our international obligations following the recent Federal Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated earlier, this bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a particular pre-existing social group, or on any of the other convention grounds, who has a well-founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person from a particular social group, such as a village or workplace, who is subjected to the rogue application of a fertility control policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under the legislation introduced today. Nor will a person who is a member of a particular religious, political or racial group subject to the persecutory application of fertility control policies be denied consideration of his or her claims under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned to address issues which might arise from gender based persecution, and has been working actively in this area for some time. For instance, our humanitarian program contains a specific women at risk component, which targets resettlement assistance to refugee women in particularly vulnerable situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government is concerned to ensure that the convention is interpreted correctly. This will ensure the retention of a public commitment to our refugee determination system, and the integrity and effectiveness of that system. Incorrectly diluting the meaning of `particular social group' under the convention has the potential to undermine that public confidence and the ability of our determinations system to do the job it was set out to do: to afford protection to genuine refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation introduced today will help to provide a common sense approach to the definition of a `particular social group' under the convention, by precluding the possibility of very large numbers of people, with nothing in common but that they may be affected in some way by the fertility control policies of their government, being caught within the definition of a social group under the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second purpose of this bill is to prevent a non-citizen from making further applications for a protection visa when he or she has already made an application, whether or not the prior application has been finally determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia operates one of the most thorough, efficient and equitable refugee determination systems in the world. A person's claim is assessed against the convention definition of a refugee and, if it is not accepted at the primary stage, the person may appeal to the independent Refugee Review Tribunal, which may reverse the primary decision. If a person's claim is still not accepted at the Refugee Review Tribunal stage, it is open to that person to seek review on administrative law grounds from the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under current legislation, when a person has exhausted this process, it is not difficult for that person to lodge another application for a protection visa and start the whole process again. The fact that repeat applications serve to delay the removal from Australia of the applicant has led to their increased use. The processing of these repeat applications&mdash;which, like the initial application, are free of charge to the applicant&mdash;is both expensive and time consuming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the system is fair and open and contains the right to appeal the primary decision, claimants will generally have no need to repeat the whole process to get a fair hearing. That fair hearing is amply provided by the system as it exists already. This bill, therefore, will have the effect of barring repeat applications in the majority of cases. Its intention in doing so is to protect the integrity of, and support for, Australia's refugee determination system, and to ensure that available resources are expended on claims for protection which have not yet been exhaustively assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing this bar on repeat applications, the government is aware that there will remain circumstances in which particular repeat applications may merit consideration. These cases are likely to include repeat applications which contain information which was not available to the claimant during the first application, and which is of a nature that is likely to have a real bearing on the assessment of the need for protection. Events in the country of origin of the claimant that have occurred since the first claim may also mean that a second consideration is warranted. The government has, therefore, decided that the minister will retain a discretion to allow particular repeat applications to be assessed by the full refugee determination process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the minister's non-compellable discretion may only be exercised by the minister personally, measures will be taken to ensure that all cases in which the minister might wish to exercise his or her discretion are identified and brought to the minister's attention. In such cases the minister will present to parliament the reasons for the exercise of his or her discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both aspects of the bill introduced today demonstrate the government's resolve to maintain a refugee determination system that is targeted towards those with a claim to Australia's protection under our Refugees Convention obligations. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that there are some 20 million refugees in the world today. Australia has an obligation to help these people through the most effective means at our disposal. We meet this obligation through our overseas aid program, our assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives, our humanitarian program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life, and through our onshore refugee determination system. When the need arises to defend these efforts and to maintain their credibility, public support and effectiveness, as in the present case, the government will do so. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) is a bill which would normally be introduced in the Senate. Today we have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), in her usual competent way, introducing a speech that has been written for her. It is a speech which puts the government's view as to why this bill should be supported. But I do wish to ask this very simple question: why was the bill introduced in this House when the minister who is responsible sits in another place? It is normally the case that migration bills are introduced into the other chamber and, if they are carried there, they proceed here for our concurrence. Why is it any different on this occasion?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why was it any different on the last occasion? These are bills that the government hopes it may be able to put to a base political purpose rather than a legitimate purpose in protecting the efficacy of our immigration program. If the government's only purpose was to maintain the efficacy of our migration program and the refugee determination process, this bill would have been introduced in the Senate, particularly as we had indicated that we were going to cooperate in its passage. But the government is thrashing around to find a bill that it might be able, because of some concerns that we have in relation to it, to use as a double dissolution bill. Of course, you cannot use it as a double dissolution bill if it does not go from the House of Representatives to the Senate. That is the reason. It is a base political purpose. The government here again, in an area which it says is beyond politics, is wanting to play politics. It ought to be understood that that is the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, why are we dealing with this matter again? We are dealing with this matter largely because this government has proved that it is incapable of effectively administering the law in relation to migration entry and refugee determination. I have some familiarity with this matter because I was previously shadow minister for immigration. It is a fact that the government was warned, when it went down the route of introducing into our framework of law the international covenants for determining who is or who is not a refugee, that there was the potential for those who are interested in the concept of administrative law and the courts in particular to be able to intrude and offer their judgments instead of the judgment of the government of the day being enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here with a situation in which a judge, in turning his mind to particular provisions of the international covenant, has come up with a view that the government finds does not meet its objectives; so it then has to try to alter the natural meaning of the words that have been imputed into the interpretation of the international covenant dealing with refugees and its protocols. The fact is that we are the first country, as I understand it, that is legislating to codify and clarify that international covenant. This is very significant. But the reason we are dealing with this matter at this time is that the government did not accept the advice that I previously offered. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary did not take much interest in those debates at that time, but the fact is that I counselled the government time and time again that there were two ways in which to deal with the determination process in relation to refugee status. The first was to deal with them administratively and the second was to follow the alternative course of the judicial route. I made it very clear that, if we were going to go down the route of having both administrative determination and judicial decision making, it was a disastrous route. It has led to interminable delays. It has put at risk the way in which Australia deals with this process of refugee determination. I think it has put at risk our reputation internationally. It has certainly had a very significant impact in Australia. And it is a situation of the government's own making. When it had the opportunity to amend the Migration Act and to take out of that act the capacity for judges, under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, to get involved in reconsidering these matters after they have been through the independent administrative review process that was put in place, an administrative decision making process involving an independent merits review body, the Refugee Tribunal, it failed to measure up in relation to that matter; it walked away from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are dealing with this matter now, where we are trying to further codify the process by which refugee decisions are determined, because the government failed to take these matters effectively out of the hands of the courts when it had the opportunity. The government has made it clear that it is seeking in this legislation&mdash;it comes through in the second reading speech&mdash;to substitute its own view on what constitutes a social group for determining the application of one ground, one element, of the decisions that need to be made in determining whether a person is or is not a refugee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international covenant makes it clear that there are two essential elements that have to be satisfied. The covenant reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted, for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, such a person is outside the county of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.</PARA>
<PARA>So you first of all establish that you have a well-founded fear of being persecuted. The second element is for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group. And so it is in relation to this question of whether or not a person is a member of a particular social group, and the meaning of those words, that the parliament is now legislating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to make it clear that the coalition supports the principle that the government now seeks to enshrine, namely, that China's one child policy should not of itself be a ground for the granting of refugee status in Australia on the basis of being a member of a social group. However, we have a number of concerns about the bill as it is drafted. Strong and legitimate concerns were voiced by many witnesses at the recent inquiry into the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995, the predecessor of a bill introduced properly into the Senate and considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. A number of my colleagues on that committee presented a dissenting report, which shared many of the concerns expressed by witnesses. I note that the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine also presented dissenting reports, which also relied on many of the views expressed by those witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has attempted to meet some of those concerns. The parliamentary secretary makes clear on the first page of her speech, so ably read, that during the Senate committee's deliberation some submissions raised doubts about the operation of proposed sections 36(3) and 36(4). Among those submissions was that of the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson. The Acting Solicitor-General's advice was obtained by the government and, because essentially the Acting Solicitor-General agreed that the government's bill was not likely to achieve its objective, the government has come to the view that it should draft further amendments, which are included in this bill today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not sure whether all of those concerns have been met. Obviously the government has tried to meet some of them. We will allow the bill to proceed through its normal process in this place&mdash;in other words, we will not be opposing it&mdash;but my colleague Senator Short in the other place will seek to negotiate amendments to address the legitimate concerns that have been raised. In particular, we believe that the government must ensure that persons whose fear of forced abortion or sterilisation is well founded are not automatically precluded from being able to make an application. The bill is not clear on this point, and we think that that needs to be made clear. We are confident that the government will share the concern and that basic human rights considerations would not allow Australia to force a pregnant woman, for example, to return to her country of origin if it were known that on return she would face a forced abortion. We therefore believe it will be possible to negotiate acceptable amendments to the bill, and it is on this basis that we will support its passage through this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's handling of the matter, as I have said, leaves a great deal to be desired. The parliamentary secretary is wanting to assert that the government's bill does achieve that objective. We need to be satisfied that that is the case. We are not in any way trying to demur from the general principle of the government that all women of child-bearing age who have one child in China ought to be able to access Australia if they are able to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. To do so would have a very significant influence on our capacity to help those who satisfy the general intention of the refugee convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our view that the legislation ought to narrow the meaning that was put on the words regarding what constitutes a social class by Justice Sackville, but we want to be satisfied that those concerns are met while ensuring that, first, the passage of this bill does not in any way imply acceptance of China's human rights or population control policies and, secondly, it is understood that we will continue our strong support for a significant refugee and humanitarian program, upholding the refugee convention&mdash;an approach that was taken by us in government and one that has been consistently put by us on refugee issues in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also make it clear that we think the bill as amended does take account of the main human rights concerns that have been expressed, but we have these remaining questions in our mind that we want to address, and it is particularly important that the Senate have the opportunity to turn its mind to these matters. I hope the government, as we press the matter in the Senate, will take a reasonable approach to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters that I want to raise. I was interested that in a lot of the discussion and in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech there have been introduced words that do not appear in the international covenant dealing with refugees. In paragraph 6 of her second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was made clear in the second reading speech and explanatory memorandum to the No. 3 bill, the bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing social group, or on any of the other convention grounds&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what is meant by the term `pre-existing social group'. It is interesting that, in the paper prepared by the parliamentary library, the writer obviously had a similar concern. I do not know whether we are intended to be able to quote these matters, but they are intended to offer advice to us that we might entertain in addressing a bill. A reference was made to a second reading speech to a bill previously involving Senator Ray, and it said in relation to this matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing social group or any of the other convention grounds&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the same words as we are using here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who has a well-founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person of a particular village or workplace who is subjected to a rogue application of fertility policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under legislation introduced today.</PARA>
<PARA>The writer says, `It is uncertain how a pre-existing group should be defined.' I would like the parliamentary secretary to simply define that for us. She uses the words in the second reading speech, and the term has been used before. What does she mean by `a member of a pre-existing group'? I think that is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to also ask, in relation to this matter, whether the government will also ensure that all of the advice that has been available to it in considering these matters will be available to the parliament. I notice that, in the dissenting report and the very useful end notes that Senator Harradine produced, he did raise a number of questions&mdash;including, I might say, the pre-existing social group question. On page 12 of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, in end note 23, there were some references to some of the opinions that have been offered. The government members were relatively happy with some of the opinions that were forthcoming but, in that end note, Senator Harradine refers to Mr Mowbray from the Attorney-General's department, whom he quotes as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Sackville decision, his finding on the particular social group was: parents with one child wishing to have another child, who are subjected to official incentives or sanctions designed to discourage them from acting upon their wishes.That was one formulation.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Harradine goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The suggestion by some that the effect of the Sackville judgment is that "China's one-child policy established refugee status for any fertile Chinese female who managed to land in Australia" has been formally repudiated by the Acting Registrar of the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department was asked to provide the Committee with its legal advice on the effect of the Sackville judgment. The only such legal advice was of five sentences in a half page memorandum from Mr Henry Burmester, Principal International Law Counsel, Attorney-General's Department . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The question needs to be asked as to whether that is the only opinion and, if there are other opinions, whether the parliament will be given the benefit of those to enhance its consideration of this matter. That is an important point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very genuine concerns about the Chinese policies, if you read a good deal of the evidence that was made available in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report, particularly in the dissenting report under note 28 where `witness B', as I understand it, a gynaecologist who had experience in China, raised some very alarming concerns about near-term pregnancies being aborted, a practice I believe to be very close to infanticide. Such matters would be of concern to us all. As has been made very clear in a lot of the material I have read in terms of what constitutes persecution, China's birth policies, without amending what constitutes a social class, would constitute persecution per se. Very clearly, what happens in China is, by any understanding of the term, persecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I indicate that we will not be demurring in relation to the second element of this legislation to ensure that people cannot continue to bring endless refugee applications. Repeat applications, which serve only to delay removal from Australia of an applicant, are something that cannot be entertained. The misuse of a very important process and one which is time consuming and very expensive is something that cannot be sustained. It is surprising, in view of the evidence that has come to light, that this matter has not been previously dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the assurance of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) that, with regard to the minister's non-compellable discretion, which may be exercised only by the minister personally, measures will be taken to ensure that all cases on which the minister might wish to exercise his discretion are identified and brought to the minister's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very interesting statement was made in the second reading speech, because I would like to know what the criteria might be for determining which matters would be brought to the minister's attention&mdash;in other words, how somebody might enter into the minister's mind to establish what is relevant to when he would want to exercise his discretion. It would be very interesting to see how relevant criteria are developed for that purpose. I would certainly like to hear the parliamentary secretary explain that because it is clear that there is a concern about that discretion. It is meant to be the remedy of last resort, and we would certainly want a clear statement&mdash;from the parliamentary secretary if it is possible at this stage, and certainly from the minister if the parliamentary secretary is not in a position to do it&mdash;that the minister will exercise his non-compellable discretion under the Migration Act with respect to persons who may not fall within the refugee convention definition of refugee, because of the social class amendment which we are pressing, but who are nevertheless clearly at genuine risk of persecution through forced abortion or sterilisation. That is an assurance that we would want to have from the parliamentary secretary. I am sure that this is a matter that the parliamentary secretary, given her own background and experience, would be very concerned to have addressed. Those who gave evidence before the Senate committee would also certainly want to have that clarification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the opposition is very concerned about the ad hoc administration of immigration policy. Amendments are constantly being made. This is amendment bill No. 4 for this year. Litigation is constantly occurring, and frequently the department is unsuccessful. That reflects upon the nature of the advice that the government is getting. It reflects upon the legislative drafting skills in this area. It certainly indicates a significant degree of incompetence. My colleague Senator Short has made it very clear that, because of the shortcomings that have been emerging, an investigation is needed into the way in which the department is administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in government, the opposition will undertake a thorough review, through an independent inquiry, of the operation of the Migration Act. Since this massive codification has occurred, the implications have been significant. The codification, the commitment of the government to administrative review in all circumstances and its unwillingness to amend the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act have led to this situation. It is a very real concern which the government must address. </PARA>

A few scattered guns, a few rogue senators in the opposition, have decided to attempt to take over the opposition's policy on migration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, a few people with a studied disinterest in the threat to this country's migration policies stroll around the place finding legalisms and arguments as to why the government's policy should not be supported. The spokesman opposite, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), made some very valid points with regard to the question of access to administrative law and the judiciary. Many members on this side of the House have some sympathy with those points. However, we have no sympathy with the interference with and the harassment of this legislation by those senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is saying that it will now pass this legislation. Admittedly, an important amendment has been made to make it clear that, in the case of those people who are members of a very defined group, China's fertility policies will be a consideration in refugee assessment. The government has stated that it will take on board the instances supplied by the opposition spokesman with regard to pregnant Chinese women and the threat to them individually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sense of realism is prevailing in this House today in regard to opposition policy, which is certainly not the case in the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As people would be aware, essentially, this legislation is about the decision by Justice Sackville and its impact on the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees, where it speaks of a refugee as a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group&mdash;the one that is most at issue here&mdash;or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. We have witnessed a major widening by Justice Sackville of the meaning of `social group'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, he is saying&mdash;unfortunately a few Liberal Party and National Party senators agree with him&mdash;that if you are under 55 and you are a family member of a couple in China then you should be given access to Australia's refugee system, that that is a defined social group. Obviously, anyone with commonsense knows that that was not the intention of those that sought to give protection to people around the world in the late 1940s and early 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will members of the opposition say next? Will they agree with the spurious claims that we are already seeing coming through our system from every second woman from Tonga who lands in Australia that she comes from a male dominated society and, therefore, should be accorded refugee status?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing that will happen, if opposition senators have their way, will be the claim that all of these groups should be given refugee status in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of this case&mdash;unreported case No. 327 of 1994&mdash;has been an extremely serious attack upon the legitimacy of the refugee policy of this country. Justice Sackville commented about a `non-consensual procedure which altered a person's reproductive capacity as an act of persecution'. On page 8, he spoke of a social group including `those who, having only one child, do not accept the limitations placed on them, or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My knowledge of the case is that the two individuals concerned did not come with a clear case that they had personally been subjected to certain practices, that they had been picked upon and that they came from a region where it was, specifically, even a rogue application of policy. Essentially, they were two Chinese people who said, `We don't like China's one child policy.' Justice Sackville said, `You're part of a social group' and implied that so were hundreds of millions of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is an attempt to get back to the intentions of the original refugee provisions to ensure that we are talking about people who are part of a defined, obvious, patently existing social group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a variety of cases about this matter. One that goes to part of the reality is Sanchez v. Escobar, decision No. 85-7609. It relates to the situation in El Salvador. In that case the protocols were going towards a similar pattern with far more relevance but, despite the greater strength of that case, they were rejected as well. Because of the nature of the civil war and the repressive paramilitary practices in El Salvador there was a threat to young urban males. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That case goes to the question of what a social group is. The judge stated that the definition `is a flexible one which extends broadly to encompass many groups who do not otherwise fall within the other categories of race, nationality, religion or political opinion'. He said, however, `the scope of the term cannot be without some limit' and that it was not meant to cover `a plethora of different lifestyles, varying interests, diverse cultures, and contrary political leanings'. In other words, young urban males in El Salvador was too broad a group to be intentionally covered by the 1951 refugee protocols. Finally, the following statement was made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of central concern is the existence of a voluntary associational relationship . . . which imparts some common characteristic that is fundamental to identity as a member of that discrete social group.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Sackville has done&mdash;and what a lot of Liberal senators seem to think is a good idea&mdash;is throw open the doors to an avalanche of claims by people who do not like the policy.

If people cannot succeed at the Refugee Review Tribunal they can go to the Federal Court. There is no cost to the applicant in many parts of this system. Under this current bogus section, people can claim to have new material and thus launch another application, essentially with minimal changes in their stories.

The first reason for concern, especially in my electorate where we have a high percentage of people who have come from overseas to live in Australia and who probably have relatives or friends or other family members who are in the process of applying for immigration, is that at the same time as this particular problem is surfacing in the community there has been a very stringent tightening of entry requirements for migration applicants. Of course, that has meant that in some instances people have been disappointed in the result of the applications of their own relatives to migrate to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were very heartily upset by the almost unilateral corruption of the refugee program by Prime Minister Hawke following the Tiananmen Square massacre and by the consequent visa grants to students from the People's Republic of China.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also note the parliamentary secretary is intervening again. I do not know how many thousands of kilometres of the coastline of Western Australia are in the member opposite's electorate, but it certainly has a large coastline. One of the other major factors that have given rise to this community concern is the poor surveillance of Australia's northern coastline. That has become quite clear during the term of the present government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern is the inordinate delays in the seemingly ad hoc changes to procedures relating to illegal entrants into Australia. It is another matter that sends out some very confusing and unfortunate signals to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share entirely the views expressed by the member for Berowra about the earlier advice, which is the same advice as the previous minister for immigration, Mr Hand, gave during a debate at which I was present and contributed to, which is that there ought to be a more administrative procedure in relation to the treatment of illegal entrants and a very substantial reduction in the opportunity to resort to the courts. Resorting to the courts is clearly seen by many in the community as being unhelpful and does not contribute to our healthy and rational debate. In many instances, it also means that people suspect there is an opportunity to prolong one's stay in Australia by using the courts over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community expects the following from the refugee program in Australia: a humane but swift assessment of the potential refugee status of those who are applying; in particular, the speedy return of those who fail that assessment. It is self-evident that the community accepts that, by necessity, Australia is participating in the refugee program. However, it expects that participation to include the speedy return of those who fail the assessment of refugee status and, as I said earlier, a much swifter assessment of those who are applying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of a swifter and fair but firm assessment of refugee claimants sends some important signals to the rest of the world, in particular to many in our region. The first is that some integrity has been restored to the refugee program, and the second is that those who are waiting in the queue for assessment elsewhere within the region&mdash;such as in camps in South-East Asia&mdash;are not being jumped over by people who can make it to Australia by sea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with this issue&mdash;and, in the first instance, I am tackling the whole question of the refugee policy&mdash;it is very important that these clear and distinct signals are sent to the areas where we can see a potential source of illegal entrants. It should be made clear that, when those who undertake what is in some instances a quite perilous journey to get here, they will be treated in a humane but swift and firm way in relation to their credentials for acceptance as refugees but, if they fail that assessment, they will be sent back to their source country as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, you and I in a previous time&mdash;I think in 1990&mdash;debated from different sides of the chamber the question of population control measures. We have differences of opinion on population control. I think the federal government is entirely hypocritical on this bill. In the past it has actively supported, in a material way, coercive population measures within the People's Republic of China. As you and I both know, there was a contribution by Australia towards the provision of ultrasound equipment which was alleged to have been used in the detection of illegal pregnancies. The cynical attempt of this bill to manipulate legitimate community concerns, as I have indicated in the case of my constituent's petition, is thoroughly shameful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) referred to senators who participated in the inquiry of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The question which still has not been answered is why the minister did not await a full bench hearing in the Sackville decision of the Federal Court. Why the seeming hurry to ram this legislation through the parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The member for Berowra has stated the coalition's position on this matter. The coalition will allow the bill to proceed according to normal due process but will negotiate amendments which go as far as possible towards addressing the legitimate concerns that have been raised, while recognising that not all of those concerns are likely to be fully satisfied. Assuming that we can negotiate some reasonable amendments in the Senate, there is some confidence that the bill will be allowed to be passed. But, in doing so, there are a number of things that we must make absolutely clear. First of all, the allowance of the passage of the bill does not in my way imply acceptance of China's human rights or population control policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Reid quoted from the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the migration legislation amendment bill. He made the observation that, in some way, some of the coercive population control measures are not official policy and are in fact rogue applications of these measures in specific areas. The interesting submission was No. 8 from Steven Mosher, an expert witness, who stated that directives of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did represent government policy and de facto law and did embrace forced abortion or sterilisation as a matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned by the member for Berowra, the testimony of witness B, the person who had been a gynaecologist working within that program, is quite distressing. I imagine that it would be particularly distressing for feminists because of the program's quite clear coercion or intimidation of the female section of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that one of the most staunch critics of the Chinese policy is Dr Lynette Dumble, who as many would know is a prominent feminist health expert or commentator. Her view, which has been well expounded in recent times, is that if the programs undertaken within China were to be repeated even in a mild way in this country we would have streets filled with people marching in protest. The difficulty in a sense is that acceptance of a particular policy in relation to one set of people implies a certain inverted racism in that somehow the rights of the women in China who were forced to undertake compulsory sterilisation or abortion measures are in some way inferior. That is not to say necessarily that that should be an automatic reason for those particular people to be considered as refugees for entry into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I mentioned earlier, it is important that in allowing the passage of this bill we make it absolutely clear that we oppose and abhor the use of coercive sterilisation or birth control measures within the People's Republic of China. The work undertaken and the observations made on this matter by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee&mdash;particularly those senators who signed minority reports&mdash;do not deserve condemnation. In fact, they deserve the praise and thanks of all concerned. After all, if we criticise fiercely some of the policies undertaken in the 1930s in Nazi Germany on eugenics&mdash;as we have done in this parliament time and again&mdash;we ought to be consistent. We ought to make it absolutely clear that we abhor the equally inhumane policies, whether they are applied in a roguish manner&mdash;as has been alleged&mdash;or are part of a centrally driven policy program of the Chinese Communist Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If in any way the Chinese authorities responsible for this take comfort from the passing of this legislation, this parliament should make it absolutely clear that they ought not to. We ought to make it absolutely clear that we thoroughly condemn those practices and would work towards making sure they end. The honourable member for Reid mentioned, for instance, taxation and other population measures. I do not think anybody on this side of the chamber would object to the use of financial incentives to try to achieve a rational population policy within the People's Republic of China. </PARA>

I think the honourable member for Reid is still a very prominent member of Friends of East Timor, which is a group that tries to work towards improving human rights for the citizens of East Timor. If we are going to have any position on human rights, we ought to be consistent and work towards a better standard of human rights for those unfortunate enough to be the subjects of coercive population control measures within the People's Republic of China.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is strange that, in some instances, some prominent human rights activists have been strangely mute on this point. I know there is a very strong Tibet friendship group within this parliament led, I think, by Senator Loosley from the Labor Party. There have been similar types of population control measures used within Tibet and they are also deserving of the thorough condemnation of members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear&mdash;I think the member for Kalgoorlie will probably agree with me&mdash;that there has to be a tightening up of our immigration policy and our refugee program. In particular, there needs to be a thorough review of the Migration Act, particularly since the massive codification of immigration policy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In particular, we must see a movement away from the ad hoc knee-jerk responses in relation to particular situations as they arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra has been consistent right throughout his parliamentary career on this matter. If honourable members were to look through the parliamentary records, they will see that some people have not been consistent. Importantly, during his tenure as a shadow minister for immigration and again today, the member for Berowra made it absolutely clear&mdash;I recall those debates because they were at a time when there was a blazing row between the then chairman of the caucus committee and the minister&mdash;that it is really time this process is administered with as little opportunity for intervention in the courts as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is quite consistent with the desires and the wishes of the majority of Australians. Australians are by nature a humane and rational society. They are, and have been for a long time, willing participants in the refugee program. They have strong humanitarian instincts. Australians, by virtue of our fair and open society, view some of the things that I have been talking about in a distressed way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, there has to be a rational, fair and firm system in the refugee program&mdash;not an ad hoc, knee-jerk mixture of applications of policy. This government deserves some condemnation for the way in which the bill has been going backwards and forwards. I note that there are still some very serious concerns with the class of applicants or refugee status applicants who have stimulated this legislative measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still some doubt as to whether this automatically precludes those who come from areas where there are coercive population control measures. The inclusion of that particular group of people is likely to become a source of comfort for those who believe that the coercive population control measures have some merit. I, for one, do not. I believe that, in the end when people come to look at this stage of our refugee program, the government will be seen for what it is. It is cynically using this issue to help it to take cheap support from what is, in many instances, a legitimate community concern about the adhockery of our refugee program. At the same time, it is being thoroughly hypocritical on human rights abuses which affect a large number of people, particularly women, within the People's Republic of China. </PARA>

This is a matter that goes to the heart of what this parliament, on both sides, is trying to do in our country in the 1990s.

To do this effectively, we must always act in a manner consistent with our declared principles, and we must enshrine these principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put this bill into perspective. We are called upon to deal with people fleeing from brutal and vicious policies enforced by a brutal, communist dictatorship. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, we seem to think that communism has disappeared. It has not in Asia. In the 1950s and 1960s, Australia was happy to take in tens of thousands of refugees fleeing communism. Indeed, the mere act of fleeing a communist tyranny made a person a refugee. What has changed? Only the race of those fleeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition owes the nation an explanation as to why it no longer welcomes people fleeing communism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has had his problems in this field and he can use this debate to help clarify this matter. A non-racial approach is now the law of the land in Australia in these matters. This includes immigration. Unfortunately, the relentless flow of amendment bills from the immigration department over the last 18 months shows a department under siege. The impression in the wider community is of a group of people out of their depth and unable to adjust psychologically to the vast, unstoppable changes that are occurring in Asia, eastern Europe, the Caucasus and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is not another planet. The serious problems on planet Earth are also Australia's serious problems. Many people in Australia are very disturbed at a piece of legislation which has been characterised as unbased of any value system&mdash;human rights or legal principles. Rather, the legislation proceeds by constructing a pseudo problem to fit a bureaucratically desired solution: that is, the unsubstantiated fears of vast numbers of Chinese fleeing the one child policy seeking refuge in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of migration shows that, no matter what happens, the overwhelming majority of people everywhere never contemplate leaving their place of birth. It is a peculiar arrogance of a certain type of Australian to delude himself or herself that, given the opportunity, the whole world would come to Australia. Did this happen when Australia provided the #10 fares for people from the British Isles to come to Australia? How many came&mdash;10 million or 20 million? The people numbered in the thousands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that migration is a very traumatic decision and only a small number of people can ever muster the psychological strength to break from their homeland of centuries past. Let us not exaggerate the joys of living in Macquarie Fields or Broadmeadows, looking different and not speaking the local language. I have had private correspondence with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) on this matter and I deem it so important that I have decided to read the minister's reply to me into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and for the public record. The letter is dated 21 February and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Ms Easson</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter received on 1 February 1994 in which you expressed your concerns in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill implements initiatives I announced on 30 December 1994 to enhance the integrity and effectiveness of the refugee determination system. This is necessary because of a decision by the Federal Court which expanded the meaning of the refugee law term "particular social group" to such an extent as to deprive the Convention of meaningful application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill merely confines the scope of our refugee laws to that which was envisaged at the time Australia ratified of the 1951 United Nations Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, specifically in respect of the Convention ground of particular social group. It is the Government's view that this interpretation accords with the intentions of the drafting conferences on the Convention and the Protocol, of which Australia played an important part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's refugee policy has been developed to put into practice our obligations as a signatory of the Convention and Protocol. Under the Convention a person is a refugee if they have a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion and are outside their country of nationality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Court judgment found that a person may be recognised as a member of a particular social group simply because he or she is a person to whom the fertility control policy of a foreign government applies, or who objects to such a policy. The Government considers that the judgment dilutes the meaning of the Convention ground of a particular social group to such a degree that the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's refugee determination system would be threatened if it were allowed to stand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To regard a large proportion of the population of China, or any country, as a particular social group and therefore as potential refugees simply on the basis of their government's fertility control policy is inconsistent with the intention of the Convention to provide protection to persons with a well founded fear of persecution for one of the Convention grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a pre-existing particular social group, or on any of the other Convention grounds, who has a well founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person from a particular village or workplace who because of membership of a pre-existing particular social group or one of the other Convention grounds is subjected to the application of a fertility control policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation was developed in close consultation with the Attorney General's Department. I can assure you that the measures in it are consistent with our international obligations particularly; those under the refugee convention. The Acting Solicitor General has since, in response to comments by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, confirmed this. In addition the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was consulted both in Australia and at their Geneva headquarters regarding the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has acted to ensure that an inappropriate interpretation of part of the Convention by the courts is corrected. By diluting the meaning of particular social group under the Convention the Court's decision has the potential to undermine public confidence and the ability of our determination system to do the job it was set up to do&mdash;to afford protection to genuine refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is noteworthy that it is the view of the UNHCR that the People's Republic of China's (PRC) family planning policy of one child per Chinese national family is an attempt to control the burgeoning population pressures facing the PRC. The position of that Office is that the law embodying this practice is of general application and does not target any particular groups and as such is not inherently persecutive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chinese authorities have stated that the one child policy is non-coercive and that it is enforced by means of financial sanctions, education and propaganda. If, however, particular cases emerge involving the use of coercive measures such as forced abortions or sterilisations, the Australian Government, in line with the view of the UNHCR, would regard these measures as serious violations of human rights capable of amounting to persecution for the purposes of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You also ask the hypothetical and improbable question of what the Government's response would be if a country, on a family planning basis, ruled that its citizens were not to have any children, and then presumably one of its citizens sought asylum in Australia. Our response would be based on our protection obligations under the Refugee Convention and other Human Rights Conventions. Each case would be considered against the criteria of whatever Convention such a case might invoke.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me also make it clear that the legislation does not prevent anyone from applying for refugee status. Indeed, if, after full consideration by my Department and the independent Refugee Review Tribunal, a claimant is found not to be a refugee according to the Convention but the claimant's particular circumstances are such that they have strong humanitarian or human rights reasons for not wanting to return to their country of origin, I have a non-compellable power to substitute a more favourable decision where it is in the public interest to do so. (Section 417 of the Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope this letter has reassured you in respect of the issues you raised in your letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NICK BOLKUS</PARA>
<PARA>I raise four points on this matter. The 1951 United Nations convention was made in the light of the catastrophe of World War II. A `particular social group' is not a fixed and permanent designation like race or religion. As time passes and tyrannies arise, the wickedness of some people is such that they can devise actions and policies that bring into existence a particular social group. It would have been better if the convention had mentioned the Nazi eugenics program. This interference with human reproduction is the parent of the Chinese one child policy. Because of this weakness in the convention there is no need for us to take advantage simply because the victims are Asians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the letter says that the government has acted to ensure that an inappropriate interpretation of part of the convention by the courts is corrected. Excuse me, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I thought that we were governed by laws, not by men. Since when do courts have to give governments what they want? Are we in this House now going to start on a process of correcting the courts week by week? Can the minister point to a constitutional basis for such a process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third point in the letter informs us that the UNHCR is of the view that, because the one child policy is of general application, it is therefore not inherently persecutive. Obviously one needs to be an international bureaucrat to utter this kind of twaddle. Are we to believe that if you hit 100 per cent of people that is okay, but if you hit only 10 per cent you are brutal and persecutive. China is a tyranny. The Communist Party is brutally tyrannising the whole country in a wide variety of ways. It has been doing this since 1949 and it shows no sign of stopping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point is extremely important. The minister says that the legislation does not prevent anyone from applying for refugee status&mdash;full stop; no ifs or buts. Indeed, the minister goes further and mentions his powers under section 417 of the act. I would ask the minister to clarify this by stating whether an applicant who applied to the minister under section 417 and was refused such an application can proceed to the Federal Court for a determination. I am anxious, not so much for the sophistication and benevolence of the minister&mdash;I know him; he is a good and decent person, doing a difficult job&mdash;but that the department's front line people behave in a manner consistent with Australian values as understood by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a liberal democracy. We are not east Germany in the South Seas. The general tendency in Australia is increasingly to say yes unless the case for no is really very strong. This yes-saying attitude fits in with our desire for freedom and inclusiveness. Australians are increasingly tolerant and, indeed, appreciative of difference. The department should be, more and more, moving in the direction of giving the applicant the benefit of the doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finely balanced arguments should always tip in favour of the applicant. This suggestion is consistent with an inclusive and tolerant approach. These are established Australian values. I am not advocating anything radical. Indeed, the `guard at the Brandenburg Gate' approach of the department is not consistent with Australian values in regard to the refugees that I have met in my electorate of Lowe. It is becoming increasingly clear that our immigration policies are starting to creak under the featherweight strain so far put on them. This is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to Hong Kong on many occasions and things look fine. Experts and officials have told me that the arrival of the communist authorities in July 1997 will still mean business as usual. I believe this to be the case; I certainly hope it is. But what happens if I am wrong? What if 10 per cent of Hong Kong flees&mdash;that is, 600,000 people? What happens if half of them come south, to Australia? The Philippines and Indonesia will certainly give them every assistance to get here. I do not believe that this will happen but governments are paid to prepare for the worst. What happens if my optimistic view is wrong? What is our policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is 50 years since the immigration department was founded and in those 50 years Australia has successfully absorbed over five million people. Central to that absorption has been the excellent and often brilliant work not only of the department but also of ministers, both Labor and Liberal. Not one group has failed to thrive. Not one decision to broaden our approach, to promote inclusion and tolerance, has backfired. We are the most successful multicultural nation in the world. Why? Because we have actively promoted inclusion, tolerance and appreciation, and suppressed hatred and viciousness masquerading as free speech. We have opened our society and economy to all newcomers and we have reaped the benefits. We need to continue these active and excellent policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any group which lands on this shore can contribute to our good fortune and our welfare. Through ABC television we are advertising our social excellence into Asia. We must expect that a certain number will believe our expensive and extensive propaganda, especially as it is true and demonstrably so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To satisfy both houses of the parliament, the minister will have to ensure that his department works well in relation to any applicant who is subjected to the barbarous one child policy. I have been personally assured by the minister that couples from a particular area where the one child policy is enforced&mdash;for example, forced abortion, forced sterilisation and infanticide&mdash;can still form a particular social group. As a supporter of the department and its good work, I would think that it is in the department's interest to produce and publish guidelines to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way to avoid any catastrophe over this issue is to stick closely to our shared Australian views and to see to it that the front-line bureaucrats in the department also operate within the framework of our shared Australian values. Mr Speaker, with misgivings and some considerable worry, I cautiously commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

The fishing boat radioed in English for a specific Indonesian army colonel stationed at Irian Jaya to rescue them. This was done. What did Coastwatch do? It did nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gillespie kidnapping and the subsequent unprecedented number of illegal entries into Australia demonstrate that Australia is perceived as a soft target in the region, and by Indonesia. In particular I might add that Australia is also regarded as a soft target for kidnappers, drug smugglers and illegal immigrants; as a soft target for criminal syndicates; as a soft target for illegal flora and fauna smugglers; and as a soft target for the transfer of human, animal and grain diseases which could wreak havoc if unchecked&mdash;which is another problem arising from illegal entries. Our national sovereignty, our right to protect our borders in defence of our national interest, is simply not being taken seriously by this federal Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the former Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Evans, summed up this appalling situation when he described our coastal surveillance as `20 per cent effective', `almost entirely useless' and `of cosmetic value'. In 1994 Air Vice Marshal Evans repeated his criticism. On this latter occasion he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The north of Australia is wide open for anyone to fly into at any time, day or night, without Defence, Customs, Immigration, police or anyone knowing.</PARA>
<PARA>In his study of Australia's national surveillance requirements written in 1993, Major G.E. Osborne wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the threat and with 25 years of study and debate a unified national approach to surveillance has not been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an appalling situation which cannot be ignored. It must be addressed. Air Vice Marshal Evans and Major Osborne are correct: our coastal surveillance and northern defences are a joke. But it is not a joke for those citizens living and working in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particularly disturbing penetration of our surveillance systems occurred on 22 November 1994. Thirteen boat people landed in Darwin illegally. Their landfall was made only a few kilometres from HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coonawarra</EMPHASIS> fleet base and Larrakeyah army barracks which house the headquarters of the ADF's northern command. Two of the Vietnamese reportedly flagged a newspaper delivery van and caught a ride to the nearest post office where they rang the police to inform them of their presence. Their actions surely make a mockery of our surveillance systems. Where, again, was Coastwatch?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has admitted in this parliament that no intelligence was available to indicate that the vessel was in fact en route to Australia. The Minister for Defence has also admitted that at the time of the boat's arrival a significant number of surveillance assets were preoccupied with operations against a large number of illegal Indonesian fishing vessels and another illegal vessel entering our waters. It has to be pointed out quite directly that Darwin at that time was undefended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence claims that six organisations provide intelligence relating to this particular illegal entry. Where were they? These problems must be faced. Illegal entrants are a threat to our national interest. Illegal entrants are presenting Australia with customs, immigration, quarantine, environmental and health problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our northern shores have become a haven for drug runners. In July last year heroin to the value of $250 million was found in a boat in Darwin&mdash;by accident. The report of the international narcotics control board issued in 1992 stated in relation to Australia that Australian `coastal waters . . . are vulnerable to maritime drug trafficking and it is difficult for law enforcement agencies to cover large and isolated areas'. Put simply, the illegal entries break our laws. The illegal entries are also a burden on the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative and legal costs are disturbing. The Coastwatch service costs $27 million a year. The government spent $65.6 million merely on detaining and determining the status of boat people in the last financial year. Given the additional costs of legal action, it is very likely that illegal entries into Australia are costing this country between $80 million and $100 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question must be asked: why do the illegal refugees choose Australia? The federal Labor government has sent confusing signals over time. It preaches a policy of compassion and later, when the consequences and costs of this policy are revealed, it reaches then&mdash;too late&mdash;for the administrative axe. The wrenching scenes involving illegal refugees we have witnessed on television are due to the failure of successive Labor governments to follow a coherent policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Minister, did you personally conspire with other members of the New South Wales ALP Right to stop the release of logging coupes in New South Wales until after the state election with the pretence that the New South Wales government had not provided sufficient information&mdash;a pretence now well and truly debunked by many people on your own side? As this ploy has now been discredited by the member for Eden-Monaro, amongst others, will you confirm that the federal government has now totally abandoned the national forest policy statement in favour of pandering to the green vote, no matter how many blue-collar workers are thrown on the unemployment scrap heap?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member does himself no credit using words like `conspiracy' in the context of woodchips&mdash;no credit at all. The government, the cabinet, this week dealt with the proposal of the New South Wales government to release a number of coupes in New South Wales, and to do so without the necessary assurances that were available from all other states that the values in those coupes were properly preserved and represented in the rest of the reserve system. It was New South Wales and New South Wales alone that dragged the chain. It was only New South Wales that tried to sell us a pig in a poke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth remembering where Minister Souris, who had the carriage of this matter, was coming from. After the government's initial decision on woodchips, he is on the record in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying that logging in the New South Wales coupes would not be stopped in any of the 509 areas because that would damage the industry. This is the quote:</PARA>

<PARA>So that is where the New South Wales government was coming from, and it is the New South Wales government and the New South Wales government's problem alone that it did not meet the test, did not meet the criteria.

That was the view of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that was the view of the Minister for Resources and that was the view of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories&mdash;they had not met the criteria, the test that our government had set down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news for forestry in New South Wales and for anyone interested in conservation and a balanced approach to logging comes in this document, `Labor's forestry policy', released today by Bob Carr. Let me advise the House what is involved in his approach:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The systematic management of a transfer of logging from high conservation old growth and wilderness to plantation and regrowth forests in accordance with the following principles: the undertaking of a rapid evaluation of existing regrowth forests to determine their suitability as replacement resources for high conservation value old growth and wilderness forests; urgently rescheduling state forest logging programs; initiating an interim assessment process to be completed within nine months; and the conduct in cooperation with the federal government of a comprehensive environmental regional assessment using the terms and definitions contained in the national forest policy statement, along with regional assessment, to be carried out by regional assessment committees, with complete regional assessments to be used to establish a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system as defined in the national forest policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a responsible approach. That is the sort of approach that a Carr Labor government would bring to New South Wales. It is in total contrast with the approach of John Fahey and George Souris, who would log at any cost and who would have those sitting opposite working with them to that end. Those sitting opposite would see every one of those 509 coupes exploited, and damn the environmental consequences. Mr Speaker, we will not have a bar of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something that particularly pleased me today was the balanced approach that Bob Carr took in his announcement and the fact that he was joined in that announcement by none other than the CFMEU forestry division New South Wales secretary, Gavin Hillier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question, Mr Speaker. Today is a very important day for the women of the country to celebrate past achievements and to set priorities for the future. In that context, the government is committed to working with the women of this nation to improve their opportunities in both employment and training outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been substantial gains to date. Some 43 per cent of the work force now are women. Since the government came to power back in 1983, the growth in female jobs has been 48 per cent compared to overall jobs growth of 30 per cent. Since 1993, when this government was returned two years ago, the growth in women's jobs has been 7.2 per cent compared with the overall increase of 3.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the gains, gender equity remains a priority for this government and we have a mechanism in place called the Women's Employment, Education and Training Advisory Group to give direction to the government and support in those areas considered important to the women of the country. I met with this group last week and we have identified further priorities for them. We have identified circumstances in which, by identifying the barriers to getting into work and training opportunities, we can use the programs in Working Nation to overcome those barriers. We want to have Working Nation respond to the needs of women in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, this group had significant input into the government's Working Nation statement. It was their input, for example, that contributed to the development of our ability to treat women as independent for the purposes of access to labour market programs. The parenting allowance and the partnering allowance are both new initiatives that give women a real choice in this economy for the first time to decide whether they want to enter the work force, whether they want to enter training, or whether they want to spend time at home raising their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen, as a result of that advice, the development of employment advisers and contact officers within the CES network specifically to respond to and develop initiatives important to women. We have earmarked some 200,000 labour market program places for the next financial year that will go to women. We have also made the commitment to expanding the number of work related child-care places to 354,000 by the end of the decade, and we have made significant progress in that direction already. We have also developed job clubs specific to the needs of women. Women so far under Working Nation initiatives have been well represented in the outcomes. Significantly, their success rate&mdash;their successful outcomes through labour market programs&mdash;is higher than that for men and what is coming through is that they are more motivated in understanding the importance of training and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the increase in the number of entry level training places. We have seen the higher proportion of women going into higher education places; they now represent 53 per cent of the total.</PARA>

We have also expanded the new enterprise incentive scheme specifically to target women and enable them to start up their own businesses. These are significant achievements to date.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It stems from a combination of what the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to admit to in the conversation he says he has had over the last little while with Mr Packer, and his intentions. But it also has one other twist to it which I have occasion to know. The Leader of the Opposition likes a little gap or two in his history. The Leader of the Opposition was pleased to suggest in his conversation with Mr Packer&mdash;as he tells us&mdash;that he has always been of the view, privately and publicly, that the 1987 rules on cross-media ownership were, as far as he was concerned, to be opposed. That was his private and public view; therefore nothing else needed to be explained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, there was something else that needed to be explained. What needed to be explained was the exact opposite position that he took when he was in opposition in 1991 when the Tourang bid was in there for Fairfax, and the exact opposite position that was taken by the opposition at the time&mdash;as I happen to have occasion to know. I happened to be the minister with responsibility for the broadcasting acts at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It came to the point, in order to clarify the cross-media rules in the context of the Tourang bid, where we were obliged to tighten those rules&mdash;or at least the reporting mechanisms associated with them. What was the opposition's position when we put those bills into parliament? The opposition said, `You are not tough enough. The propositions that you have put forward are not tough enough. We will support you for a period of time in the lower house, but if we discover that the provisions that you are putting in place are not tough enough by the time it gets to the Senate, we will do something about it. In case you don't happen to be absolutely clear why we are doing this, we all signed up for this petition.' The petition was to oppose the sale of the Fairfax group to any individual or consortium that would result in a greater concentration of media ownership. That was signed by the opposition at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was only one issue involved in that bid as far as media concentration was concerned, and that was the cross-media issue relating to the fact that one of the partners in the Tourang bid had media interests in the electronic media that would have put him in the same town with electronic media interests and newspaper interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was only one bid. There is no code in that; that is absolutely direct. If you do not think that the people in Channel 9 may not have noted your opinion at that stage of the game on the Tourang bid and where Channel 9 happened to be, you have got another think coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So as far as you are concerned, you did have something to explain&mdash;and you were good enough to explain it in your last conversation: `Ignore anything I or my colleagues may have done back there in 1991 when the Tourang bid was on the road; ignore any of that. I am back to position No. 1. Ignore position No. 2. I am back to position No. 1. In case you do not think I am back to position No. 1, I will talk about the TPC as the only body that ought to be running these things.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has offered to acquire houses in the area most seriously affected by aircraft noise&mdash;that is, in the over-40 ANEF contour.

There are some 113 dwellings in that contour. Last year all the owners were contacted and offered voluntary acquisition. I am pleased to report to the parliament that 85 owners have so far indicated their interest in selling, and agreement has already been reached on the terms of sale with 24 of those owners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to a comprehensive approach to the school insulation program with high technical standards. It will represent best international practice and will be of a higher standard than would have been provided by the $24 million program originally estimated by the FAC consultants.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following representations from the New South Wales Department of School Education and the Catholic Education Office in Sydney, my department has agreed to stage the work over a longer period than originally planned.

As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, it is the government's policy that, following the opening of the parallel runway at Kingsford Smith, the east-west runway will be used only when cross-winds of 25 knots prevent parallel operations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported on Monday this week, the Attorney-General's Department has advised that, before any government could implement a policy of using three runways for jet operations, a whole new EIS would be needed. As the Leader of the Opposition of course knows, the original EIS was predicated on no use of the east-west runway except in exceptional weather conditions. It was predicated totally on the use of parallel runways. Using the experience of the last EIS, that process would take two years and could cost as much as $9 million. That two-year delay and that cost is really only the tip of the iceberg. Using the CAA's own figures, the reopening of the east-west runway would see a net additional 58,000 people moderately and seriously affected by aircraft noise.</PARA>

I advise the House that, based on the current EIS, the net number of houses needing insulation under the Leader of the Opposition's policy would be an additional 3,710. The number of schools would be an additional 11. The number of child-care facilities would be an additional 12. The number of churches would be an additional 25. The number of hospitals, nursing homes and other health facilities would be an additional 10. All of these would be on the opposition leader's hit list of schools and public institutions. For the information of the House, I table the list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is putting noise back over Rockdale primary school, or Bexley infants school, or the Bexley Private Hospital or St Michael's school or St Stephen's Anglican Church&mdash;all of these are on the list. The list goes on and on. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who back on the Mike Carlton program in 1989 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I grew up under the flight paths in the St George area on the east-west path. I know something about the politics of that area, and I've always regarded the issue of noise as being grossly exaggerated.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a limited number of people severely affected by noise. The great bulk are only mildly affected and in the event bought their houses knowing full well that they were under the flight paths.</PARA>
<PARA>End of quote; end of your whole legitimacy in this argument. It may be that the opposition leader's unsympathetic view of noise applies only to those on the east-west path. But, if he decided that the people who he thinks deserve noise also deserve insulation, the added cost of providing that insulation would be $164 million. That is an additional $164 million impost on the aviation industry in this country by way of an airline tax. If you could think of a benchmark policy for bad policy, the opposition leader has certainly established it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this is nothing more than a cynical attempt to take noise off his own electorate, to take noise off Lane Cove and Hunters Hill. In doing so, he is advocating a policy that would compromise safety and capacity, increase noise for an additional 58,000 people, require a new EIS and, most importantly, require noise insulation for an additional 3,700 houses and 58 public buildings at an additional cost of $164 million. If that is not bad policy, if that is not utterly cynical policy from so-called honest John, I do not know what is.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. The Commonwealth Grants Commission found that in 1993-94 Victorian per capita funding on government education was $511 which, for the first time this decade, was below New South Wales per capita funding, which was $512. However, on a per student basis, New South Wales is still last. Let me firstly comment on Victoria. The Victorian figure includes $180 million the Kennett government spent on redundancy payments to 8,200 teachers whom it sacked. In addition, the Victorian government has closed 271 schools and cut $400 million from the education budget. I ask the House: is it any wonder Victorian parents are concerned about the adequacy of school education in that state?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must also wonder how the Kennett government can justify spending $20 million on political advertising, $30 million on new offices for the Premier and Treasurer, and $1.5 million in the courts to try to keep Northlands secondary college closed, but will not properly resource Victorian schools. Five years ago, Victoria was ranked second in per student spending on education and was above the Australian average. In 1993-94, Victoria was last and well below the Australian average of $538. While seeking efficiencies is desirable in any public enterprise, cuts of this sort cannot be achieved without a significant impact on the quality of education in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, five years ago the per student expenditure was the second lowest in the country. Today, New South Wales has fallen to last place and it now spends nearly $250 less than the Australian average per student. This is a record of which the people of New South Wales have not been told. Indeed, listening to the current Premier of New South Wales, you might be led to believe that that state is leading the charge in education. In fact, most of what the New South Wales state government is telling its public is totally misleading. It says, for example, that in this financial year $136 million is allocated for TAFE capital works. It forgets to mention that $75 million of that $136 million is, in fact, Commonwealth money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that nothing gets done in New South Wales unless the Commonwealth initiates it. For example, the year 12 retention rate in New South Wales is now the lowest of all mainland states. The Premier of that state can afford to promise to put a $65 million glasshouse over the Cahill Expressway, but he will not commit himself to the youth of New South Wales by providing adequately for their education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last five weeks, there has been a veritable cavalcade progressing around the state. The New South Wales Premier and the New South Wales education minister have been moving around that state, opening schools and TAFE colleges, yet 72 per cent of the capital cost of those schools and TAFE colleges is being met by the Commonwealth. They drive down roads lined with signs saying `New South Wales government&mdash;building better roads'. They pull up outside schools where there are signs saying `New South Wales government&mdash;building better schools'. I took my family to the zoo over Christmas&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member, I have noticed reports of corruption in Cambodia. They are widespread and I fear that they are of considerable substance. I am encouraged, however, by the fact that Cambodian leaders themselves are beginning to recognise publicly just how serious a matter this is for Cambodia. Indeed, at a conference in Phnom Penh on 2 and 3 March, Cambodian ministers were admirably frank in acknowledging the extent of corrupt practices and the need for change in them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Prime Minister, Hun Sen, called for an anti-corruption law; a strong, independent investigatory mechanism; better pay for public servants; and a program which would educate the public not to offer bribes to officials. He also endorsed a strong watchdog role for the media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been given a fresh start by the Paris peace accords, Cambodia has now reached a crossroads where it can choose the path of a jungle economy where the power of the bribe is greater than the power of law, or sound economic management, transparency and the supremacy of the legal process. Australia is, of course, a major donor of development assistance to Cambodia and all the donors are saying to the Cambodian government that now is the time to nip the trend of corruption in the bud&mdash;difficult as it is&mdash;and not later, when it is too late.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a threat, as some have suggested, but we are saying that donors' trust and confidence in the Cambodian system, to which they are committing large amounts of taxpayers' money, need to be strengthened. The need for strong measures and leadership in stamping out corruption is just one aspect of entrenching good governance in Cambodia. Strengthening the apparatus for the protection of Cambodia's human rights is another. In that regard, Australia has played an important role not least through the efforts of Justice Michael Kirby, who is the UN rapporteur on human rights in Cambodia&mdash;and a very fine Australian&mdash;and also through the work of John Holloway, our former ambassador to Phnom Penh, who now provides advice and guidance to the Cambodian Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through such interactions, and in many other fora, we have set out very forcefully to senior cabinet ministers&mdash;including to both prime ministers and most recently to Mr Keat Chhon, the Minister for Finance and the Economy, when he visited Australia recently&mdash;our concerns about good governance, economic management, human rights and corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be raising these same issues shortly at the third meeting of the International Committee for the Reconstruction of Cambodia, at which I will be leading the Australian delegation. This is a meeting which brings together all the aid donors, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Cambodian government. Our message at that meeting will be that we understand the difficulties and that progress does not happen overnight, but the honeymoon is over and the Cambodian government will need to demonstrate to donors evidence of its commitment to the accountable democratic principles to which it agreed in the Paris peace accords. Those are legitimate expectations on the part of donors and it is important that the Cambodian government understand that clearly.</PARA>

As recorded on page 1688 of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the Attorney-General made it clear that the Commonwealth had been withholding disclosure of some documents in a court case in South Australia in contravention of the requirements of the court system and possibly in breach of the affidavit its officers would have signed with regard to this matter. In the light of the implied involvement of this parliament in such litigation between the Commonwealth and some Australian citizens, will you implement the appropriate inquiries to establish whether the Commonwealth has acted with due propriety and fairness in dealing with its citizens in this court action and/or whether it has breached the procedures of the court?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing you can take for read in this place is that when members of the New South Wales Right get their hands on the levers of power, good government based on rational decision making, integrity, a vision for the future, what is right for the community, and common interest go out the window. In place of good government, you get opportunism, government by deals, and government in the interests of the mates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about the mates these days is that the mates are no longer the traditional Australian Labor Party constituency. They are certainly not the blue-collar workers. they are certainly not those honest working men and women of the country that for years the Labor Party claimed it has been keen to represent. It is all about deals and government in the interests of the mates&mdash;and haven't the mates had fun with forestry policy in the last few months. Haven't they had fun with forestry policy in recent months!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not much evidence of good government here. There is no real evidence of a commitment to good policy or even to process. It is all about deals. Of course, we had two ministers who made a frightful mess of this: the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, in the other place. Having made the great mess in this area, it became necessary for the mates to determine that they would have to find somebody better to clean it up&mdash;Beddall and Faulkner not really having the approval or the stamp of the New South Wales Right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the New South Wales Right figures to get involved in this was none other than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Paul Keating came in and, realising that he had a glorious mess, thought that he had better make sure that he had somebody to clean it up, so be brought in Bob Collins. But Bob ain't from the New South Wales Right either. So when Bob started to look as though he was going to base a policy on commonsense, rational debate and a little bit of intellectual rigour, the Prime Minister decided that he'd better move him aside in the interests of the New South Wales election result. So, before Paul left, he allowed brothers Laurie and Michael to take over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He decided that, in the interests of looking after Bob Carr, he'd better bring the New South Wales mates into the scene so that they could bring some influence to bear. One of the things I would like to know is how much those two gentlemen might know about forestry. Do you think they'd know a lot about forestry? What about sustainable development&mdash;sustainable production in the timber industry?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Costello" NAMEID="CT4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of them might; the other one obviously missed out. But one of them might know quite a bit about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Play School</EMPHASIS>. What about regional policy? What about regional development and commitment to jobs? Do they have any area of expertise in that line? How about conservation values? Have you noticed these two ministers having a great understanding of conservation values and commitment to them? I'll tell you what they do know a lot about though, particularly the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), and that's deals. They know a lot about deals&mdash;they've been doing deals for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the forestry area we have a long history of deals&mdash;deals done with the extreme greens in particular&mdash;culminating in a frenetic level of activity in recent months. The pity of it is that only one member of the Labor Party has reflected any clear understanding of the result, and that is Jim Snow, the member for Eden-Monaro. He got it right the other day. He said, `They're all confused.' That is the truth. You are dead right, Jim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But people outside the government can see what is happening. They can see quite clearly what is happening. If you put it under a broad heading you would call it a giant exercise in cheap, political opportunism. That is what it is. When it comes to forestry practices in this country, there are certain things that you can take for granted. Or let me put it this way: there are certain things you can forget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing you can forget is a rational forest policy because the real agenda is to keep the greens on side. It is to promise them anything, say anything, do anything&mdash;just pander to them to the point where they will make some commitments on votes and preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would have thought that by now those opposite would have got the message that the greens are not interested in a rational forest policy. They want to shut down the industry and they will keep extending the goal posts. I would have thought that they would have woken up to that, but they have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can also forget any suggestion of rational economic argument in this area. Kerry Packer tried to remind the government the other day that we have a problem in this country with the trade deficit. We hear the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) referring to this very often. With one of the major contributors to that problem, the area of forest products&mdash;paper and wood&mdash;we have a $1.7 billion deficit. But I do not notice any great willingness on the part of Australians to give up using paper and wood products. I certainly do not notice it from the people opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that one of the first areas in which you would move to correct this problem, one of the most obvious areas, is to put in place a rational policy for the sustainable production of timber in this country, including plantations. But the shenanigans of those opposite in recent times are frightening off investment, as they are jobs in forestry, because, apart from anything else, they are undermining confidence amongst those who might go down the road of plantation production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can also forget the government crying about regional development and jobs. It is lip-service. All the rhetoric goes up in smoke when some interest group decides that there is an industry out there in regional Australia which, for whatever reason, it would like to close down. The regions should take note. The government's forestry policy has cost, is costing and will continue to cost a lot of jobs amongst the very people that it claims it represents out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here is the rub. The other thing you can forget is any commitment to responsible environmentalism. The government has completely devalued the process of evaluation of areas that ought to be logged&mdash;not woodchipped; this is about logging, the areas that should be and the areas that should not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laurie Oakes had an interesting perspective on this. He highlighted the fact that Minister Faulkner had been unwise to hand out a whole lot of taxpayers' money to green groups to go out and come up with a list of areas that ought not be logged. I can see that the minister at the table, Minister Beddall, agrees with us on this if on nothing else&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that correct, Minister? But that is what Senator Faulkner did. So we had these groups being funded, such as the one in northern New South Wales. The list of people on that consultancy committee came back. There were about 10 names, and at the bottom it had `Natalie and others', from places like Nimbin, Coffs Harbour and Dorrigo. Who were these people? Undoubtedly, they were the self-confessed, self-termed forest ferals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, can you imagine what would have happened if you had done the smart thing and funded the timber industry to go out and tell us which areas ought to be logged? What would have happened then? That is what you should have done because that would have highlighted the stupidity of the process. You failed, Minister, to point out to your Prime Minister and the cabinet what was under way and would lead to this mess, to this debacle. But you did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did you end up with? In the words of Laurie Oakes, `a list so utterly shonky that the government cannot defend it'. Then he went on to say, in reference to Senator Faulkner, `Here is a minister who came into the portfolio determined to end up looking like Senator Richardson.' Presumably, that is his hero. But he came out looking more like Ros Kelly. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is Laurie Oakes's version. The other thing to forget is resource security. Back in December the Prime Minister said, `We have to sort this mess out.' He suddenly found out that we had a mess. Never mind that his government had been responsible for the mess; that he allowed a department to be so politicised under his minister for the environment that this outcome was inevitable. Never mind that. He rode onto the stage and said, `We have to fix this industry up. We have to get some security for investment. We have to look after the boys' jobs out there.' This is unbelievable stuff because the Prime Minister presided over the very process by which that investment and those jobs had been so decimated; so put at risk; so stripped away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, you can forget, Mr Acting Speaker, since you are part of the team, any suggestion that cabinet might deal with the coupes before it with any semblance of intellectual rigour or integrity. No, the cabinet will not do that because, apart from anything else, there is a state election in the air and the fix-it boys have decided that they had better intervene in the interests of Bob Carr. Not that Bob Carr knew anything about it! He was obviously taken by great surprise when he heard what cabinet had done&mdash;his `mates' from the Right. So we pushed Bob Collins out of the way. That is what we did. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. Anyway, with Paul Keating's blessing he was pushed out of the way and we brought in the New South Wales Right. Minister Brereton and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) have intervened to prevent any New South Wales coupes from being released in the last list. This was done on demonstrably spurious grounds. Let us be absolutely plain about this. The idea that this was all done because the information from New South Wales was not adequate, was not fully documented, and all the rest of it, is an absolute furphy&mdash;a nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, it totally ignores the arrangements that Senator Collins and the New South Wales minister, George Souris, had sorted out over nine telephone calls. A very amicable arrangement and a relationship between the two of them developed during this process. They worked out a set of arrangements under which coupes were starting to be cleared. But suddenly, no. The New South Wales Right said, `We can't have this. Bob is looking a bit too rational. The process is working itself out. We had better make sure that we fix it up.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the lie to the answer given by the Minister for Resources yesterday and the Minister for Transport this afternoon. I will nominate just three&mdash;I could go on with others, but I do not have time&mdash;of the 22 coupes that are on that list that cabinet said could not be cleared because there was not enough information. Minister, three of them, as you well know, are in the south-east forest region and they are specifically covered by what is known as the Eden native forest management area agreement. That agreement was signed by Ministers Lee and Souris a couple of years ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Minister Lee. Do you know him? He knows a lot about forestry, too. That was effectively a regional assessment of the very sort advocated by the national forest policy statement to which you say you are now committed, and which you now say is the way forward. It recognises that there is adequate representation of the forest values in the area set aside. In other words, in plain man's language, there is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for withholding those three coupes. I am sure that the same could apply to any number of others.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us be very plain: the only deal that was ever contemplated here was the deal that the New South Wales government wanted&mdash;to be treated specially or different from any other state. As I go through this process, I will explain to you exactly how that was the case. There is no political opportunism about this matter at all. Before I go to some of the nonsense you have put forward today, it is important to understand exactly what the process really is, not what you want to make out it is. As everyone knows, the government has been considering the quick release of some coupes that have been identified for interim protection, pending further assessment, where they have lost their conservation values and where the industry is running out of timber and the values in those coupes are well represented in the existing reserve system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 9 February, 57 coupes were removed from the original list of 509. These coupes satisfied the criteria that had been set for that review&mdash;that is, operations in them were under licences issued in 1993 for 1994 and were reissued for 1995, they were currently being logged in accordance with licence conditions and they were not on the Register of the National Estate. The remaining coupes of the 509 listed are going through a more detailed verification process that involves assessment by Commonwealth and state officials of the conservation values; consultation with industry, union and environment groups; consideration by cabinet of the information gathered; and, finally, determination by me as the responsible minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I announced the result of the next phase. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, the total process is to be finalised by the end of March. I announced yesterday that a further 53 coupes would be released from the interim protection list announced by the government on 27 January this year. As I said before, this was after detailed assessment by my department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. It also involved consultation with state officials, industry, conservation and community groups, unions and advice from the Australian Heritage Commission. Cabinet considered the information that had been assembled. It was my responsibility to make the final decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the coupes released, 36, are being released at the states' request, on the basis that they have now lost the conservation values for which they were originally included on the list. There are coupes being released in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Ten coupes have also been released at the request of the states to allow sawmill operations in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania to continue to the end of the assessment period&mdash;that is, the end of March. I agreed to the release of these 10 coupes primarily on employment grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt conservation values are present; however, I am satisfied on all the evidence presented to me that this will not close off any option in achieving the government's objective of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system for Australia's native forests. The relevant values are well represented in the existing reserves and other protected areas in the states concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also six coupes on the original list that New South Wales has now advised will not be the subject of export woodchip operations. Therefore, these have been released. In addition, approval has been given to a road upgrading operation in one coupe in Western Australia: Peak WPKO. This is because road upgrading can take place only before the start of the wet winter conditions. It should not be seen as an indication that the Commonwealth would subsequently approve export woodchipping of this or adjacent coupes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You want to make out that the government's woodchip policy will be determined by the Canberra by-election and the New South Wales state election. That is sheer fabrication. As I said yesterday, unlike other states, the New South Wales government did not provide the necessary information and assurances about the level of representation in reserves or of the value in the coupes it nominated for release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of coupes so far follows the process laid down by the Prime Minister on 2 February this year. The release of these coupes strikes the necessary balance between the development of a sustainable forest industry and the protection of our valued forest reserves in reserve systems. Coupes that did not meet the criteria were not released in several states&mdash;not only New South Wales but also Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. Further coupes were not released in New South Wales because the state government had not been forthcoming on the values contained in forest compartments. It has also not been forthcoming on values in the existing reserve systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of giving us this information, New South Wales has asked the Commonwealth to endorse its forestry assessment and regulatory processes and to release all nominated coupes on that basis alone. New South Wales wanted to be treated differently. It did not want to go through the processes all the other states were going through. The Commonwealth is not satisfied that the New South Wales processes are adequate to protect forest areas and will not consider accrediting these processes until further assessments are completed. On a preliminary analysis of New South Wales data on existing reserves, I am told that several forest types are significantly underrepresented in that reserve system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear just once more. New South Wales has been treated in the same way as all the other states. Do you hear that? It has been treated the same as all the other states. Of course, Commonwealth officials will continue to consult with relevant agencies and other stakeholders in New South Wales about the values of the coupes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to point out that the earlier release of coupes included 35 from New South Wales. Yesterday's announcement brings this to 43 out of the 110 coupes released. In a press release yesterday, the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), also tried to make out that we were walking away from the south-east forest agreement. He made that charge again in this MPI. We are not, and I cannot say it any more plainly than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commitments under the agreement are subject to the Commonwealth and New South Wales meeting statutory obligations. It will be as a last resort only that coupes are withheld from logging at the end of March. This will be only if the values are not adequately represented in the existing reserve system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said I was wrong about New South Wales being treated the same as other states. Let us go through it and see. In New South Wales, processes are in place to address each of the values identified by Senator Faulkner through the endangered fauna act, the timber industry acts, the New South Wales EIS processes and the wilderness act. Each of these processes is partially managed or determined by an agency external to State Forests of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In south-eastern New South Wales, the conservation values of forests have been further addressed by the 1993 south-east forest agreement covering the Eden forest management agreement. I never said we may not be able to use some of these processes to assist in the assessment of values. The major deficiency is that the degree of representation of different forest types within the reserve system cannot be accurately determined at this point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you listen, I am explaining it to you now. It is because the various land management agencies in New South Wales do not have compatible methods of classifying flora or communities&mdash;that is, the New South Wales departments themselves&mdash;and because substantial areas of reserved crown land in New South Wales have had little ecological classification work done on them, particularly in some of the national parks. This could not be overcome before the decision was made this week. It will also make harder the assessment of the remainder before the end of the eight-week period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other point I would like to make concerns the EIS determinations the New South Wales department of planning has specified. The major problem with them is that their requirements are not based on the status of communities across all land tenures, and they reflect a generally lower percentage of reservation than in other states. It is difficult to be precise about the percentage of reservation because of the lack of knowledge about the New South Wales reserve system&mdash;that is, your counterparts in New South Wales have fallen behind and failed to represent their constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been no regional assessments of national estate values in New South Wales, as there have been in Western Australia and Victoria. The joint scientific committee report during the development of the south-east forests agreement process examined some but not all national estate values in the south-east area. Your claim that the results of the state election will determine the outcome of the eight-week assessment process&mdash;or for that matter our woodchip policy&mdash;is just plain wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have always said that the assessment process was an eight-week process. We also said that we would release some coupes if we could. We have; we have released 110 out of 509. Unlike those opposite, we have the bigger picture in mind. We do not lose sight of that, and we do not get bogged down in point scoring. It is too easy for you to get sidetracked. The work we have in place will prepare the policy framework for a sustainable forest industry&mdash;an industry with greater emphasis on regrowth, plantation operations and downstream processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discussions are under way with a number of states on scoping agreements that set out the timetable and process for developing the regional forest agreements. This will provide the umbrella for sustainable forest operations within a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. We have to ask ourselves: where is the opposition policy? It does not have one. It has been silent on the bigger issues. All it can do is mirror policies that this government has implemented. Our actions are taken against the background that the states are committed to the review of reserve standards. They have undertaken to protect other coupes on the interim protection list as long as sufficient coupes are made available to meet short-term employment needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are acting to make these things happen&mdash;you can't. You have no policy content at all. It was we who introduced the national forest policy. We brokered the deal, and it is a deal that we are very proud of. We are getting into place, as the Prime Minister said, a policy that covers areas where the states have primary responsibility. It is not an area of policy failure or political opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 30 January, the truth came out from John Fahey, your hero in New South Wales. He said that he would ignore the Prime Minister's latest woodchip bans. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Government will defy the Prime Minister over his new woodchip bans, vowing to continue logging in all forests identified by the Federal Government as having high conservation values.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the attitude of John Fahey. That means that he knows and acknowledges that he, not the Commonwealth, has the primary responsibility for land management. You cannot run a national forest policy statement on just an export control act. You need the cooperation of the states. We have had the cooperation of most states but not of New South Wales. We are about providing the basis for long-term work that resolves the contentious forest issues. The NFPS was signed by all mainland states in late 1992. Unfortunately, Tasmania is yet to sign, and we are still hopeful that will take place shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of the NFPS is the proposal to determine forest use on the basis of comprehensive regional assessments that will cover all relevant environmental, heritage, economic and social values. The conservation and industry uses will be settled within the RFAs between the Commonwealth and the states. Comprehensive regional assessments and regional forest agreements can be started only by an invitation from the states. They have to invite the Commonwealth to join them. So far only one state&mdash;that is, the Labor state of Queensland&mdash;is in the game. Victoria had shown interest in the RFA for its central highlands but broke off negotiations before Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have met informally with my state colleagues about this matter. In April I will be bringing together the ministerial council that covers forestry issues to keep the momentum going. At the first meeting of ministers for forestry and fisheries, the state that was not represented was of course New South Wales. The Prime Minister's announcement has considerably increased the awareness of the importance of the states to start CRA and RFA processes. Export licences for woodchips from native forests will be reduced annually to zero in the year 2000, except for forest areas covered by regional forest agreements or where substantial progress towards such agreements has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states are responsible for day-to-day land management issues. We must never lose track of the fact that in forest policy the Commonwealth is trying to balance completely opposing views by using the Export Control Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members would be aware, 85,000 people are employed in this industry. In 1993-94, the balance of trade deficit in forest products was $1.8 billion&mdash;about 10 per cent of our current account deficit. Exports were $859 million. About half was woodchips and a quarter was paper and cardboard products. Imports were $2,639 million. About half was paper and a quarter was sawn wood. We lose sight of the fact that the states control the resource. The Commonwealth controls only the licensing of export woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have about 41 million hectares of native forest around Australia and around 30 million hectares are in public ownership. Only about a quarter of that amount is available for multiple use, including wood production. I am sure those opposite would agree with me that we should now be doing much more to value add. Only then will we create and keep jobs in this industry. Why are you not out there talking about a sustainable industry and about how we as a country have to achieve that difficult balancing act with the retention of all our values?

This document covers every aspect of the forest operations, especially in the south-east area. It is volume one of the main report and there are two supporting documents to it. Let me draw the attention of the House to the detail in that document. The index lists the EIS approach&mdash;how it might approach the whole study&mdash;environmental planning processes and environmental objectives. Under the heading of `timber harvesting', the document refers to levels of supply, areas to be logged and order of working, description of harvesting operations, types of harvesting operations, and timber harvesting monitoring and feedback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details in this document are very clearly set out. The index refers to road construction. It also refers to other forest management activities, such as catchment management, weed management and control, feral animal management and control, European heritage site management, visual resource management, tourism and recreation management, education management&mdash;that could be good for the government&mdash;and research management. It goes on to talk about alternative coupe harvesting and the code of logging practice. It also refers to the biophysical environment, natural fires, soils, terrestrial flora, terrestrial fauna, timber production values, Aboriginal archaeology and sites of cultural significance, conservation values, old-growth forests, the social and  economic environment&mdash;the minister at the table suggested that the government has not taken this into consideration&mdash;and environmental protection measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document clearly sets out how the New South Wales government has assessed these areas. A fantastic amount of effort has been put into this document and my understanding is that it has reached world best practice in the evaluation of the south-east forests. Compare that with the document the government is using to support its arguments. Its document is a study prepared for the federal Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories by the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales, the West Australian Conservation Council, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and Environment Victoria. I happen to know that these particular groups have been funded by the government. The government's document is 14 pages long and the government relied on it for its recommendations of how it should operate. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Areas of high conservation value threatened by logging and woodchipping within the next three years were identified and deliberated in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia. The study undertaken in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia represents the most thorough examination yet completed of areas proposed for logging and woodchipping.</PARA>
<PARA>The most thorough examination. How would this document compare with the document of the New South Wales state government? Yet during this debate the minister at the table said that the evaluation by the New South Wales government was inadequate. The government's document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary purpose of the project is to identify old growth forests and wilderness areas likely to be of high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>It prejudged the position even before it even started this argument. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The specific methods that have been used varied from region to region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surprise, surprise. Recommendations of the federal government's study were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Native forest woodchip logging should immediately cease so that the remaining old growth forest in the south east region of NSW will not be destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. A comprehensive, representative and adequate reserve system should be immediately set in place to give protection to the South East forests of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The 121 compartments listed in the report should be placed under an immediate interim moratorium as a first step towards achieving these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>It is saying, `Here are the recommendations. We will have a moratorium and then we will have yet another government inquiry.' The final recommendation was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Further field research and assessment of scheduled logging compartments should occur before logging commences to identify other areas of high conservation value old growth forest.</PARA>
<PARA>We are saying there has been enough evaluation of these projects. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) is the only member on the government side who understands the details of the issue. As the shadow minister said, the member for Eden-Monaro was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program, and he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I've seen copious information from New South Wales but I can understand Cabinet Ministers that have never been involved in forestry not being able to assimilate it.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess they could not understand it. They could not read all this information. They were happy to read this 14-page document which prejudged the position before they even started. The member for Eden-Monaro, who knows about forestry matters, knows the timber workers and understands their families, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It's really a cop-out. A further postponement, and actually a bit of disappointment because, while we're prevaricating here in Parliament House people are going broke, and families are breaking up. People that have been under stress are under even more stress. So, it's absolutely a cop-out as far as I can see. Even though I appreciate that some Ministers were a bit confused by the information before them.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously they have been a bit confused in view of the cabinet meetings they have been having. Furthermore, the member had a good ally on his side of politics, Mr Michael O'Connor, who is the assistant secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. Mr O'Connor had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, I think the Australian public, along with the union, will see this smacks of political wheeling and dealing. Quite clearly, everyone knows that on March 25th there's a State election. It's tight. Labor is desperate to win it, and have New South Wales not have any logging coupes released before 25th March. Quite clearly it smacks of them attempting to support their mate Bob Carr. Unfortunately it probably will have the reverse effect.</PARA>
<PARA>There is one of their friends&mdash;one of their supporters&mdash;supporting our view 100 per cent; that is, that this whole argument is poll driven and supported by very questionable assessment techniques. In the 15 minutes available to him, the minister tried to demonstrate that the Commonwealth had a better understanding of forest issues than all those state instrumentalities throughout Australia. Those state instrumentalities have spent a lifetime in the forest, evaluating good timber, bad timber and the trees that are to be cut, yet the Commonwealth thinks it has a better understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that, in the parliament on 2 February our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) put these two points of view quite clearly. He said:</PARA>

It is a battle against a great reservoir of Australian public opinion in favour of our natural habitat and those important, historic, pristine stands of trees.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his view. He was taking the poll and disregarding the arguments of the loggers and those people who need some woodchips to make their operations profitable and effective. But at the very same question time, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last election reveals that none of you knew the code to the poll; none of you understood the code&mdash;let me tell you what the code is. It has four letters&mdash;J-O-B-S.</PARA>
<PARA>What does Prime Minister Keating say to the member for Eden-Monaro about the jobs in the south-east forest area? What is he saying about that as coupe after coupe is closed up and as the New South Wales outcome is evaluated in terms of the polling that takes place there? Finally, to add insult to injury, in the electorate of the member for Eden-Monaro we see a press release with the heading `Coastline Timbers Pty Ltd'. It was released yesterday. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twelve months of planning by State Forests and ourselves to provide both summer and winter logging and gaining subsequent approval from National Parks and Wildlife Service has been nullified by the inclusion of all our approved compartments in the 509 compartments withdrawn from logging in January by the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had Compartments 225 and 232 been released as promised 10 days ago this closure would not have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a forest mill in the member's electorate whose activities were previously agreed to by the state government in New South Wales close down because of a government decision at the federal level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was speaking just prior to question time I was highlighting the lack of coherence in the immigration policy the government has been following, particularly in respect of the refugee problems in northern Australia. In that context I have to say that Prime Minister Hawke's policy was tear driven and this government's policy has been crisis driven. Prime Minister Hawke was undoubtedly moved by the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. However, allowing the unprecedented number&mdash;29,000&mdash;of Chinese students and their dependants to stay in Australia sent the worst possible signal to the region; that is, one of weakness. It reinforced the regional perception that Australia's immigration laws were subject to the whims of the Prime Minister of the day and that we were a soft target for illegal immigrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government has no coherent policy. It is reactive and fragmented. It is crisis driven. Under Labor there is no such thing as an immigration policy; there is only the management of crises as they occur from time to time. As a noted foreign affairs commentator and South-East Asian expert, Milton Osborne, recently pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by 2000, Australia could be facing arrivals of boat people on a scale never experienced before.</PARA>
<PARA>That would be a national crisis which invites these questions: how will the government then cope with the 5,000 illegal immigrants expected to reach Australia in 1995, this year? Further, how will it cope with the expected exodus from Hong Kong following the British departure in 1997? Moreover, how will it cope with the possible unprecedented waves of refugees from the social turmoil in China after the death of Deng, assuming that has not already occurred?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence of the integrity of our coastline should not be the responsibility of the Australian Customs Service and Coastwatch. Coastwatch is inadequate. Coastwatch is inefficient and it is not cost effective. It is not a dedicated and disciplined coastal surveillance service and it is reliant on the support of the armed services to fulfil its role. It has no strategic guidance whatsoever. It is a mosaic of competing client agencies: the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Department of Defence&mdash;each with different and often competing surveillance and intelligence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our coastal surveillance is, therefore, now a shattered mosaic. Since the inception of Coastwatch in 1988 it has been the centre of no less than six government inquiries and reviews and, above all, protracted and costly legal disputes between the parties involved in the tendering process. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KD4">Mr ALDRED</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has a lot to do with it, as you will see shortly. Coastwatch has been involved in tendering disputes which cost the Commonwealth&mdash;the Australian taxpayers&mdash;millions of dollars. Currently, Coastwatch is the subject of yet another protracted legal dispute. The four previous operators of Coastwatch claim that tender evaluation procedures were not followed; that some bidders were excluded on Public Service evaluation of their management backgrounds; that critical decisions were withheld from tenderers during the tendering process; that government representatives who were responsible for the process audit also served on the tender evaluation committee; that an extra aircraft was added by the successful tenderer, and that there was a late substitution of radar to affect the tendering process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, at least one Australian customs officer who was directly involved in the assessment process was also involved in a tendering dispute in 1990. Apart from the mushroom cloud of scandals and inefficiency hovering over Coastwatch, the central point&mdash;to come to the concern raised by the parliamentary secretary&mdash;is that Coastwatch is not a deterrent to the problem that this legislation purports to deal with. It has no powers of arrest or interdiction. On rare occasions, Coastwatch has alluded to its lack of capability. In 1992, Coastwatch publicly stated that if suspect illegal entrant vessels:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . were to become a more regular occurrence and target wider areas of northern Australia, it is unlikely Coastwatch could provide the required level of protection for north western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The Coastwatch management, in this rare and refreshing example of candour, should have added that it could not provide the required level of protection for the coastline of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its annual report for 1993-94, Coastwatch claimed to have intercepted six suspect illegal vessels and coordinated the apprehension of 33 foreign fishing vessels in the Australian fishing zone. However, in November 1994 a Coastwatch spokesman stated that, in a single 10-day period, over 580 Indonesian fishing vessels had been operating within the Australian fishing zone. One must ask two questions in respect of this. Are the Indonesian authorities engaged in testing or probing our national will? Is the Indonesian government testing our capability to react to its flagrant breach of Australian and international laws concerning the sovereignty of our coastline and coastal waters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the most effective deterrent&mdash;indeed, the only deterrent&mdash;to illegal entries, which this legislation is purporting to deal with, into our exclusive economic zone and our fishing zone is the Australian Defence Force, the ADF. Only the ADF has the national wide area surveillance assets, including the vital communications, control, command and intelligence systems to deter, monitor and interdict illegal entries into our coastal waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, only the national surveillance assets of the ADF can protect Australia's coastline&mdash;the longest ice-free coastline in the world&mdash;from illegal intrusion. Only the ADF can protect our 200-mile exclusive economic zone and our 200-nautical-mile fishing zone. Only the ADF can conduct surveillance to cover the coastline of the Northern Territory, which is over 5,000 kilometres long and the favoured point of entry for illegal entrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the ADF should be expanded and extra funds allocated to establish a real coast watch. The ADF already plays an important support role in assisting Coastwatch. This role should be extended. The ADF should have the total responsibility for coastal surveillance. Protecting our maritime interests is too important a task to be left to private contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the ADF's dedicated system of coastal surveillance would send a clear signal to our region that we are seriously committed to the integrity of our coastal waters and the nation. Australia is a sovereign nation. We have the legal and moral right to protect our borders and coastal waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not demonstrate that we will defend our coastal waters from illegal intruders, we will not be respected in the region. We will continue to engage in reactive, crisis driven measures. We will continue to place a great financial burden on the Australian taxpayers. We will continue to be at the mercy of illegal entrants who exploit our vulnerability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should Australia do? We should draw a line in the sand now. We should place on notice those groups and countries which hold us in such contempt&mdash;the drug dealers, the kidnappers of children and the military clique who control Indonesia. Now is the time. If we do not act now, future generations will demand to know why we failed to protect the integrity of our national borders and our national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve the objective of deterrence, we need a dedicated surveillance service. All major Western countries have a dedicated surveillance service or involve the armed forces in coastal surveillance. Only Australia has the cumbersome Coastwatch organisation which is at the mercy of client organisations. Only Australia allows the tender process to determine our coastal surveillance and defence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, the Gillespie case and the unprecedented number of illegal Indonesian fishing vessels detected in Australian waters last year underscore the point that it is time the government&mdash;and Senator Evans in particular&mdash;stopped fawning and grovelling before the Indonesian government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. For the last 10 minutes I have waited for the relevance of the honourable member for Deakin in talking about Coastwatch. I would ask him, and ask you to ask him, to refer back to the bill. The bill is very clear and very precise. It has nothing to do with Coastwatch. He said it was going to be relevant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem we have with this legislation is that, again, it is another aspect of a very fragmented approach to deal with the question of illegal entries. Only by revamping the situation of northern Australian surveillance and defence can we overcome that problem so that we send the right signal to the region, and to Indonesia in particular, in respect of illegal entries into Australian waters.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, empty words are to be found everywhere. In supporting the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, which I do so very strongly, I believe this bill is as mild as the government could possibly make it. It is a bill which has been made necessary by the actions of Justice Sackville. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> When speaking in this chamber, one always feels constrained to speak in euphemistic terms, but it is quite clear that Justice Sackville is one of that class of new-class posers who believes they can move the law in any direction they choose like pawns on a board. Power without responsibility is the hallmark of many of those today who think that they can make these judgments without regard to the long-term costs or the responsibility of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now required to legislate to put it beyond doubt that the Chinese one child policy does not constitute grounds for recognition of refugee status. In my life in this parliament I have probably done more refugee work than has any other member. In my view, the issue of refugee status is going to become an ever increasing conflict for us. I believe the time will come when this legislation will be seen merely as a stopgap. People have mentioned here today that they have had feelings of deja vu about this legislation. It reminds me somewhat of shifting the deckchairs on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>. For the mass movement of people throughout the world, things are set to grow to such proportions that no country will be able to afford to distinguish between genuine refugees and economic refugees. That is a very sad thing. However, it is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always impressed by the grasp and understanding of this subject by the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson). While my views go a lot further and are a lot stronger than the views of the member for Reid, he is certainly a man who takes this subject very seriously and has given it a lot of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard a lot of talk in here today about human rights. I am a great believer in human rights. I believe that human rights should be given paramount respect in this country. We ought to make sure that Australia is in good order before we start haranguing other nations. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) has spoken of his disquiet about the human rights situation in China. He has said it is a situation he would not tolerate. That is just as well; he has no influence on that country and, in my view, nor should he. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been going to China since the very early 1980s. I think I have had five trips. I have seen enormous changes in that country and, without a doubt, enormous improvements. How glib it is to come in here and talk of the problems that face China, a country with over a billion and a half people and a rapidly expanding population. There is a piece of old Red Indian wisdom that the member for Moore might take to heart: never judge a nation or a people until you have walked in their shoes for a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chinese have been working very hard to try to come to grips with their problems. I predict that in the years to come we will be contrasting the responsible attitude taken by China with the much more irresponsible stance taken by India. India has a big disadvantage: it is a truly multicultural society with masses of different and conflicting peoples. That makes it very hard to legislate, very hard to get a consensus. China has enormous homogeneity&mdash;over 98 per cent of the people of China are Han&mdash;which makes it much easier to pass laws which are generally accepted by the mass of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in China I raised the issue of the one child policy. The people were prepared to talk quite freely about it. I particularly discussed the matter of divorce among the Chinese, which is not a particularly common occurrence in China. They assured me that they would have no trouble with the one child law, as it refers to one child per couple. One gentleman in particular said that he intended to have another child and that his wife would have another child with whom she chose to marry next. We were also told that in China the laws are not enforced against the very small ethnic minorities. Indeed, with a shrug of the shoulders, one Chinese official told me that it was impossible to do so. My view is that there should be one law in a nation. I do not believe that multiculturalism is a reason for having diversity of laws or the application of those laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in China, given its enormous problems of population, should be treated with much more tolerance by the people in this place. Ironically, they are often the people who seek to inflict the same sort of mess over time in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> These quorums tend to lead to a disjointed speech. In speaking on a bill such as this, when there is not a lot more that can be said, I have decided to adopt the policy of previous speakers by speaking in slow, moderated tones so that it takes longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carrying Justice Sackville's logic to its ultimate conclusion, the circumstances of people who are subjected to nose piercing in Papua New Guinea or to female circumcision&mdash;in fact, any disfigurement: lip pulling, neck stretching or perhaps even male circumcision&mdash;could be used to trigger the terms on which refugee status is granted. We could get to the stage, with people like Sackville, where demands made by foreign armies that their soldiers have their hair cut are grounds for refugee status. We should realise that it is not a concern of ours. To accept that would inevitably leave Australia open to a flood of refugees. It is because of that we find ourselves in the position of having to bring in this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somebody even criticised the gift to China from Australia of ultrasound equipment. Ultrasound equipment is used for many purposes. It is absolutely absurd to suggest it should not be supplied, sold or given because it may be used to determine illegal pregnancies. In fact, without mass screening, for which the Chinese certainly do not have time, it simply would not be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) mentioned coastal surveillance. Coastal surveillance is relevant to an element of this debate, and that is to make the point that it really has no relevance. No matter what you do with coastal surveillance, it will not stop the flood of people if they decide to come because coastal surveillance has no real capacity for interdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time will come when we will need a much greater capacity for interdiction of people who are spotted by coastal surveillance. The rate is somewhat higher than the 20 per cent claimed but it will always be a hit-or-miss situation. A far greater deterrent is the quick processing of these people and returning them to where they came from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, the delay in processing has almost always been caused by the actions of lawyers who act for them. These people have sought and gained delay after delay. For this reason it is necessary to legislate so that they do not get continuous bites at the cherry. Quite clearly, if they are being provided with sanctuary in a third country, they are no longer a threat. While they may not like that third country, while the grass may not be as green there&mdash;and I accept that it is not&mdash;as it is in Australia, it is clearly not our responsibility under any convention on refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in Australia today a grave mistake. The truth is that both major political parties in Australia today are adopting a policy of unfettered, world free trade. This can only lead to declining living standards in this country and an enormous pressure from mass movements of people elsewhere. As free trade and competition strikes Asian agriculture, many people will be simply severed from their jobs and will drift to the already overcrowded cities. I believe that the pressure of the mass movement of people will be irresistible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), I do have a number of concerns about the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994, which I wish to outline to the House this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this legislation, which relates to refugee status, must be put in the context of the tests which have to be satisfied for a person to qualify as a refugee for this country. Basically, there are two strands to the test: firstly, that the person must face a real chance of persecution; and, secondly, that the persecution feared must be based on one of a number of grounds which include race, religion, nationality, political opinion and&mdash;importantly in the context of this bill&mdash;membership of a particular social group. In satisfying the requirements of the convention, it is important that both tests be met. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the member for Paterson (Mr Horne) found my remarks so interesting that he thought more of his colleagues should be here to hear them. I come now to a point that should be made while there are more of them here, and that is that this is basically a political stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a bill before the Senate which the government could well have made amendments to in the terms of this bill, but the only reason it did not do so was that it knows that it cannot call a double dissolution should a bill be initiated in the Senate rather than in the House of Representatives. It well knows that, and that is the reason we have this bill introduced here at this stage.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying, this is a stunt, because it was possible for the government, if it wished to make amendments to this legislation based on the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which looked into it, to make them in the Senate and have the bill brought down to this House. But it pulled the bill out of the Senate and introduced another bill down here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did that precisely for this reason: should this legislation be objected to in such a way that the government could call a double dissolution, it would not be possible for the government to call a double dissolution on the basis of a bill that is initiated in the Senate. The government well knows that. That is what this stunt is about. The government is desperate. It is so on the nose with the Australian people that it is desperate for a double dissolution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason this bill is unnecessary at this stage is, as those opposite well know, that there is an appeal pending before the Federal Court. This is a ridiculous use of the time of the parliament, to be bringing on a piece of legislation to overturn the decision of one judge of the Federal Court when this particular issue is on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court. This is a ridiculous use of parliamentary time and those opposite know that is the case. If they will allow me, I will turn to some of the substantive issues of this bill. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they will not, that is fine; that is their business. The fact is, if they look at all the evidence that was provided to the Senate committee in relation to the previous bill&mdash;which they whipped out in order to bring this one in&mdash;evidence from a range of community groups, from Sir Ronald Wilson to the Catholic bishops, various federations of community and ethnic affairs groups, and right through a whole series of other people in the community, they will see that they all said the principles upon which this bill was drafted are flawed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take the House to the evidence which was provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees about the basis for this bill. I refer to the letter from Mr Fontaine, the regional representative of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, to the department dated 23 January 1995. Honourable members will see that the basis upon which the government is legislating in this particular bill is one which is absolutely and categorically rejected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. If I get a chance, I will quote from some of the passages of the letter. For example, Mr Fontaine says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me reiterate the concern that my office has with regard to the legislative approach to resolving the issue of the one child per family policy as a ground for refugee status or for claiming membership in a particular social group within the meaning of article 1(A)(2) of the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees. It was explained by the department that legislation was the most expeditious way of proceeding with this matter as it would circumvent the effects of a lengthy judicial process and would act as a deterrent to potential future unauthorised arrivals. The UNHCR does, of course, recognise the practical importance of speed in this matter. As you know, however, expeditiousness, as in fair and expeditious procedure, is the enemy of fairness and vice versa. Furthermore, there are very good reasons why there is no precedent for legislating such matters which are best left to the courts to adjudicate. We are concerned that such legislation would create a most unfortunate precedent, not only for Australia but also for the world at large.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we are, rushing in whilst there is an appeal on foot to the full court of the Federal Court, and legislating against a decision which is consistent with decisions that have been made elsewhere. If you were not confident that that was not the case, you would not be rushing with this piece of legislation in the first place. Let me go on with what Mr Fontaine said. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would be guilty of dereliction of duty if we did not invite the government to consider again the legal, political, moral, international and humanitarian costs of the approach being taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then he takes one of the principal points in what was the previous bill and which is repeated in this bill in proposed section 36(3)(b) which refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fertility control policy of a government is to be disregarded in determining whether a person is a member of a particular social group.</PARA>
<PARA>The representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a legislative measure would certainly prevent the use of the one child policy as the sole ground for defining a particular social group, which is what the department wishes to accomplish.</PARA>
<PARA>He is agreeing with what the department wishes to accomplish in this paragraph. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This in itself is not a problem except for the fact that it is wholly unnecessary as the Sackville decision is in no way inconsistent with such a stand. Indeed, to be a member of a particular social group is not equivalent to having a well founded fear of persecution, but more about this later. What is much worse, however, is that the above mentioned formulation would render it impossible for anyone to obtain refugee status in Australia, no matter how harsh or abusive the punishment feared or suffered in the implementation of the one child policy unless they can claim another convention ground for refugee status, which I understand is not the intention of the department. It is our fear that this unfortunate use  of legislation, if carried through, may then proceed to be viewed internationally as an acceptable precedent. Such an example might provoke a set back in the interpretation and application of the 1951 convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well be that my remarks are brief, as it would appear that tactics have priority over ideas this afternoon. I am pleased to support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) because I am not prepared to allow anyone but this parliament to decide the policy in relation to the admittance of refugees into Australia. I also note that the shadow minister, Senator Short, is also pleased to support this bill. On 7 March he said in a press release:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition strongly supports the principle underlying the Government's Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, namely that China's One Child Policy should not in itself be grounds for the grant of refugee status in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>We need this bill so that there can be a definite position on who should be admitted as a refugee into this country. It is not a matter of race. As the bill says in proposed section 36(4):</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fertility control policies of the Government of the People's Republic of China are an example of the policies referred to in subsection (3).</PARA>
<PARA>They are an example and, therefore, demonstrate that the bill is not predicated on race. For the sake of pursuing this argument, I would like to read from the explanatory memorandum to this bill the reason it was presented. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs challenged a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("RRT") that a married couple satisfied the definition of "refugee"&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.D.M. Dobie)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! If the members on my right have the compulsion to talk, could they do so quietly. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2H4">Mr STEELE HALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wondered whether, for the prospect of completing my speech, it might be best to let them go on as they were. I was quoting from the explanatory memorandum, and I continue:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs challenged a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal . . . that a married couple satisfied the definition of "refugee" within the meaning of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees . . . on the basis that each of the couple had a "well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of . . . membership of a particular social group".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RRT found that, as a result of the policies of the Government of the People's Republic of China . . . "those who having only one child do not accept the limitations placed on them or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised" are a recognisable social group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Court held it was open for the RRT to make these findings . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum goes on to say that the bill provides that the fertility control policies of the government of a foreign country are to be disregarded in deciding whether a class of persons is a particular social group for the purposes of applying the refugees convention when considering the application for a protection visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply have to take precautions against not only those refugee applicants who lay claim to this situation but also public opinion among certain people within our own community. I refer to a letter from the Chairperson of the Right to Life Australia&mdash;which I am sure all members received&mdash;that contained, to my mind, the most ridiculous assertion in relation to the policy that that organisation believes we should adopt. For the record, I will read the parts of that letter which are germane to this argument. The chairperson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to express our concern at the Federal government's decision to preclude by legislation those Chinese who claim refugee status on the basis of the one-child policy.</PARA>
<PARA>She referred to Dr Lynette Dumble's assertion that the bill was `an inhuman policy for population control'. She further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the bill is passed, Australia will stand condemned for turning away from our vast empty land, people who are likely to be subject to an enormous abuse of human rights in their country of origin.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that letter is advocating that any Chinese woman who believes she is facing a restriction on the quantity of her family should be able to migrate to Australia as a refugee and complete that family here. That is the essence of that letter, and of course it is absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can be proud in Australia of our record in taking refugees into this nation. The official figures for 1993-94 show that the United States, with an official migration intake of 700,000 people, took in 125,000 refugees and that Australia, with an official migration intake of 63,000 people, took in 13,000 refugees&mdash;a quite favourable proportion in relation to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Until now Australia, as an island continent, has not been subject to any great pressure in relation to illegal immigrants and contested applications for refugee status. That is not the case for countries in Europe such as Germany, which has been subject to enormous pressure, and the United States in relation to its landed neighbour, Mexico. Now, however, the effect of distance is diminishing rapidly as the world enters a multifaceted period of globalisation. Our concern with the future is very real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various assessments of the number of refugees in the world. One of the official assessments by the United Nations is that there are 20 million refugees. An assessment by the OECD is that there are 40 million refugees. However, a research paper which is available generally&mdash;a paper I obtained from the library research service&mdash;indicates that a huge number of people are now outside of their own country. I listened with interest to the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) when she spoke of her lukewarm support of this bill. She tended to dwell in the past in relation to the movement of people. She made a case that migration is a very difficult decision to make for individuals and that therefore we are not likely in this world to be inundated with applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think she misses the point that the fluidity of populations in the world has dramatically increased in the last few years. Figures show that 70 million people in the world are working outside of their own country and that 100 million people are living away from their own country. These figures are dramatically increasing. The movements in and out of Australia are predicted to be 20 million by the year 2000. There will be 20 million people using Australian international airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to our own region. In 1991 there were at least half a million Indonesian workers in Malaysia, the bulk of whom were there illegally. There were 100,000 Malaysians in Singapore and 4,500 in Japan. Thailand both imports workers from and exports labour to Japan and Taiwan. An estimated 150,000 contracted temporary workers entered Korea in 1990. In 1991 an estimated 42,000 overstayed their visas, and there were an estimated 70,000 illegal immigrants in that country. Taiwan in 1991 opened entry to foreign workers in 15 occupations. The Taiwanese government has admitted to about 40,000 overstayers. Japan has admitted to an illegal population of about 300,000. The world is waking up to an enormous movement of population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These mass movements are affecting practically every country in the world in the 1990s. Australia is one of the few remaining official immigrant receiving countries along with the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand. Of the approximately one million persons who migrate legally as permanent residents each year, about 70 per cent are admitted into the United States of America, 20 per cent into Canada and the rest into Australia. Proportionately in terms of population building, Australia's postwar migration program has been the most significant. About 23 per cent of the population of Australia is overseas born compared with about 16 per cent in Canada and nine per cent in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We need to keep public opinion running in Australia in support of our official migrant and refugee policies. We can do that only if our policies are well known and definite. We have to reduce the waste of unwarranted applications for refugee status. The research paper shows that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 the cost to Western governments of processing refugee asylum applications and providing social security to applicants awaiting decisions was estimated at around $US7 billion per year: ten times the annual worldwide expenditure of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and one-seventh of the total annual amount of development aid made available to the Third World from the west.</PARA>
<PARA>This refugee question, apart from the mass movement of people, is economically of immense importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I have said, there are various estimates of the number of refugees. The United Nations has estimated that there were 1.8 million refugees in 1974, 8.4 million in 1980 and 19 million in 1994. The OECD indicates a higher figure now of 40 million. Therefore, we are in a situation of great fluidity with a great deal of expansion in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research paper, in commenting on these matters, draws attention to a second factor. Apart from those who are quite clearly and obviously in a refugee status, it refers to the inevitable growth of a young and increasingly educated population which cannot be absorbed into Asian economies at the level appropriate to their training, skills and aspirations. This growth is expected to greatly increase pressures on traditional immigrant receiving countries, especially Australia, for permanent migration. However, the typical sorts of international population movements in the Asia-Pacific region have changed&mdash;from people seeking permanent homes in the less populated traditional immigrant receiving countries of the United States, Canada and Australia to temporary movements, particularly within the region, in search of work and in response to investment and technology flows. These temporary movements are seen as part of the process of regionalisation and as being accompanied by the transfer of skills and other resources at many levels. They have enormous social, economic and cultural implications for the countries concerned as well as foreign policy implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures and references simply amplify the situation as being extremely fluid and developmental. There is no doubt that since the first boat sailed unnoticed up the creek in Western Australia the pressure on Australia has become a growing and increasing factor&mdash;one which I think Australians generally are aware of. It behoves this parliament to make sure that Australia's sovereignty in this matter is secure and that our official refugee programs are also secure so that they can proceed in an orderly and sensible fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not the slightest possibility of adopting in Australia the crazy policies alluded to in the letter from Right to Life Australia. There is no way that we can become a life raft for an unwarranted and unsubstantiated flow of world refugees. Australia is not that life raft. It is a country with a sensible migration program and an honourable record in receiving and nurturing refugees. It should be allowed to make the rules that will allow it to continue in that responsible fashion. I therefore support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;What a wide ranging debate we have had on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, which is before the House today. A number of questions have been asked and I will certainly endeavour to answer some of them in the limited time I have, especially the ones the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) expressed. Before doing so, I would like to commend the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall). He has been very thoughtful, and the figures and statistics he provided were very thorough. But, most importantly, I commend the member for his appreciation and understanding of the refugee issues facing this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe one of the things we need to do is bring back to relevance what it is all about. As the member for Boothby acknowledged, it is really about the Australian government's commitment to having a well-designed population program that not only meets individuals' needs for voluntary, safe and affordable refugee standards but, more particularly, makes sure some of the decisions made do not disrupt our policies in that regard. We in government certainly agree that the general application of that one child policy is not inherently persecutory. We as a government are certainly opposed to any cohesive measures involved in forced sterilisation or abortion. But it is also a position shared by most other refugee receiving countries, particularly in Europe, where we know that PRC asylum applicants have generally not been successful in gaining refugee status on the basis of the one child policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come back to the honourable member for Berowra. When he first began to speak in the debate here today, he asked why we were introducing this bill in the House. I will tell him and the coalition why we introduced this bill in the House. We introduced this bill in the House because the Senate&mdash;particularly the opposition committee members&mdash;misrepresented and manipulated the meaning of the bill. Through that manipulation, it misrepresented the intentions and effect of this bill. The opposition claimed it has indicated its support for the bill but, obviously, the member for Berowra and Senator Short forgot to tell their colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other place, Senator Ellison, Senator O'Chee and Senator Abetz indicated that they certainly did not support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. They rejected its importance and they certainly misinterpreted its provisions. They said that the legislation seeks to disqualify those who have a well-founded fear of persecution just because they are the unfortunate victims of China's fertility control policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has never had this effect. It has never been the government's intention to do so. This was made clear in the second reading speech in the other place and the explanatory memorandum, and is now incorporated in the bill before the House today. I believe the opposition in the other place was in disarray. Senator Short certainly did not understand the bill and I believe that the honourable member for Berowra did not understand some parts either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In leading for the opposition today, the honourable member for Berowra&mdash;I am glad he is here now&mdash;referred to Senator Short's press release. The honourable member read out one paragraph after the other. I can honestly say that not only is Senator Short's press release a misrepresentation about what the bill was about in the Senate but its explanation is garbage. The opposition spokesman on immigration should recheck his facts before he puts out press releases like the one he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra raised a number of other points. As I said to the honourable member for Boothby when I commended him, one of the reasons we brought this bill before the House was to protect the integrity and effectiveness of our refugee program, particularly on how we run the determination system. It is most important to ensure that all people with a well-founded fear of persecution are able to present their case in a timely manner. The member for Berowra read from Senator Short's press release, even though we knew that press release was inadequate and certainly not correct. I believe what the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 2 March. He made a lot of sense, particularly when he referred to the conventions that have made up a lot of the debate on the bill today. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the nations that came together to draft the refugee convention in the aftermath of World War II had no doubt of the categories of people to whom they wished to give protection as refugees. They did not intend the scope of a "particular social group" to act as a catch-all to cover all harm directed at all persons.</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to put that into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because the honourable member for Berowra was specifically asking us to define a pre-existing group. The first thing he did was ask us to define a pre-existing group. </PARA>

The aim of that intervention would be to allow that person to remain in Australia. The member for Berowra knows this. The government has made its position clear time and again.</PARA></TALK.START>

When I was summing up on another bill before the House on immigration, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) asked why we were backflipping over the bill. We were not backflipping at all. We were putting in a bill to bring forward the decisions of the people of Australia. I said then and I repeat to the honourable member for Moore: these changes are in this bill because we are listening to what the people are saying. These amendments, and this bill in particular, are supposedly being supported because, again, we are listening to what the people have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moore then went on for 10 minutes before he even got close to what the bill was about. But if anyone wants to take the cake it really has to be the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). I was loath to even take a point of order on him. When the member spoke for some 10 or 15 minutes about Coastwatch, it reminded me of someone's grievance debate speech that would have taken 10 minutes, but the member revamped a speech from his bottom drawer and chose to talk about immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how we could have an immigration debate on one child fertility policies&mdash;and the honourable member for Deakin started to talk about Coastwatch. Even I after 15 minutes had to call a point of order. It really is typical. It is typical of the opposition. If you do not understand or appreciate a bill before the House, what you do is revamp another speech, pull it out and use that as the topic and just refer occasionally to the headlines of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is more important than that. The number of people who have made very good speeches and contributed to the debate before the House appreciate also the understanding of the debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) stated that it is a political stunt; that that is why we are reintroducing this bill to the House. It is no political stunt on our part. Time and again we have found that all that the opposition does is backflip if it has any threats whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been introduced so that we can define very clearly where we stand as a government and certainly define very clearly those decisions, to which the honourable member for Berowra referred, that had been made in the court. I would refer the honourable member for Menzies to page 3 of the explanatory memorandum. I pulled it out because I knew it had been issued and I thought it was very clear. Section 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the Court's interpretation is inconsistent with the definition of a refugee under the Refugee Convention in that it effectively extends the concept of a "particular social group" so as to include all persons subject to the fertility control policies of a government.</PARA>
<PARA>Even though the debate we have had has been wide ranging, I think at times we need to come back to the facts before the House. We certainly need to come back to what the bill is about. The honourable member for Berowra has asked why we introduced the bills in the House. Perhaps I should go a little more slowly and do it one letter at a time, one verb at a time, one noun at a time so that he can understand what this bill is all about. That is why in thanking everyone who has made a contribution to the debate I will also say that I commend the bill to the House and I feel sure that it will have the coalition's support in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been trying to resume my comments since 2 March. It is a bit like the people who have a problem giving up smoking: it seems to take an awfully long time. Before going back to my remarks, I want to raise an issue that came to my notice over the weekend: some media publicity about the Indy car race in Brisbane and criticism of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in granting an exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, that is an issue of some concern to me and other members, and indeed people in my electorate. People are aware that in the bill that we are debating at the moment there are specific exemptions for events of international significance, particularly where that event might be withdrawn from Australia if certain agreements for sponsorship were not carried out. I certainly have expressed my concerns to the minister and I have no doubt that she will address this issue in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the whole issue of sponsorship is an interesting one. The tobacco industry seeks to suggest that this is a matter of community good and that there is no evidence that sponsorship has any impact on young children, particularly, deciding to smoke. The Ford Marketing Manager, John Probert, is quoted in a July 1992 publication by the Tobacco Institute entitled `Tobacco advertising and sponsorship: the real issues in the debate'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People get the wrong idea about the sponsorship and try to define it in sales value. It is a corporate image exercise.</PARA>
<PARA>This was also quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> on 3 February 1991. The corporate image exercise, in my view, is exactly what a lot of advertising and sponsorship is about. You would also have to ask the question: why are tobacco companies prepared to sink millions of dollars into sponsorship, in this country some $20 million, if they do not think they are going to get anything out of it? The fact is that transnational companies like Philip Morris have company assets of $70 billion. They are using loose change here, but it is to improve their corporate image. I think that the issue of international events is going to continue to be a problem. But we as a government have made clear commitments to phase out domestic sponsorship by the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw your attention to the sponsorship promotion, for example, of the Winfield Cup, which is the rugby league cup. As I was coming down in the plane on Monday morning I picked up an insert from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> dated Monday, 6 March. It is all about the upcoming Winfield Cup season. Clearly, across the bottom, several column inches high are the words `Winfield Cup&mdash;simply the best' with the rugby league logo and so on, but it is exactly the same logo that we recall from Winfield cigarette advertisements. The back page is a full page blow-up of this logo. I think these sorts of things are very instructive, because when we get down to it this is advertising a logo for a well-known cigarette brand. The reason Winfield became one of the best-known cigarettes in Australia goes back to the days when we did allow television advertising. It would have to be said that the very successful use of Paul Hogan in the Winfield commercials is still, I am sure, in the Australian psyche. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you put together the incredible popularity of rugby league&mdash;the fact that it is telecast, the talk is of the Winfield Cup&mdash;it may well be, as he says, that when Wayne Bennett thinks about the Winfield Cup he does not think about cigarettes; he thinks about a football match. However, for children of course there is an association. They go to the rugby league or watch it on television and then they walk into a shop where cigarettes are on sale and easily available at the eye-line of young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cigarette companies and the Tobacco Institute present material that suggests that you cannot say there is a causal relationship because in certain countries where advertising has been banned consumption has gone up, and in other countries where it has not been banned it has gone down. That is a very simplistic view of advertising. There are many other factors involved. It would certainly be my strong contention that sponsorship is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer once again to an article I referred to in my previous comments. The article, entitled `Peter Jackson&mdash;you're lying', is from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Drug Education Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> of 5 January 1991. In the report, the author Margaret Powell refers to information gained by the US Federal Trade Commission in 1975. I will quote at some length because I believe this article indicates the real agenda of tobacco companies and why they continue to want to get around our legislation, continue to advertise in whatever way they can and sponsor various sporting and cultural events. These things are important to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This article relates very much to the uptake of smoking among children. A report from research agencies to a tobacco company, gained by the US Federal Trade Commission in 1975, is a damning indictment of the intent of cigarette advertisements. That intent is described in the report, which advises how to introduce young starters to a particular brand of cigarette. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the younger smoker the cigarette is not yet an integral part of life, of day-to-day life, in spite of the fact that they try to project the image of a regular run-of-the-mill smoker. For them, a cigarette, and the whole smoking process, is part of the illicit pleasure category . . . In the young smoker's mind a cigarette falls into the same category with wine, beer, shaving, wearing a bra (or purposely not wearing one), declaration of independence and striving for self identity. For the young starter, a cigarette is associated with the introduction to sex life, with courtship, with smoking `pot' and keeping late study hours.</PARA>
<PARA>The agencies make some recommendations about the right approach to children. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus an attempt to reach young smokers, starters, should be based . . . on the following major parameters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Present the cigarette as one of the few initiations into the adult world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Present the cigarette as part of the illicit pleasure category of products and activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In your ads create a situation taken from the day-to-day life of the young smoker but in an elegant manner have this situation touch on the basic symbols of growing-up maturity process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.To the best of your ability, (considering some legal restraints) relate the cigarette to `pot', wine, beer, sex etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Don't communicate health or health-related points. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the hidden agenda of the tobacco companies and is the reason they continue, whether through a High Court challenge, through sponsorship or through other types of product initiatives to make sure their brands are well known by young people. As the Royal College of Physicians in 1978 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by the age of 20 . . . if a person is still a non-smoker . . . he is unlikely to take it up.</PARA>
<PARA>That very vulnerable time is when young people are most likely to take up cigarette smoking, particularly young girls. We have seen this from the figures. We know that becoming addicted to the drug is not simply a physiological addiction to nicotine but it comes at a time of great social and psychological plasticity of young people as they are beginning to learn how to conduct themselves in their work and peer relationships and in handling stress. The intricate behavioural responses involved in smoking become established&mdash;hard wired, if you like, into the brain&mdash;and it takes major changes to deal with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking to a Comcar driver in Brisbane on the weekend. He told me of his own experiences of being completely unconscious of when he was smoking. He told me of a veteran with whom he had been discussing this matter, a veteran who had stopped smoking some 20 years before. Simply as a result of discussing smoking the veteran found himself unconsciously putting his hand in his pocket for a cigarette box. That is a graphic example of the sort of intricate behavioural processes that become hard wired at the time young people are forming their whole way of coping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another story that I would like to add comes from another Comcar driver. It sounds like I have been in a lot of Comcars but it is part of the job. A delegation from Singapore was recently being taken around to various government departments in Canberra. At the end of this tour, one of them said, `They are very good here, the government, the way they provide prostitutes for all the government workers.' He was referring to all the people standing outside government buildings smoking. This is pretty horrific and I am sure it is an unintended consequence of the excellent decision to ban smoking in the workplace. I suggest we will have to look at this because we cannot have our international reputation tarnished by the addicted members of our work force who find themselves having to go outside to up their nicotine levels. However, I would prefer them to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this Bill and look forward to this government maintaining its commitment to removing all the domestic tobacco sponsorship and advertising because we are dealing with a major health issue, the leading cause of drug related deaths in this country. The other thing we have to be aware of is what cigarette companies are doing internationally in Third World countries. We can take a major lead. I do not believe we should allow the tobacco companies, with their massive wealth, to continue to encourage young people in this community to smoke and create major and continuing health costs to this country&mdash;often there is premature death. It looks as if I will run out of time, Mr Deputy Speaker, before I can give you a lovely example from my own training in this area in the coal industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;There has been a very wide ranging discussion, to say the least. I would like to thank all members who have spoken on the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill. They include the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron)&mdash;and we have just heard from the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to say that, obviously, the government does welcome the opposition's support for the bill, but I feel I need to make some final comments in relation to the issues raised by members, especially by the member for Chisholm on behalf of the opposition. The question has been raised about whether or not these amendments were brought forward because the government was guilty of faulty drafting of the original legislation, the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chisholm suggested that it would not have been necessary to bring forward this bill if more care had been taken in that original drafting process. While I have some respect for the honourable member for Chisholm, I have to say that on this point he is mistaken. The aim of the amendment bill is to clarify the operation of the act, matters which could not have been foreseen when the act was brought in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member is also aware that largely the matters the amendment seeks to address, including the issue of freedom of communication, came into contention as a result of recent High Court rulings. We know quite a bit about some of the High Court rulings, especially the case of Theophanous v. Herald and Weekly Times. There is also the Cunliffe case. Obviously, those determinations of the High Court have had some impact and have some bearing on this issue. Consequently, it was important that the legislation be amended to take account of those and other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that was raised by the opposition was the consultation process. Some honourable members saw fit to call into question the extent of the consultation surrounding both the preparation of the initial legislation and this bill. It is incorrect to suggest that the original act was not the subject of extensive consultation and consideration. At the time of drafting, the government consulted widely, receiving extensive advice on all aspects of a tobacco advertising ban. As a result, the implementation of the legislation has been smooth and effective. The few ambiguities which have been identified in the monitoring and evaluation of the act, which are subject to the proposed amendments, are minor in character compared with the enormity of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, many members have talked about how successful the act has been, and how important the policy and the act have been in changing significantly the whole culture of advertising vis-a-vis tobacco smoking in this country. So suggestions that somehow the act was a failure&mdash;the kind of statement we got from the honourable member for Chisholm&mdash;are incorrect. The fact is that changes have had to be made as a result of the learning curve in understanding how the legislation has operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real character of the legislation has been very important in this country. We reject the idea that there was insufficient consultation or that it was not sufficiently thought out. As I have mentioned, the issues that have arisen have been primarily as a result of the High Court determinations. They were not foreseen, but we have moved to try to ensure that this does not in any way prevent the operation of and the essential purpose of this act, which is to ensure that the people of Australia are not subjected to advertising in relation to smoking. That is the fundamental issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course complex questions and unintended consequences have arisen, such as the possibility of a cigarette company being able to advertise for workers, the use of the name of a company, and those sorts of issues that were not intended. But, if any cigarette company thinks that it can overcome the ban on advertising by tricks, it will find that it will be dealt with under this legislation. If necessary, we will put in further legislation to deal with companies if they think that in some way or other they can get around the central meaning of this act. However, we feel that in this legislation we have dealt with the major issues that have arisen to this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the desire of many members of this House to see the demise of smoking. We have the problem that, notwithstanding education and control measures, people still smoke. A lot of members expressed concern about that. This government has done a lot to try to discourage people from smoking, by the banning of advertising and by education campaigns. But we are not about to move to ban tobacco smoking. What we are going to do is to continue in full force our education campaigns and the rigorous application of the advertising rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For three decades Australian society has succeeded in achieving a steady decrease in smoking rates. To ensure this decline continues, the government advocates and has implemented a multifaceted approach to tobacco harm minimisation. It is well known that no measure is effective in causing a change in the smoking habits across our society. This government relies on a range of measures which include education; information on the health effects of tobacco consumption; price, as an obvious phenomenon; and breaking the link, through tobacco advertising bans&mdash;this is very important&mdash;between positive images and smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members have rightly raised the question of why we do not raise tobacco excise. Price is an important deterrent to smoking, especially amongst young people. Consequently, from a health perspective there is considerable merit in seeking to raise the price of tobacco products. However, excise issues are ultimately a matter for the Treasurer (Mr Willis). I assure those members who raised this question that their views will be conveyed to the Treasurer and to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). Any decision that the government makes on this matter will obviously be dependent year by year on budget and other considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again reassure the House of this government's commitment that any drug which robs the Australian community of 52 lives a day, 365 lives a week, 19,000 lives every year, demands the strongest possible action by government&mdash;this government and the state governments. This government is right to be proud of its efforts to date on this matter. Indeed, to the credit of the opposition, the government has received bipartisan support in these efforts, and I hope will continue to do so. I commend this important bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>Both the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994 and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 have already been considered in some detail by this House. They were originally introduced in the Senate in February 1994. After being passed with minor amendments, they were introduced into the House in May last year and were subsequently referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That committee examined the bills in considerable detail and a number of amendments were made as a result. The bills were then returned to the Senate in order for the Senate to agree to those amendments made by the House. The Senate agreed to those amendments on Monday, 27 February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while the bills were waiting to return to the Senate, the United Nations established another tribunal. The bills were originally designed to enable Australia to comply with obligations pursuant to the former Yugoslavia War Crimes Tribunal. However, on 8 November 1994 the United Nations Security Council established a Rwanda tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's obligations in relation to both tribunals are essentially identical. Australia is required to extend identical assistance to the Rwanda tribunal as is already provided for in the bill in relation to the former Yugoslavia tribunal. The amendments were therefore made in the Senate to extend the bill to the Rwanda tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity was also taken in the Senate to make further minor amendments and to correct some deficiencies in the main bill. Those amendments simply consist of minor drafting changes which are, in fact, consequential on amendments made in this House. In accordance with the committee's recommendations, the term `exceptional circumstances' was replaced by `special circumstances' in a number of places in the bill. However, some occurrences of the term were overlooked resulting in inconsistent terminology. These amendments will simply remedy this deficiency. </PARA>

Might I simply acknowledge the welcome fact that, in this instance, a very useful function in relation to legislation before the parliament was found for the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and that its recommendations have been acceded to largely in this place and by the government in the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All too often it is Senate committees that, because of their different composition, are given the opportunity to consider legislation in detail and to make observations, and sometimes, in the situation where negotiations occur, their recommendations are acceded to by the government. To my way of thinking, there needs to be a very positive approach taken to the committee work in the House of Representatives. I think this case demonstrates the very useful role that House of Representatives committees can fulfil. That ought to be commented on positively, and I do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to the issue concerned, the only additional and useful observations I could make are that, while there are many in Rwanda who are in detention charged effectively with war crimes, there has been no proper judicial system under which they can be tried. To release such accused could subject them to very difficult revenge attacks. We have seen a great deal of the unfortunate activity that one might describe as largely lawless that has occurred there with attacks on individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of an international tribunal was seen as an appropriate solution by the United Nations and those who participate in it. Of course, we have had the international obligations that have been created in relation to that. It is unlikely that this amendment will have any practical impact for Australia. While there is the possibility that war criminals from the former Yugoslavia might have made their way to Australia under the immigration criteria that we have, particularly the extensive family reunion provisions that operate, it is quite unlikely that would happen in Rwanda. I do not know that there has been any significant movement of people from Rwanda to Australia. We have had some asylum seekers from other parts of Africa&mdash;Somalia in particular&mdash;but it is unlikely that it would happen in Rwanda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, by applying the procedures in the principal bill to the Rwanda situation, it is a simple means by which we can fulfil here the obligations that we have assumed internationally. It is a gesture of support to that tribunal and, for that reason, the opposition does not oppose the amendments to the legislation. We think there are no good reasons to object to the extension of those procedures; thus, we will not be opposing either the bill or the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been concern by some apparatus licensees, particularly amateur radio operators, that changes proposed as a result of the Spectrum Management Agency's public inquiry will lead to significant licence fee increases. Changes to the fees for amateur radio operators are part of broader changes to apparatus licences. Under the proposal contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the apparatus licence system: a new outlook</EMPHASIS>, released in February, the fees for apparatus licences are to be based on a combination of the administrative and maintenance costs of issuing the licence and a tax component based on the value of the spectrum used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many apparatus licence users will see fee reductions under this formula, including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, state governments and taxi services, but some fees, such as amateur fees, were likely to increase under the draft proposal, as published. Most amateurs were paying $37 per annum but under the formula being applied to apparatus licences in general, their annual fee would have risen by between $8 and $34 to a maximum of $71. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the implementation processes for establishing a new apparatus licence regime, it has always been intended that a final round of consultation would take place before fees were set.

This will reduce the fee from the proposed $71 to $51 per annum. The fee would be applied to all amateur licensees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During 1994 a review of radiocommunications apparatus licensing was conducted by the Spectrum Management Agency. One of the recommendations arising from that review was that a wider variety of payment options be made available to avoid the necessity for regular annual licence tax payments when the licence term exceeds one year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the only payment option available to holders of apparatus licences is to make annual tax payments throughout the duration of the licence. Under the legislation now before the House, the Spectrum Management Agency will be able to offer various payment options to licence applicants. Where licences have a duration of less than 12 months, the licence fee will be payable at issue as is currently the case.Licences of more than 12 months duration will attract a number of payment options, which have been set out by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its discussion paper on the apparatus licensing system in December 1993, the Spectrum Management Agency revealed that approximately 40 per cent of licence renewals are processed late, generally because of late payment. Under these amendments, the Spectrum Management Agency, the SMA, will be given the power to make disallowable instruments which will set interest penalties on outstanding amounts. In the explanatory memorandum to the amendments it is stated that the SMA will impose financial penalties for non-payment, rather than suspend or cancel licences, which at present are the only sanctions available to it. These amendments will commence upon the acts being proclaimed, which will allow for any slippage in the commissioning of the SMA's new RADCOM computer records system, which will be required to process the new applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill and the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill as the measures in them are uncontroversial. The only question which does arise is the capability of the SMA to handle the licensing procedures and administer the changes in taxation. The Spectrum Management Agency recently increased the licence fees for amateur radio services throughout the community. As the government is plainly aware from the speech we have just heard from the parliamentary secretary, its move to do so prompted an outcry from amateur radio operators around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition clearly recognises the contribution which amateur radio services make to the community, particularly the assistance which these services provide in emergency situations, and the support provided to other community organisations. Until recently, this contribution has been recognised by the amateur radio licence fee structure and, as recently as 1992, when the Radiocommunications Act came into force, one of its objectives was to include `adequate provision for use by public or community services' and a `responsive and flexible approach to meeting the needs of users'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals to increase licence fees for amateur radio services was initially put forward by the government without, in our view, any proper consultation or publicly stated and convincing justification. The Spectrum Management Agency failed to adequately explain how it arrived at the proposed fee levels. Although we are now told by the parliamentary secretary what these fees will cover, it is still not entirely clear just how the fee levels have been arrived at and why the fees that are now being announced differed from the fees which were originally put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only assume that the changes that have been made were in response to the public outcry which accompanied the initial announcements. Once again, we see the way in which the government is making policy on the run in accordance with and in response to pressures within the community rather than on any sound basis which can be clearly argued and justified to this parliament and to the amateur radio operators in the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for communications, Senator Alston, indicated that he was attempting to ascertain from the Spectrum Management Agency its reasons for increases in amateur licence fees and the reason for an increase of the magnitude which was proposed. The conclusion has to be drawn that amateur operators have the misfortune to be a disciplined, individual licence service and, therefore, an easy target for revenue raising by the government, which as we know is engaged at the moment in a quite desperate effort to raise revenue to close the enormous gap between its spending and its revenue raising. We have seen a very clumsy effort by the government in this case, across the board, in attempting to rationalise the spectrum and in attempting to make decisions about the way in which this will be paid for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Spectrum Management Agency's reticence to provide answers to the questions which have been put to it by the shadow minister, and the way in which the amateur licensing issue generally has been handled by the government is, I regret to say, a part of the government's overall, exceedingly bad performance in the communications area. It seems that this area is constantly before this parliament as one requiring substantial criticism from our side of the House and one which is arousing a great deal of concern throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the pay TV debacle presided over by the same minister who oversaw the recent woodchipping embarrassment. We have seen the current problems in this area with the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) under censure from this side of the House within the last 24 hours. A general record of incompetence and unsatisfactory, politically driven policy making has become characteristic of the communications area. It is a disgrace. I regret to say that the instability in government decisions in relation to licence fees for amateur operators is simply the latest example of the government's inability to put policy in this area on a sound basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the opposition will not be opposing this legislation, on behalf of the coalition I put the Spectrum Management Agency on notice that we will be monitoring its activities extremely closely and, likewise, the decisions that the minister will be taking in this area in the future. </PARA>

<PARA>Fine, except that Mr McKechnie wants to be prosecutor, jury and judge. I think the behaviour we are seeing from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is a matter of grave concern in Western Australia, where we are seeing people charged and acquitted by the courts at great expense. In one case that comes to mind, where Mr McKechnie personally saw that prosecution go ahead against a gentleman in Bunbury, the evidence was based entirely on repressed memory, a very dangerous situation indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am personally aware of a situation with an Aboriginal fellow I know who is doing a two-year jail sentence for rape. The only evidence that the public prosecutor had came from a woman who came to my office, seeking to change her testimony. She was, in fact, the niece of the person charged. That woman was subjected to harassment by the police and her pleas to change her testimony were ignored by the department of public prosecutions. The case went to trial and hers was the only evidence the prosecution had. There was no supporting evidence whatsoever. He was convicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I actually gave evidence on this fellow's behalf. He is a fellow who was guilty of what I term `blackfella' crime&mdash;disorderliness, drinking, fighting&mdash;but nothing that was of great seriousness, except for a couple of rape charges, one of which he had skipped bail on. He was on Australia's most wanted list for this for eight years. When it eventually came to court the advice of the Aboriginal Legal Service was, of course, to plead guilty. I got him a defence, which I arranged to pay for, and he was acquitted. The judge threw it out of court. It should never have been there. In my view, it went back to internecine feuding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with the latest case, I gave evidence in the court. Looking at the jury, I could see how racism actually works. I am on record as saying that Australia is probably the most tolerant country in the world. In fact, I would say it is certainly the most tolerant country in the world. Racism occurs from time to time and it is manifested in this way: a young white jury looked at him and thought, `If he didn't do it, some other Aboriginal did. And, if he didn't do it there, he probably did it somewhere else. We'll find him guilty.' I think that the judge, on the basis of the evidence, was rather stunned by the verdict because the sentence of two years was, under the circumstances, very modest. </PARA>

When I turn to more detailed data, Mr Speaker, I am sure you will agree&mdash;as a fine supporter of the University of Wollongong in your electorate of Cunningham. I turn to the data concerning asset related income earned by some of the universities in New South Wales. In 1993, the University of New South Wales earned just over $24 million in investment income from an asset base totalling over $240 million. The University of Sydney had a similar outcome, earning over $31 million from its asset base of over $440 million. </PARA>

That is, in my assessment, totally consistent with equity principles and totally consistent with the way in which we fund the states and local government. This transfer of funding would give universities that have not got the rich endowments, that have not got the rich asset base, their fair chance to service their student population. </PARA>

My information is that Australia Post would like to remove up to 1,000 boxes in Melbourne and what Australia Post calls `fringe areas'&mdash;outer suburban locations such as Cranbourne, Healesville and Melton that are still serviced by metropolitan mail centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see how a survey of the number of letters posted over one week only is a sufficient statistical basis on which to make an informed decision. Australia Post will write to all its federal members telling them of the review in their area and a notice will also be posted for a month on each of the postboxes that might be slated for removal to enable interested mail users to make representations to the mail business units. There will, however, be no advertisements in local papers to inform residents of the planned changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A small group of Australia Post officials, who may lack a good knowledge of an area and particularly peaks and troughs in mail posting, will make decisions that affect people who irregularly stop on the way home from work to post their business letters and residents who write letters, send Christmas cards or birthday cards, send bills, payments or small articles through their local mailbox. No-one in the community will be involved in the decision making. A street posting box that in one week of survey falls just below the necessary number of articles might be removed only to massively inconvenience the people, especially the older members, of our community who would like to walk to their nearest postbox in slightly busier times or peak periods such as Christmas, when large numbers of items are posted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not arguing that no changes should be made, but it would appear that Australia Post is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of its customers who are posting increasing volumes of mail. Australia Post should improve the maintenance of its street posting boxes by assigning its pick-up drivers particular boxes to clean of any graffiti and they should install additional boxes in some of the newer states, such as at Cranbourne West, where some residents have no box available within 1.5 to 2 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, I call on all Melbourne residents to be aware that their local mailbox may be under threat and to not only watch for the appearance of the notices proposing the removal but also patronise the mailboxes so that an important community asset can be maintained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a state election coming up in New South Wales. We heard today in the parliament, in answer to a question I asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), what a sham the actions of the New South Wales government have been. It has opened about 45 schools in the last 1 1/2 months, which is 4 1/2 times as many as were opened in the first half of last year. There have been 45 school openings with 72 per cent Commonwealth funds. Yet the New South Wales government has deliberately manipulated some of these openings so that federal members in the electorates concerned could not attend. The state, of course, takes the credit for this federal government money going to opening schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only in the area of education that the Fahey government has been shown for the sham that it is, particularly in relation to Commonwealth-state relations and the spending of federal government money. I have been heard in this House many times before talking about the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement and how the Fahey government has refused to sign that agreement for the last five years. Certainly since before the last state election, the New South Wales government has refused to sign the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement, thereby denying the young people in the growing areas, like the ones that I represent, access to very important child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fahey seems to be a bit confused about this because he told a journalist yesterday that the agreement with the federal government was signed and that the New South Wales government was very much party to it. He told the journalist to ignore the nonsense from Canberra on this issue. He was asked when it was signed and he said, `Several weeks ago&mdash;from memory before Christmas. I can't recall exactly when, but several weeks ago.' The journalist asked him again and he said, `The federal Minister for Family Services, Rosemary Crowley, should check it and we have signed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Mr Fahey was wrong. The opposition in New South Wales checked with Senator Crowley's office and found that, in fact, the Fahey government has still not signed the child-care agreement, despite having promised, as I predicted in this House last September, a raft of new child-care places, which is virtually a reannouncement of the same child-care places that the federal government has wanted to fund for the last four years but has not been able to deliver because the New South Wales government has refused to sign the agreement. </PARA>

His big plans for the launch of his women's policy on International Women's Day today were completely derailed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I take the opportunity to speak on the report from the Department of Social Security entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Data-matching Program</EMPHASIS>. I particularly want to ensure that the social security aspects of the report do not pass without comment. Data matching has been an important issue over a long period. It is important not to lose sight of the assurances that were given by the government at the time data matching was developing. It was the view of the parliament that data matching, because of its intrusive nature, ought not to proceed without question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read again an Australian Labor Party policy speech which was made in 1984. It was made after some changes had been made in the area of assets and income testing and the government wanted to reassure people about the likely impact of its new assets test. One ought not to forget these things and it is interesting to look back at some of the government's comments. The government gave commitments, firstly, that people would never see social security inspectors in their homes, and, secondly, that information gathered for the purposes of the assets test would not be used for any other revenue purpose. Interestingly enough, the third commitment was that the assets test will not be made more stringent by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second of those assurances that the government gave, data matching is the basis upon which information is provided for the assets test. It also provides all the government's information for the purposes of testing eligibility and for saving revenue in relation to Social Security and to other government departments. Of course, information is provided under this legislation to other agencies for their purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue which was adverted to was that the assets test would not be made more stringent. I do not know what the government is intending to do in the context of the forthcoming budget but it is interesting that one of the major issues relating to stringency was the extent to which unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments were treated as income for the purposes of the income test. If that did not mean that the tests were not given greater stringency, I do not know what was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the assurances that were given, the government moved rigorously and enthusiastically into this area of data matching. It gave certain assurances as to what it thought would result from the implementation of data matching. It predicted that the data-matching program would result in something of the order of $300 million in savings. That was in 1992-93. Over time, the department downgraded its savings estimates. It did so in Senate estimates to a $70 million figure. At a later point, when the matter was the subject of a more detailed comprehensive review by the Auditor-General in the efficiency audit, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit report No. 7 1993-94</EMPHASIS>, that was downgraded even further to a saving of $17.3 million in that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to go back and look at what was being said. The parliament has been saying that data matching was intrusive; there needed to be very significant cost benefit to proceed with a program that was going to be intrusive and it was necessary to be able to demonstrate that. Of course, the demonstration was to be occasioned by detailed and comprehensive reports and the role of the Auditor-General was crucial in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sunset clause was also placed in the legislation, a clause that the government keeps on wanting to take out and that the opposition in its usual cooperative way has extended to give the government an opportunity to come up with a proper justification for the data-matching program implementation and to demonstrate its effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is important in the context of looking at the paper that we have before us today to review what the Auditor-General had to say, particularly in relation to benefits. On page 11 of the report's summary&mdash;and I think it is easier to understand it in that context&mdash;the Auditor-General made this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original estimate supporting the introduction of the Data-Matching Program suggested full-year savings of $300m per annum. The estimate did not include savings arising through partial downward variations in fortnightly rates or recovery of overpayments. These original saving estimates were not achieved, and were revised downwards in October 1992, and again this year.</PARA>
<PARA>And the report went on to make the point that I made earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The downward variations in payments, which were the basis of the original estimates, represent only $17m of the 1992-93 savings of $75m (as at the date of the audit).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that the value of overpayments is likely to reduce in future years. As a consequence DSS has reduced the value of overpayment amounts since projected savings estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>It talked about the `deterrent effect' because the department argued that if you proceed with data matching, while the savings may not be so significant, it would have a deterrent effect, which would in fact save money. The Auditor-General had some comments to make about that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the audit, there had been no effective estimates of the deterrent effect of the DMP. Whilst recognising the difficulties in isolating and quantifying the deterrent effect due to the DMP (and TFN collection), the ANAO considers that a more considered evaluation of this effect is necessary both for assessing program savings and the costs/ benefits of the program.</PARA>
<PARA>The report indicated that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department will be presenting available evidence in its October 1993 Progress Report.</PARA>
<PARA>And it made some comments on program performance, some comparisons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Program performance is variable when examined across a spectrum of baselines. It is effective in its identification of overpayments, reflecting benefits which have been incorrectly paid for some time. The program is also effective in identifying incorrect family payments not detected by other DSS review methods. This reinforces the view that the program provides a valuable vehicle for review of client circumstances that would not otherwise be as readily detected.</PARA>
<PARA>But it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the data-matching program outcomes have fallen well short of DSS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">predictions. Current circumstances in the client population together with changes in DSS control and review activities may have contributed to the shortfall in achieving predicted outcomes for the program. These considerations, as well at the unquantified deterrent effect, make conclusions about the overall cost effectiveness of the program difficult, and reinforce the need for a more comprehensive cost/benefit analysis. They also highlight the scope for more efficiency to be pursued in Data-matching work.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important to recognise the nature of those comments because the department was being very severely criticised by the Auditor-General. It was not satisfied that there had been an effective cost-benefit analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have the department's report on data matching, which attempts to deal with these matters, and I simply want to make some comments on that. The first concerns the fraud control strategy. The department, on page 5, is saying that data matching is now not an important end in itself. It now puts the first point of emphasis on encouraging voluntary compliance. So we are moving away from the idea that one can justify the argument that there are effective savings resulting from data matching, because the evidence is that that has not been achieved, to the more esoteric view that one can justify it because we are getting additional compliance that we would not otherwise have got, because people are more afraid that they might be ascertained by the effectiveness of the data matching the department is undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the report deals with detecting people who are receiving incorrect payments, as a secondary matter. Verifying the accuracy of incomes declared is shown as being of even lesser importance, and the final matter is the detection of fictitious or assumed identities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to recognise that, because the department has produced some tables. In the appendices that I find particularly interesting&mdash;on page 81, at table 5&mdash;was the direct cost-benefit summary. What one sees there is that there is a persistent view that there is going to be a very high level of direct cost-benefit. Looking at the net benefit figure for 1993-94, the government's view was that it was going to be $63 million&mdash;still nowhere near the $300 million originally held out. What is interesting is the way in which that tails off. In 1994-95, the department thinks, it is going to drop to $38 million; in 1995-96, it will drop to $23 million. I do not know how these figures were achieved, but one must consider them somewhat random, because they are the same for 1996-97 and 1997-98&mdash;a mere $21,183,000 for each of those years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What one sees is an effort to develop a cost-benefit summary which includes savings associated with voluntary compliance, and that comes out in table 6. Of course, what one sees there in the projections is an estimate that voluntary compliance is yielding something in the order of $42 million worth of savings, and that it will go up next year, such that we will still get approximately the same total amount of savings even though the direct cost is falling. The voluntary savings will go up to $71 million and, in the following year, to $83 million. Again, in 1996-97 and 1997-98, it is going to go to a similar figure for each year: there, it is rounded off to $90 million. So the government seems to have set out the rather imaginative view that there can be direct cost-benefit analysis&mdash;including voluntary compliance, which is going to yield somewhere between $120 million and $130 million a year, ad infinitum&mdash;and has rounded off some of the future projections to achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My problem is that I do not know how accurate those matters are. I read with great interest the way in which the department tried to deal with the criticism developed by the Auditor-General. In chapter 4, there is an assessment of the program. It deals with the Australian National Audit Office efficiency audit. As one goes through each of the recommendations that the audit office made, one finds a series of fairly esoteric arguments in which the department is taking issue with the audit office. Page 29 indicates that they are having `discussions'. But, at the bottom of page 29, the report states that the department has:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . disagreed that recording individual project costs would help identify effective projects.</PARA>
<PARA>What one finds is a series of conflicts&mdash;almost interdepartmental conflicts&mdash;between the specialists of the Department of Social Security and the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not able to resolve these matters. It is clear that the Department of Social Security is using this report for taking issue with the Auditor-General, but there are no further Auditor-General's comments. I want to conclude my remarks in relation to this matter by noting that there was a report of the Auditor-General tabled yesterday and that report did not deal with this matter, but it did reveal poor performance in relation to others. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I would like to bring people's notice to the very beginning when the Australian National Audit Office report indicated that the program is a valuable compliance and control technique which addresses areas of risk and which other review activities do not cover as effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted that the savings originally estimated may not have been achieved. We acknowledge that, but the Audit Office has confirmed that the department and the data-matching agency effectively&mdash;and I emphasise that, effectively&mdash;fulfil their obligations under the act and certainly under the privacy guidelines. I think that is a very important point to make because the department as a whole, since data-matching came into being with a change to the act of 1991, has very effectively brought about changes to the whole structure of how we monitor and perhaps control fraud within the department itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data-matching program itself is designed to correct incorrect payments of income support. Of course, that is done by the checking of the integrity of the information that people provide to us about their identity. They provide the information on identity but they also provide information as required on income. The program itself is also used to identify those in receipt of basic family payment who have declared income to the Australian Taxation Office and who may be eligible for extra assistance in the form of additional family payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that that cross-checking is only done with the concurrence of the person. In all but exceptional cases our Department of Social Security does contact those who are the subject of an apparent match, to verify information before they even contact a third party. I think that is important to note. It is also important to note that there have been occasions where those people who are perhaps entitled to family payments have not been receiving them, and we have been able to detect that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra made mention of some of the tables in the report, and I think it is pertinent to look at those. In 1993-94 five data-matching cycles were conducted and 61,636 reviews of entitlement produced substantial direct savings of $79.8 million. I do not think that is small bickies. A lot of taxpayers' money has been saved because of the action we have taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, there is evidence that the level of voluntary compliance with the social security system has increased since the department began collecting tax file numbers and using them in the data-matching program. In one of our reports we have the estimate that on an ongoing basis an annual amount of about $120 million will be saved through people voluntarily surrendering their payments. In other words, they are aware of the action the Department of Social Security now takes. They are being given a backup of assurance that, if the information that is being provided is in any way incorrect, through data matching we have means at our disposal with which to pick that up. All in all, Mr Deputy Speaker, the report covers very succinctly those particular cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people say, `Why have we ever had a need of it? Are you saying that people either fraudulently or incorrectly are receiving these payments?' No system we have which actually administers taxpayer's dollars, whether it be the Department of Social Security's system or any other system, can always be 100 per cent perfect. We try continually in the department to monitor the programs that we have in place, but most particularly we try to be observant of changes both in technology and in the receipt of information which can be utilised to make sure that that protection to the taxpayer's dollar is there at all times. The honest people who receive the payment&mdash;the honest people who make up 99.9 per cent of the population who are receiving payments for the Department of Social Security&mdash;appreciate this. Time and time again we have had both individuals and bodies praise the Department of Social Security for the very sure way in which it has administered this particular data-matching program. Most particularly, there is praise for the very caring way in which the department's officers have gone about their role; and certainly, in the requiring of information and evidence, there is praise for the way it has been treated privately. Most particularly, there is praise for the savings that have been afforded, as this report indicates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for Berowra for his statement that he certainly appreciates sections of the report and what has been achieved by them; but I think that rather than being critical just of certain lines and taking certain paragraphs out of context, which he has a tendency to do, what is required is the taking on board of the whole report. We must not just summarise a line in the report. It is far more beneficial to the appreciation both of the reader and of any person who may be listening to this debate to take on board the whole report. It is very easy for all of us to take a line or a sentence and then misconstrue the meaning, whether it is the auditor's meaning or the department's meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all fairness, the report itself, as tabled in the House, is a very fair report. Certainly, at no time have we ever said that we are 100 per cent perfect, but we are acknowledging the work that has been achieved. We have brought to light, as required, the achievements within the department on the processes of the matching as far as it affects Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We compare the clients' identity details with the records of a number of other Commonwealth and state bodies and private insurers. We do that mainly to identify income changes or even changes in circumstances which clients may not have declared. I am not saying that at all times they do it purposely; sometimes inadvertently a client may not put in all the particulars required. That is where the data-matching process comes into being. It is a very good backup for the Department of Social Security. Most particularly, it provides the department with the means to monitor at all times, and respond to those numerous questions that are always being asked by the population at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we sure that our taxpayers' dollars are being spent wisely? We have very much a needs based payment system. Because of the safety net that the Department of Social Security has, there is a need to make sure that we are giving those payments to those who are in need and to those who require them. That is what this, as part of our program of implementation, is all about. I certainly appreciate the report being brought before the Main Committee, because it enables us to put forward those extra facts that may not be written into the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, perhaps I may just advert to the matter that has just been concluded indirectly by saying that I hope that we may see a further Auditor-General's report on the matters that are at issue. I think that is particularly important if we are able to make sensible conclusions on the disparities that I raised. I turn particularly to the issue of the paper that we are now discussing, which is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Performance standards 1993-94</EMPHASIS> for the Department of Social Security. Since that document was tabled and discussion was adjourned I have seen the proposals for 1994-95 performance standards, and in my comments I will draw attention to both documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a number of comments on this because the issue of performance in the Department of Social Security is of the utmost importance. The timeliness with which people receive their payments is a matter for which one ought not only have targets&mdash;which these papers give us&mdash;but also actual performance. I am a touch surprised. There were some changes between 1993 and 1994, and one of the interesting changes was that we had for the disability support pension in 1993-94 a target to pay, within 56 days of the claim, only 60 per cent of the claims made. In the new document that has been raised to 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider the importance of this particular payment: it is, in effect, the payment made to severely handicapped people. When you consider that we have something of the order of 400,000 people receiving the disability support pension, given this target, it would suggest that in 1993-94, if they had all been coming onto the pension at that time&mdash;and perhaps they were not, but if they all had been&mdash;somewhere in the order of 160,000 people would have had to wait longer than 56 days before receiving their first payment. That is an incredible degree of hardship that people who are, prima facie, in very difficult circumstances are going to have to face. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is significant testing, and it involves other government departments, and I would imagine that that is probably the reason that it takes so long&mdash;because, no doubt, one has to get advice from medical officers, and the Commonwealth medical officers are involved&mdash;but it does reflect upon the performance, and that is what we are looking at. In relation to the child disability allowance, which is a similar matter, 56 days is the time thought reasonable for considering claims, so it is quite a long time&mdash;almost two months&mdash;and 80 per cent is the target.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one starts to measure these claims against performance&mdash;and one has to go to some other documents that are produced in the budget to look at performance issues&mdash;it is very interesting that, in relation to the child disability allowance, the report commenting on 1992-93 had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The timeliness standard for the Child Disability Allowance (CDA) is to pay claims within 56 days of lodgement. The target for meeting this standard is that 80 per cent of claims paid are paid inside the standard. Collection of data against this standard only commenced in September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1992-93 financial year performance result (since September 1992) for CDA is that 62 per cent of claims paid were paid inside standard</PARA>
<PARA>So the government is saying that even though they had a target of 80 per cent, they were only able to achieve payment of 62 per cent of the claims within that time. The comments I want to make here relate not only to the importance of meeting standards but also to satisfying the relevant criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that, in fact, in an effort to address performance, certain changes have occurred in relation to the way in which these matters are considered. It is interesting that, when one looks at the program performance statements of the department, one finds that the largest area of health that is considered for qualifying for the disability allowance is, in fact, asthma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asthma can be a particularly serious disability. I have known very close family friends who have lost loved ones through asthma. It can be quite tragic, but the very nature of it means that it can also be very mild. Some of it comes and goes. When my daughter was swimming actively she was seen as an asthma sufferer and was given one of those little squeezer things. There is no doubt that for a point in time she was a mild sufferer of asthma, but, if we were recipients of social security payments, given the nature of the condition that she had, there is no way that the child disability allowance would have been payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told, in order to get the performance up, what has been happening is that a lot of the determinations in relation to eligibility for this payment are being made by social workers. In other words, if people refer the claimant to the Commonwealth medical officer it reflects upon their performance. When people are worried about their performance, they do not send the person on for assessment&mdash;the social worker makes the claim. It is interesting that the claims for asthma, where the judgment can be so esoteric, have been rising rapidly, as can be seen in the performance statements which the government produces. In relation to performance standards, I am concerned that the government tells us in the paper that is tabled what the target is, but to find out what the performance is we have to hunt in other documents. </PARA>

I would also like to know why we are seeing certain changes occurring. What I found particularly interesting in the 1993-94 program statement on page 2, under `Review and Appeals', is that there was a national standard when matters were raised between authorised review officers. The statement says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Standard</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14 days to finalise (where the client left without income) after request lodged at Regional Office&mdash;95%</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14 days to finalise after request lodged at Regional Office (all types of review) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And there the objective is only to achieve it by 40 per cent. When I look at the 1994-95 performance standards, and I look at that particular table, I find that there has been a change. They now leave out altogether the area in which the target is low at 40 per cent. So people now cannot find out. There is no target for 14 days to finalise after request lodged at regional office for all types of reviews. There has been a continuation with the other national standards where people are left without adequate means of support, but, in relation to the 14 days to finalise, that information is no longer provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest I run out of time again, I will move quickly to the concern I have as to what happened over the Christmas period in relation to performance. One of the concerns I have is that these tables with targets suggest a very high level of performance by the Department of Social Security, but over the Christmas period I was really quite concerned when it became apparent that the Department of Social Security was telling people that it was too busy to be able to process claims. We had something of the order of 42,000 families that the department acknowledged had been affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have copies of the letters that were sent out by people in the department at that time. What they did was send out letters which told people that they were, in effect, unable to process their review forms. A letter about family payments that I have before me, dated 19 December, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you about your Family Payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot pay you Additional Family Payment and Family Payment any more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is because, although you have returned the review form we sent you, we have been unable to process it yet. We will process your review form as soon as possible and you will be paid any arrears owing to you. If you have not received your payment by 19 January 1995 or you want to know more about your Family Payment, please phone the number at the top of this letter after that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been decided under section(s) 880 of the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>I find it absolutely abhorrent that, at a time like Christmas when people had additional commitments they would ordinarily be expected to meet, the department was unable to process information that it had sought and received, and that it simply took people off benefits. It said, `If you are still entitled, we will put you back'&mdash;at some later date. But at the very time when hardship was most likely to have been endured, people were left without funds.</PARA>

It is quite indefensible that it occurred, and it reflects very poorly upon the department, and on the government's administration of the department, that that could happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You see, the department was out on a massive recruiting drive over the last few years. The department has record numbers of staff&mdash;something of the order of 21,000 people. We are at a time when the government tells us that unemployment is coming off. In that situation, it could have been expected that people who would otherwise have been paying unemployment benefits would have been freed of those tasks and the government could have prioritised this activity, which was crucial to people's income support over the Christmas period, if it was really concerned about the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, when the test came, the government was wanting. When the test was there, the government wanted to hide it; it did not want people to know. There were no press statements on it. I watch what the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) says. There were no statements by the minister on this matter. I asked the minister to come out and speak on it himself, at that time. And what did he do? He sent out the departmental officers to make the explanations. I regard it as a very poor standard of performance. We need to hear a lot more from the government, not only in terms of the standards that are set, but also in terms of the need for them to publish comprehensive details about the way in which they measure up against these performance standards. That is the information that is not available; it is effectively hidden. </PARA>

If its performance is up to standard, I would be the first to congratulate the government on it.

As a member of the Procedure Committee, I want to start by making the observation that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) ought to be here for this particular debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the creation of the Main Committee as the second chamber of the House of Representatives, we on the opposition side were at great pains to point out that unless this chamber were treated seriously it would become a second-class debating forum in which whatever occurs is treated as second best, or of less significance than a debate occurring in the House itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It behoves the minister to come into the Main Committee. Perhaps he would find it a little bit degrading to come here and listen to this debate and take note of the comments being made by members participating, because he would then learn of the immense difficulties being experienced by Australians all round the country in relation to social security entitlements and the departmental service. He would also learn of some of the comments and complaints of his own staff, who, in the case of the Joondalup Department of Social Security office, are working under enormous strains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time one listens to the minister in the chamber, when he is asked a dorothy dix question and makes some lengthy dissertation on the social progress being made, or talks of the social justice of this government. He would no doubt be mindful of the conference that is taking place in Copenhagen in relation to social justice. But I imagine also that he would be very defensive if we were to point out, as we have done from time to time&mdash;I know the honourable member for Berowra has done so&mdash;that under this government we have seen an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor in our community, a community that, when I arrived here in 1971, was renowned for its fairness and equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first arrived in this country there was little difference in real terms between the salaries, or the standard of living, of people who were in middle management or in responsible positions, and those people who had physical jobs or service jobs. Unfortunately we have seen, in particular since 1983, following the election of the federal Labor governments under Hawke and Keating, an ever-widening gap between the poor and the rich in Australia, to such an extent that there are now about 8 1/2 million people in this nation who depend, either in full or in part, on some form of income from the Commonwealth government. In a modern, vibrant democracy, with all the resources that we have available to our community, that is obviously a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grinding edge of this particular problem is at the front counter of the DSS office. In my electorate&mdash;which has within it the fast growing region of the city of Wanneroo&mdash;12,000 new people arrive each year. This is an increase of approximately 10 per cent each year. As a consequence, there is an enormous strain on the services that are available within our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have within the electorate of Moore the highest concentration of children up to the age of five. We also have one of the highest concentrations of children between the ages of five and 15. Significantly&mdash;or ironically I suppose&mdash;we also have the greatest concentration of four-bedroom homes, but I do not think that has got as much to do with prosperity, as it has with the number of children being raised in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, in my electorate there is a great demand for services from the Commonwealth government and, in particular, from the Department of Social Security. At various times I have become aware of significant problems with the office at Joondalup. The problems are those referred to by the member for Berowra: the difficulty in the interpretation of rulings and particular criteria, and also the sheer increase in demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently became aware that people were being referred to me by staff at the department's Joondalup office. Because their cases were difficult, they were being told, `You really ought to go and see your local MP.' In my constituency office, we take a great deal of pride in providing a good service to our constituents but I might say that this is placing quite a bit of strain on my office. We are basically having to deal with the by-product of the enormous strain on the Department of Social Security's office at Joondalup. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to commend the staff at the Joondalup office of the Department of Social Security. They are working under extraordinary pressure. All I can do on their behalf is ask that the parliamentary secretary and, through her, the minister look immediately at the workload that is being undertaken by officers at the Joondalup office to see whether there is some way to alleviate this additional strain so that the office can provide a better standard of service to my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also raised the issue of the teleservice centre with the parliamentary secretary. In fairness to her&mdash;and I meant no personal reflection when I mentioned the minister&mdash;I must say that she has been prompt in responding to my queries and I appreciate that on behalf of my constituents. I complained to her about the teleservice centre arrangements. This is another issue that, as she would know from her own constituents, causes almost insufferable frustration on the part of people who are trying to get though on the help line to get basic information. Because of the rapid changes in circumstances in the Department of Social Security, or because of changes in the various legislation within the department's jurisdiction, people require&mdash;as much as possible&mdash;instant service so that they can take full advantage of their entitlements, even when changes occur sometimes in circumstances that may well militate against the individual constituent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that, with respect to the office at Joondalup, I have had complaints from people who have recently had to wait up to 1 1/2 hours to get attention there. I think that is something that I would like to see remedied as quickly as possible. Again, I make no reflection on the staff at the office. I know many of them personally and I have a great deal of respect for them. I know that they are operating in difficult circumstances and that they are endeavouring to do their best on behalf of my constituents. Nonetheless, I would like to see the situation improved as quickly as possible. </PARA>

I want to address a matter that continues to represent a gross injustice for another group of people in my electorate. They have suffered as a consequence of joint exercises conducted by the department, the DSS, the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Federal Police. In 1991, some so-called `visits'&mdash;they were actually raids&mdash;were made to some strawberry growers in my electorate. Only a small number were visited, or raided, but as a consequence of those visits or raids many of their workers fled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go into great detail about why these people may have felt alarmed or intimidated by the presence of police officers and other officers in the early hours of the morning at the strawberry fields in my electorate. All I can say is that many of those workers came from countries that have long suffered under Communist regimes. I believe they have a natural instinct to feel afraid or worried in the presence of authoritarian or authoritative officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of these raids, my constituents' strawberry picking period&mdash;the peak period which is in the latter part of the year, in the summer&mdash;was severely impeded by the then consequent lack of labour. In some instances, constituents lost up to $1.5 million&mdash;in particular, one particular constituent who is the largest strawberry grower in Western Australia. He suffered the most and he has ever since been trying to exact justice as a consequence of these losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point out some of the things that this gentleman has had to do. I have spoken on a number of occasions here in relation to this matter. I have made representations to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott). I have spoken in previous debates on data-matching programs and I have made interminable representations. One particular thing I did was to take out freedom of information requests in relation to the Australian Taxation Office relating to meetings that had been held&mdash;I will show members where this is relevant&mdash;with officers of the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security and the Australian Federal Police prior to these raids taking place. To my great consternation, when seeking these freedom of information documents, we could find no evidence of the notes of the meetings that had taken place with the officers of the three bodies. In particular, these notes would have related to or reflected upon the actual complaints&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not a long bow. These people had losses of $1.5 million in one particular case. What I am saying is this: in this particular instance, officers of the three bodies have failed to keep notes of meetings in which allegations against my constituents&mdash;or, for that matter, others&mdash;have allegedly been raised and discussed. That means that my constituent was unable to seek further information that would allow him to take legal action in order to get retribution for the enormous financial losses he has suffered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I implored the previous Minister for Social Security, the Hon. Neal Blewett, to look at this matter with a sympathetic view towards an ex gratia payment of compensation to those of my constituents who have suffered these losses. The reason I asked for this is, quite frankly, that they were entirely innocent parties. There has been no allegation of offences against them and no charges, nor has there been any suggestion of charges. Yet this situation was a consequence of this joint exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that the Department of Social Security strangely dropped out of the exercise at the last moment. My constituent had actually complained to the Department of Social Security prior to the raids taking place. The DSS officers dropped out of the exercise and only ATO and AFP officers were present at the time. Nonetheless, it was a joint exercise and I can only urge the parliamentary secretary to ask for that matter to be looked at again. I am only too happy to provide the particulars so that she may do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, may I just urge, as I urged earlier, the parliamentary secretary&mdash;who I know is an efficient person&mdash;to make the necessary inquiries to ascertain what extra resources are required at Joondalup and to make sure the minister is aware of the grinding edge, as we said, of that new problem area we find with this unfortunate greater dependency of many Australians on social security payments. At the front counter where these performance standards are supposedly being measured people should have equal access to highly efficient service from the department's officers. In areas like Joondalup and Wanneroo where the growth is so phenomenal, those resources should be beefed up to the maximum to ensure that people do get equal access and fair access to the service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not originally going to reply but a number of points have been made both by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) so I feel it is necessary to reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I will start with what the honourable member for Moore has raised. I had to look again at the Main Committee's agenda. It is clearly marked as `Department of Social Security&mdash;Performance standards 1993-94'. He did use a very broad brush to bring in the concerns he had in 1991. It would be on the record that in the department we were not even publishing our standards until 1992. It does take a lot of understanding to see how what the member was talking about related to the actual report before the Main Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other points have been raised. Certainly, I will investigate them on his behalf. He has raised concerns, as a member rightfully should, over a particular office within his electorate. I do also take note of the teleservice centres. This is something that is continually being reviewed within the department. But I would put my comments on record as to why that review is constantly taking place in the teleservice centres. I agree with the honourable member about frustration arising when people cannot get on, and they get a busy signal. That is something that we are always bringing to notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the idea of having a teleservice centre was first agreed to in 1992, and we then started erecting the centres around Australia. I believe that one of the things we must look at now, as we divide our areas up, is having a teleservice centre in every one of those areas and having area managers take more note of what is happening, particularly in relation to the distribution of the labour force in the areas at the time of need. But, at the same time, we must acknowledge that there are something like 15 million calls expected to go through our teleservice centres this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teleservice centres started as an idea to relieve the pressure on our counter staff. They have evolved to such an extent that I now feel sure that if people are an hour late in getting their age pension payments they are ringing up our teleservice centres. We are certainly looking at our voice review units, to see whether there is some way we can get an extra message on. We have changed the lines, as honourable members are aware. We have given more direct lines to pensioners. We are also continually looking at the available technology and at the possibility that we have not got enough Telecom lines coming through in certain areas. We are continually monitoring the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware of the concern of the constituents, because that is continually being raised in the department and by all members of the House. It is certainly something we are doing our best to overcome. We acknowledge that there is a problem there. But we also must acknowledge that if complaints come to our offices&mdash;there are something like 147 members of parliament&mdash;there are perhaps two or three of them, while there are up to 300,000 or 400,000 calls going through, at that one particular time, around Australia. So the number of complaints coming in is not large in comparison to the number of calls going through the centres. Nevertheless, they are a cause of concern and, if they are a cause of concern, they need investigation. We certainly need solutions to the problems that have been experienced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other areas I would like to touch on include standards. I emphasise the fact that the standards were actually put into place for publication to make sure that they provided a broad approach to improving client services for our general staff. The honourable member for Berowra touched on a number of areas that were causing concern to him, such as the disability support pension. Sure, we had originally set a target, but I think I must go on to the new figures here. The original target we set for 1993-94 was something like 60 per cent of payments within 56 days of claim. We know that that 1993-94 year reached 78 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member well knows, disability payments take a long time because they involve not only the checking of the relevant departments but also the requirement for proper health checks and ensuring that those health checks comply with what is required. Anyone can walk in with a doctor's certificate and say, `My doctor says I have got a, b and c. Therefore, I have got to go on a disability support pension.' It requires a lot more than that. It requires a very exacting decision making process, which needs to be put into place and continually updated. Certainly, it requires further medicals, and it requires medicals throughout particular time frames suitable for particular people going through the actual process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra raised the subject of asthma. I would like to see the records showing where social workers are approving disability support pension for asthmatic patients. I find that quite extraordinary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The honourable member mentioned the actual disability pensions that were being made available by social workers in regard to people suffering from asthma. I found it was rather disconcerting to have that there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue which the member for Berowra raised, which I also found a little bit disconcerting, was the child disability allowance. Again, we had set a target&mdash;something like 80 per cent&mdash;which we would have liked to have achieved within the time frame that we had set ourselves, and we did not get to that. We did get to only 70 per cent. Again, that was because there is caring approach required in order to grant a disability support pension to a child, and there is a lot of investigation required. I would not like to think, at any time, that because we have rushed through decision making some person is being denied access to a pension. But, at the same time, we must make sure that performance standards are in place, and that the payments are made accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security has published a series of client service performance standards only since 1992. It is good to have that on record and also to have on record the reason that the department is doing this. It is doing it because of this broad approach to improve our client service. The standards themselves need to be understood to appreciate why the publication is as it is. The standards are set mainly because we want to look at the timeliness and the accuracy of the decisions made to pay those particular claims, whatever they may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to continue a review on the timeliness of processing the inquiries that come through, including our telephone inquiries and office inquiries, the provision of interpreter services and ministerial correspondence. All these things are part of standards which the department sets for itself. We also want to make sure that we cover the timeliness of answers to parliamentary questions. We look at processing our reviews and appeals&mdash;that is, how authorised review officers of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are handling them and how quickly they are dealing with them. This is all part of a standard process that we are virtually policing ourselves in the department so that we can say, `We have reached our goal now; we are doing very well.' We believe, with reviews and technology, that perhaps we can do a little bit better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one of the important things is the timeliness of overpayment raising and even prosecution referral. That is why it is important to understand that standards are not just a wish list; standards and performance standards are not just there as a figure. I sometimes wonder whether we set too high a standard, particularly in the teleservice centre. I have raised this with the department and it is public knowledge. I think we need to review continually the causes of interruptions and programs and identify what is causing a particular downgrading in that standard expectation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra also raised that particular correspondence. I can assure him that he is not the only one who raised it. A number of us, including me, have raised it. Our constituents who have had this type of letter have come to us. I tell them that we look continually at review processes and at how those letters are put together. It is inexcusable; I am not defending it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Inexcusable. I am not defending it. My personal view is that no correspondence should go out to a constituent in a case like that. How many pieces of correspondence does the Department of Social Security deal with? There are something like 4 1/2 million payments of one form or another. Every time a review process is required or legislation is changed, our clients need to be notified. Correspondence is dealt with on a daily basis, let alone a weekly or a yearly basis. We can all pull out a page or a letter that one of our constituents has brought to us that can be viewed with concern. We are well aware of the particular matter that the honourable member for Berowra raised. We did not need him to raise it. It is old news; it occurred just before Christmas and it is certainly something that we are very concerned about. I give him a similar example when another review was raised in our teleservice centres. It was absolutely chock-a-block all over Australia. It occurred because the ANZ bank delayed payment of the pension at that particular time and it caused a problem, certainly a major hiccup, within our teleservice centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are critical of what our department does, we must also take on board the number of people we have to deal with; the number of people who are employed both at the counter face and through the teleservice centres; and, most particularly, the nature of the work involved in this area. While we should not have mistakes, none of us are perfect. Nor is the legislation perfect and never to be changed. I repeatedly say in Department of Social Security debates that the legislation should never be set in concrete. We should evolve: we should continue to change to meet people's needs. The same thing applies with correspondence and the way we deal with our constituents and clients. If we have a mistake, we must acknowledge that mistake, rectify it and, most importantly, make sure that that type of mistake does not occur again in the future. That is what standards are all about. In 12 months time, when we again talk about the standards that we have started to publish since 1992, if we have incurred the same problems in those same areas, we will certainly need to take on board why that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give assurance that I am continually aware of that. I know my minister is, because he at all times is very mindful of the concerns of the constituents coming to him and the types of changes and the long-term goals which we set the department for the department's people to meet and achieve. It is very much a people's department; it is very much people we are dealing with at all levels. Most particularly, the standards we set are to make sure that our department and staff meet those guidelines and meet the delivery of services to the people we are most concerned about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the data-matching program and the report from the Department of Employment, Education and Training which has been supplied to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) explaining what the position is at this stage with data processing in that department. It is a pretty important area, which we need to highlight. I understand the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) was going to speak on it earlier but obviously his other commitments have kept him from doing so. So I will just take a few moments of the Committee's time this morning to make a few points about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important things to note about the whole data-matching program is that it does not function just to pick up students who are receiving payments they are not entitled to but also looks at other ways to stop the rorting of the system. That is pretty important, as is the fact that it also serves to identify students who may be entitled to other payments. Quite often we hear that students who are looking for assistance, and rightly should have that assistance, do not know what their benefits or entitlements are. It is an important aspect of the program that they are well aware of those. The program is a powerful tool for the department to use to pursue the entitled level of financial assistance to those students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the primary function of the data-matching program remains to detect incorrect payments. That is something that, from the public accountability point of view, I think we are all aware of. Before the 1990-91 budget, data matching for cost recovery purposes was costly, time consuming and quite inefficient. That budget introduced the requirement for most people claiming government assistance to provide tax file numbers as a prerequisite to payment, which has been an important part of the data-matching program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased computerised matching of data held by various Commonwealth agencies has been of assistance here as well. It is not only the Department of Employment, Education and Training that uses the data-matching program. The Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Housing and Regional Development, and the Australian Taxation Office itself are very interested in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at some of the benefits that have come from the data-matching program, as well as the costs associated with that and the cost recovery program. The cost since 1981 has been $1.8 million; in 1993-94 it was $630,650. Of the 1993-94 cost, 83 per cent was for computer support and staff salaries. When we compare that with the savings that have been identified by the program since April 1981, it is interesting to note that $12,338,238 has been saved. When the cost factor associated with that saving is deducted, the overall net profit is $10,512,075. There are some other significant benefits. There was $102,685 identified as underpayments since 1981. That just concerns those people who have been underpaid who need that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the financial savings benefits, an efficient data-matching program provides a significant deterrent to people who would try to claim assistance for which they are ineligible. It acts as an incentive to tell the truth, which is a real plus for the public purse. The department and the government actively publish the program and publicise it, which is very important. The department is of the opinion that this has led to a significant increase in the degree of voluntary compliance among clients, particularly in the case of changing circumstances that may affect their eligibility for student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this is not the appropriate time to debate the advantages or shortcomings of the student assistance scheme, it should be appreciated that an efficient data-matching program that catches out those who are claiming undeserved assistance frees up the total pool of financial resources for those worthy students who are deserving of additional assistance. As I mentioned before, it is important that those students actually receive the assistance they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument can always be put for increasing the level of student assistance. Having four sons of my own in that field, I am reminded of it pretty regularly, particularly of course in the pursuit of our national drive for increased access to, and funding for, higher education. In states such as my own state of Queensland there is a shortage, which we keep reminding the minister about. The fact that he is addressing the problem is certainly welcomed by most Queenslanders and acknowledged by the Queensland government. However, we acknowledge that, as with everything else, the provision of funds is subject to budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, the minister has certainly made some positive statements in that area. The more money that can be provided through other means such as identifying undeserved overpayments, the more students will benefit, and we will have a pool of funds from which those in the greatest need can obtain assistance. Of course, on the other side of the coin, the application process for student assistance is large and very complex. From my family's point of view, when one of my sons went to university in Sydney one of the first things that happened was that he was given an Austudy form to fill out. As he filled it out I expressed my doubts that be would be entitled to Austudy in view of his age and my income. Sure enough, he has been through the process, is not eligible for it and obviously does not get it. I just thought it was a waste of time his going through the exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could probably find a simpler way to identify whether people are eligible&mdash;some sort of ready-reckoner for applicants to use to describe themselves&mdash;rather than have them go through the whole process and waste the time of the department when clearly there are students who are not eligible who probably could have ticked a few boxes and concluded they were not eligible for whatever reasons. That is something I would like the department to look at at some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not really relate too much to the data-matching program but I wanted to make the point that some of those forms are somewhat daunting for people to fill out as well, and it would not be surprising to discover that, because of the forms, many students would not claim all the assistance they are entitled to. It is important that those who need the assistance are encouraged to apply for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the data-matching program's ability to identify those underpayments as a significant social justice measure but we need to make sure we have that right balance. It helps those most in need, which is important to the government and to all members of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a system would benefit disadvantaged minority groups in our community. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are particularly important as far as education is concerned, and it is important that they know what is available for them and that they are encouraged to apply as well. Students from non-English speaking backgrounds also run into some difficulties from time to time, as do migrants and others from groups whose social position may have hindered them or anyone in their family from attending higher education. The whole system, at least at the outset, might appear to be something of a mystery to some of these groups, and they need to know that they should apply for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who really need the added assistance to help them improve their position and opportunities must be encouraged to do so. Many people may take such opportunities for granted but no-one on this side of the House takes access to higher education for granted, given that we had to fight for so long for it. Everyone in this House would be pleased to see the number of students who are going on to higher education now. With the number of young people finishing high school&mdash;nearly 80 per cent of secondary students&mdash;and attending some form of higher education, keeping tabs on them all would be impossible without an effective data-matching program. Using the new technologies to advance processes is extremely important, and in some areas governments need to be able to change how the technologies are used, for the benefit of all departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privacy question, of course, is something that we always need to be conscious of, to ensure that the Big Brother allegations are not highlighted and pushed too much. The Privacy Commissioner's office, of course, has conducted regular inspections of the program, and it has been important in ensuring that people do not feel intimidated in any way. I understand that the latest inspection was in 1993-94, when the Privacy Commissioner's office actually visited several of the data-matching programs around the country, and it is good that it goes out and looks at ensuring that privacy provisions are being maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take too much of the time of the committee, but I wish to make a few points in relation to this paper, and emphasise a few points about the benefits of data matching. Not only in DEET, but also in all the other departments, it is a good initiative and one which we should take the opportunity to advance, while at the same time, of course, ensuring that the individual's privacy is always respected. The main thing in this particular area is to ensure that students who need assistance actually receive that assistance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks on the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on its visit to Thailand and Laos, and I am grateful that the opportunity has been provided for the matter to be canvassed in this Main Committee. Unfortunately, I was unable to be present in the House on 27 February when the matter was debated there. The prime reason I wanted to rise was that there was a recommendation in the report which I thought needed to be addressed. The recommendation is on page 20 of the report. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the Department of Employment, Education and Training examine all the issues relevant to its funding of the National Thai Studies Centre at the Australian National University, with a view to ensuring its continued operation under conditions no less favourable than those which have applied to date.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to say a little about that recommendation and about the importance, as I see it, of maintaining a capacity for us to teach Thai in Australian universities. The Thai studies centre at the Australian National University has done an outstanding job. I understand that there is some scepticism within DEET as to whether or not funding should continue, and I think that is a great pity. From my knowledge of Thailand and the communications we have there, it is foolish for us to ignore such an important trading partner and a country so important to our relations with ASEAN, and to not have the continuity of such an excellent centre. I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before dealing with that, I want to comment on a few other aspects of the report. Obviously, in this year of remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, it was particularly moving for those of us who had not previously visited Hellfire Pass or the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery to do so. The present surrounds in the tropical Asian jungle are very benign, and it is very hard to envisage the trauma and suffering of those Australians who worked on the Burma railway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw, of course, only that small part of the railway where Weary Dunlop's ashes were scattered, where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) opened a memorial and where&mdash;thanks to the work by a number of members of the Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce, including Mr Rob Beattie and Major Allan Lowe and others&mdash;there is a very worthwhile facility which ensures that those who are Australian or have an interest in the area will be able to visit in an appropriate way. That is something that needs to be recognised more widely in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) referred to access to Hellfire Pass and to the facilities that have been installed there. The events at Hellfire Pass forged a special relationship between Thailand and Australia during World War II. It is a relationship on which we can still build in 1995 and in the years ahead. Certainly, there is recognition of the deaths of those young Australians in Thailand. The relationship that was developed at a personal level at that time gives us the opportunity to develop our relationship in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that anyone who visits a war cemetery, wherever it might be around the world, could not help but be impressed by the way in which the cemeteries are maintained. Those whose relatives died in battlefields overseas, wherever they might be, can be assured that their loved ones have been cared for in an appropriate manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation also visited Laos. The leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), has already made some observations about that visit. I will not say a great deal, except to point out that Laos is an important country in the region. It has a special relationship with Australia. We were very grateful to the Australian ambassador in Laos for his assistance during our visit, and that gratitude is referred to in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to distinguish between Thailand and Laos. As a result of the Friendship Bridge, there is greater contact between the two countries. Because the people are ethnically similar and their languages are akin, the Laotians tend to feel that they are going to be overwhelmed by the Thais. I do not think that fear is surprising, considering the nature of the respective peoples. However, it is important that Australia provides help wherever it can in developing the infrastructure which will enable Laos to develop its capacity to make decisions for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, for one, am very impressed with the way in which Australia has provided help in a meaningful way in the past. The type of AIDAB aid that has been provided needs to be developed in the future as we look at ways in which the benefits that flow from the Friendship Bridge, which crosses the Mekong, can be used to bring the countries of Asia, and certainly Laos and Thailand, closer together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Reid observed during his speech on Monday, when the delegation visited Thailand there was a good deal of controversy over a statement that had been made by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) regarding relationships between the Thai military and the Khmer Rouge. That was definitely a matter of considerable sensitivity to the Thais. Almost every person we met made some reference to that, and there were several fairly strong verbal attacks on us and on Senator Gareth Evans as a result of that comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On each of those occasions we explained the circumstances. We stressed that the matter was of real concern because of the nature of Australia's commitment to Cambodia. We said that we hoped that across-the-border aid was not being given. My concern was with the way in which Senator Gareth Evans made the remarks and then had to virtually withdraw them. I felt that that acted contrary to the way in which Australia should deal with Asian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asians are very conscious of face. I suppose we all are&mdash;and probably none more so than politicians. However, loss of face is a real problem when dealing with Asians. If an allegation is to be made, it really needs to be dealt with in a way where the accusation can be made and can be registered with those who might be able to do something about it. I was concerned about the way in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs raised the allegations about the association, and with how his withdrawal meant that it was Senator Gareth Evans who lost face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know the detail of the time at which the Thais ceased having that contact with the Khmer Rouge. But from the very reaction of the Thais, I suspect that there has been quite extensive contact between at least the Thai military and the Khmer Rouge. I do not doubt for one minute that the accuracy of Senator Evans's comment was such that he verified the comments before he made them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation indicates yet again the relevance of the recommendation we made about the National Thai Studies Centre. A recommendation I made long since to the Australian Defence Force Academy was that it should be a prerequisite that every young sailor, soldier and air force officer going through that academy have at least one year of training in an Asian language or in Asian culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is paramount that, as we move into a world where demonstrably we are going to be dealing much more significantly with Asia than we have in the past, we understand how to deal with the Asians. We have to understand that there are so many ways in which they are fundamentally different from us: not only are the languages that they speak different but also they have a different cultural base and from that culture they so often have a different vision of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who have had contact with people in Asian countries will understand that when a Japanese person, for example, says `Yes' he means that he has heard you but not that he approves of what you say. Other Asian races have different mannerisms and they react differently from the way that we Westerners tend to react. It is important that we try to deal with them in a way which takes account of their sensitivities, their prejudices, their religious backgrounds, their cultural ideas and any other aspects. It is for these reasons that the National Thai Studies Centre is so important. I would be very disappointed if the Department of Employment, Education and Training withdraws funding from that centre. From what I have seen of that centre&mdash;and representatives of the centre have given evidence to the committee on a number of occasions&mdash;I think it is doing a remarkable job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, while there has generally been a growth in Asian languages in our schools and our universities, Thai is one of the lesser of the languages and yet it is a very important vehicle to understanding when doing deals with the Thai people. Of course, there are great opportunities for the development of relationships with Thailand and one aspect of that emerged in discussions we had with the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been one of those who have been very critical of Westpac in recent years but Gary White, the Chief Representative of Westpac in Bangkok, almost restored my faith in that bank. Westpac was one of the first banks to enter into local business dealings in Taipei and in Taiwan. In fact, Westpac had established quite a significant network. Being the first bank there, it had acquired a very good reputation. It was doing business and it was operating profitably. But blow me down if Westpac did not decide to withdraw from the Taiwan market at a time when we were trying to promote our commercial contacts, and Taiwan is a very important market for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did Westpac withdraw but it sold its business to a Belgian bank. Here we are saying that we have got continuing interests, and Westpac sells out to a Belgian bank and we allow the Europeans to come in under our neck. I felt that was totally inappropriate. Therefore, when I met Gary White, the representative of Westpac in Bangkok, I was more than a little apprehensive. However, I thought that Gary White was outstanding, as were each of the members of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce who met us that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Terry Adams of Linfox Logistics Thailand gave an excellent overview of the transport potential there. Without going into it too much, in Thailand, people unfortunately use 10-wheel trucks which are grossly inefficient. They clog the streets of Bangkok and they contribute to all of the traffic problems. There are ways by which, demonstrably, the traffic flow in Thailand, and particularly Bangkok, can and should be improved. I was quite fascinated to see a stranger making recommendations, one of which is to get rid of these 10-wheel trucks and to start introducing a reasonable means of moving goods and people around the place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that meeting of the Australian-Thai Chamber of Commerce I thought each of us learnt a great deal. I have only identified two members but there were a number of other very impressive representatives, including Will Hamilton of Thai Leighton, Alex Tan of Telstra, and Chris Leon of Thai Industrial Gases. They all brought to us a refreshing approach. I mention that morning meeting because I know the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) adverted to it. It is important that, in dealing with politics, we understand the different prejudices of those who are in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gary White, in his address, raised the issue that Senator Evans's comments had affected Australian business contacts. In no way should a government be inhibited in making comments on political issues, but, at the same time, it is very important that the Australian government takes into account the sensitivities of people in the region. This is, again, a fair stretch of the bow, but I know that, in some of the Middle East countries, some of the comments which have been made have prejudiced Australian business which is done in those communities. I am worried that the foreign minister, in making those remarks&mdash;no doubt with absolute verification of what he said&mdash;has prejudiced Australia's standing in Thailand in an unfortunate way. Perhaps if Senator Evans went along to the National Thai Studies Centre at the ANU for a little while it may give him some better understanding of how to deal with Asian people. Australia's relations with Thailand are very important to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meeting with the Australia-Thai Chamber of Commerce gave us an idea of the excellent job that Australians are doing in Thailand. There are great opportunities in Thailand, but it is unfortunate that some of the commercial contacts which came about as a result of the construction of the Friendship Bridge do not seem to have brought on the flow in construction work that we hoped for. Of course, wherever you are in Asia, or indeed wherever you are overseas, Australian companies have got to understand that they have to persist in their efforts. You cannot go for a one-week visit and think that everything is going to flow from that. You have got to be able to provide a backup service and to recognise the sensitivities of the countries concerned. Companies cannot take business for granted just because there may be a window of opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During my tabling statement I outlined the factors which the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs considered relevant to the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. I also briefly outlined a number of the committee's major recommendations, and I will now discuss some aspects of the committee's report in more detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the third paragraph of section 53 is part of the scheme of that section, it is often impossible to discuss the paragraph in isolation from the other paragraphs in section 53. The fifth paragraph of section 53 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.</PARA>
<PARA>The third paragraph of section 53 is one such exception. It provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The broad purpose of section 53 of the constitution is to preserve the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. This is the focus of a number of the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the constitution, it is the prerogative of the House of Representatives to initiate taxing and appropriation bills. This principle derives from sections 53 and 56 of the constitution. Section 53 prohibits bills which appropriate revenue or money and bills which impose taxation from being originated in the Senate. It also limits the power of the Senate to amend bills. Section 56 of the constitution gives the executive government holding the majority in the House of Representatives control in relation to the expenditure of public money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative in relation to money matters is vested in the lower House in all Commonwealth countries. This rule is regarded as a safeguard against unrestrained and politically competitive financial proposals by members of parliament who do not have the responsibility of government. However, despite this rule, all financial bills must pass both houses before being presented to the Governor-General for assent. While the House of Representatives has an exclusive right of initiation, the Senate has the power of veto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There appeared to be general agreement among participants in the inquiry that the purpose of section 53 is to preserve the financial initiative of the House of Representatives. The clerks of both houses agree with this principle. In a submission to the committee the clerk of this House, Mr Lyn Barlin, quoted <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> in stating that the financial initiative rule vests the right to initiate and the right to move to increase appropriations and taxes with the government&mdash;see page S191 of volume 1 of submissions to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, also agreed with the financial initiative rule. In a submission to the inquiry, commenting on the government's interpretation of section 53 in relation to Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994, Mr Evans noted that the purpose of section 53 is to preserve the financial initiative of the House of Representatives&mdash;see pages S65 and S219 of submissions to the inquiry. If senators also agree with this fundamental principle, the prospect of the houses drafting a compact embodying that principle may be likely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the process of examining the issues associated with the inquiry, the committee held a seminar in Canberra on 28 October last year. The participants in the seminar included Mr Dennis Rose QC, Professor Cheryl Saunders, Professor Anthony Blackshield, Dr Jim Thomson, Ms Hilary Penfold, Mr Barlin, Mr Evans and the committee's consultant, Professor Michael Coper, as well as members of the committee. One of the issues discussed at the seminar was the justiciability of section 53. This issue is important in determining the scope of the houses to negotiate a compact concerning the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional view is that section 53 is not justiciable. That is, a court cannot intervene in a legislative process if the requirements of section 53 are not being complied with. Furthermore, a law which has been passed by both houses and has received royal assent is not invalid if it does not comply with section 53. The traditional view is based on the deliberate reference to `proposed laws' in section 53 and section 54. This view is supported by the convention debates and case law. During the convention debates it was suggested that the term `proposed laws' should be used to indicate that a matter is a question of order between the two houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Osborne v. the Commonwealth (1911), 12 CLR 321, Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith commented that sections 53 and 54 deal with proposed laws&mdash;that is, bills or projects of law still under consideration and not assented to&mdash;and that they lay down rules to be observed with respect to proposed laws at that stage. Whatever obligations are imposed by those sections are directed to the houses of parliament, whose conduct of their internal affairs is not subject to review by a court of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the High Court have supported the view that section 53 is not justiciable in a range of decisions. For example, section 53 has been referred to as merely directory and for parliamentary guidance only. While most of the evidence received by the committee supports the view that section 53 is not justiciable, there are some factors which may support the alternative view, namely that section 53 may be justiciable. I will briefly outline some of these factors. The factors are dealt with in more detail in the committee's exposure draft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first factor is the declining persuasive value of relevant precedents. In Cormack v. Cope (1974), 131 CLR 432, a declaration was sought that the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill 1973 was not a proposed law by reference to which the Governor-General could dissolve both houses under section 57 of the constitution. Ultimately, a joint sitting was held, and the bill was passed by both houses, sitting together. The validity of the act was then challenged in Victoria v. the Commonwealth and Connor (1975), 134 CLR 81, which is known as the PMA case, on the ground that there had not been compliance with section 57 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to outline the judgments in each of those cases, but only to comment, in the light of discussion of those cases held during the committee's seminar on section 53. During the seminar, Professor Cheryl Saunders suggested that in Cormack v. Cope and the PMA case the court made it clear that the Australian constitution was a controlled constitution. The court showed a willingness to scrutinise the compliance of the parliamentary process with the constitution, and to intervene, at least once legislation was enacted. Professor Saunders went on to suggest that earlier High Court precedents on sections 53 and 54 might be less persuasive, following the decisions in these cases&mdash;see page 4 of the seminar transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second factor which suggests that section 53 may be justiciable is the interrelationship between section 53 and other sections of the constitution. In Osborne v. the Commonwealth, His Honour Justice Higgins queried why an act is invalid by reason of its substance under section 55 if it deals with matters other than the imposition of taxation, when a bill appropriating moneys for the ordinary annual services of the government is not invalid by reason of its substance under section 54. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comment was referred to on a number of occasions during the committee's public hearings, and lends support to the argument that section 54 should be considered justiciable. It has been suggested that there may be some lack of logic in finding the rule in section 55, but not that in section 54, justiciable. If section 54 were found to be justiciable, that could, arguably, open the door to judicial review of section 53, as well&mdash;again, see page 4 of the seminar transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third factor relevant to the possible justiciability of section 53 is the increasing emphasis on principles of responsible government. During the seminar, Professor Blackshield suggested that the justiciability of section 53 has become more of an open question, because the High Court is shifting ground, to some extent, in terms of basic constitutional theory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional model of responsible government involves judicial deference to parliament. But Professor Blackshield suggested that, when the High Court discusses representative government, it has in mind a strong conception that all arms of government have their own</PARA>
<PARA>direct responsibility to the Australian people. As part of that conception, the High Court may be more willing to insist on adherence to the constitution, even by parliament itself&mdash;see pages 10 and 11 of the seminar transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been two recent High Court cases where the justiciability of certain constitutional provisions has been at issue. The justiciability of section 54 of the constitution was raised in Northern Suburbs General Cemetery Reserve Trust v. the Commonwealth (1992-1993), 176 CLR 555, known as the Northern Suburbs case. The joint judgment referred to the traditional view that failure to comply with a procedural provision, such as section 54, is not justiciable. However, as there had been compliance with section 54, the court did not deal with whether the section was justiciable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues concerning the third paragraph of section 53 are currently before the High Court in the State of Western Australia v. the Commonwealth, the native title case. It was argued by Western Australia that three Senate amendments to the Native Title Bill contravened the third paragraph of section 53. One of the amendments concerned the insertion of a clause establishing a parliamentary joint committee on native title. Counsel for Western Australia submitted that establishing such a committee would involve a burden on the people, as it would involve various administrative costs and other expenses, revenue for which would be raised by taxation. The parliament awaits with interest any comment on the third paragraph of section 53 by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibility of comment on the issue by the High Court raises further issues. During the seminar, Professor Blackshield suggested that, even if there are justiciable issues associated with section 53, those issues may be limited. The question of whether the High Court has power or jurisdiction to pronounce on certain issues is interlocked with the question of what those issues are. Professor Blackshield went on to say that, in order to have a justiciable question before it, the High Court must be able to identify fairly precise legal questions which are capable of reasonably objective answers, and it must be able to formulate questions without venturing too far into the intramural business of parliament&mdash;see page 7 of the seminar transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, despite the factors which may support the possible justiciability of section 53, the weight of opinion and evidence to the committee suggests that the section is unlikely to be considered justiciable. The committee agrees with this body of opinion. That is a view that I hold, and I hold strongly. As it appears unlikely that section 53 will be the subject of judicial determination, it will be undesirable if there remains no authoritative pronouncement on the interpretation and application of section 53, particularly the third paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that section 53 does not impose any constraints on the parliament. As is noted in the report, disregard of these constraints may be immune from correction by the High Court. However, an interpretation that flouted section 53 would obviously be unacceptable to both houses. But if the houses did agree to a compact that was in flagrant disregard of the constitution, the High Court might then be interested in considering the matter. If the parliament is the judge of whether there has been compliance with the constitutional rules for the passage of money bills through parliament, this puts the onus on the houses to reach agreement in light of the spirit and letter of section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee's view, a compact between the houses would show parliament's fidelity to the constitutional requirements of section 53. The objective of any compact would be twofold&mdash;namely, to assist in the practical workings of the parliamentary process, and to define and limit the constitutional powers of both houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee reiterates that any interpretation should be based on a sensible and practical view of section 53 that is reasonably sustainable within the words of that section, and reasonably consistent with history and parliamentary practice. The exposure draft includes a statement of principles for possible inclusion in a compact. It is the committee's view that these principles could form a useful basis for discussion between the houses. However, the committee recognises that both houses will need to be prepared to make concessions to reach a workable agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the exposure draft and the principles contained in it promote discussion both within the parliament and beyond. I look forward to discussions on this matter with members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee and with other interested parties. Following discussions with the Senate committee I look forward to the possibility of the House reaching a formal and workable agreement on the application and interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that this matter should be treated seriously as, in my view, section 53 is almost certainly not justiciable; the onus is on the parliament to interpret that section of the constitution. Consequently, each house should take steps to ensure that it discharges its responsibility in this area. It is not good enough to look for excuses and to say that it is too hard to reach a compact and a workable agreement. I believe it can be done. I believe that it is in the interests of the parliament that it should be done, and that people should not walk away from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken my time to outline the arguments for and against justiciability because, as I said earlier, I am firmly of the view that section 53 is not justiciable and, in my opinion, that places more emphasis on the parliament to look at it and to work towards a compact. That emphasis is not on the government and the Senate, but on the House of Representatives and the Senate. That is what constitutes the parliament. And if a compact is reached, that is what will be unique about it: it will be a compact between the House of Representatives and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is achievable. To date, the process that the committee has embarked upon has shown that there is goodwill between all interested people involved; that there is a difference of opinion, but that the difference is not so marked or so stark that a workable solution is not achievable. It is achievable. I think that there are some basic principles that can be adhered to and that we can come up with a compact. That is a great step forward for the parliament. I do commend those who have been involved in the preparation of this exposure draft, and I commend that draft to the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee examined the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The processes the committee adopted were salami-like&mdash;and very appropriate&mdash;in slicing through the areas of contention and possible interpretation of that paragraph. In August last year, the committee prepared a summary of issues which outlined some of the practical measures that could be confronted by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention some of the issues raised when we first came to examine this matter. Is the difference between an amendment and a request for an amendment important in practical terms? Should the Senate refer an amendment to the House of Representatives, or a request for amendment? Are they both regarded as being the same thing? Another issue raised was whether it would be desirable for two committees&mdash;one of the Senate and one of the House&mdash;to draft a protocol detailing the procedures to be implemented when questions concerning the third paragraph of section 53 arise and establishing a mechanism for dispute resolution in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came to a conclusion. I will read recommendation No. 13, which is the final recommendation of the exposure draft. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that there should be a compact between the Houses&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Senate and the House of Representatives&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in relation to the interpretation and application of provisions of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution.

<PARA>that is, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in order to determine how negotiations in relation to the compact will proceed.</PARA>
<PARA>So right at the beginning, where we were looking at the issues, there was the concept that it might be possible for the House and the Senate to work towards an understanding. It has been called a compact. Initially, I think that might be too grand a term. If there is a memorandum of understanding, I propose that that may not cover all possible or foreseeable instances where there is a reference where we can lay down a series of protocols as each issue arises. I would need to refer to the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a period of time we will develop a firm understanding, in the form of a series of agreements, which are much stronger and more binding than sheer conventions, but are agreements gradually reached by the two Houses&mdash;an evolutionary process. It may not be possible for the two committees or for the House and the Senate to reach complete agreement on all areas that relate to section 53. But over a period, as we get particular circumstances arising, we will deal with those and add to the fund of information and the various determinations that go to constitute, finally, what could be called a contract, or a compact, an evolutionary process that may take some years to arrive at. I have no problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing to do is make a start. The last thing I would like to see is this area being thrown to the High Court for the High Court to interpret the relationship between the House and the Senate. The committee has come to a conclusion that this area is not justiciable. I think that is the right decision. There appears to be no evidence which would provide an opportunity for the High Court or any other court to become involved in the affairs relating to the charges or burdens decided by the House of Representatives and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are very fond of giving responsibilities to the parliament for us to find solutions to things but then, having given those responsibilities to the parliament, people quickly want to re-claim their rights. So the people with the responsibility have their powers to act diminished and are criticised for not being able to do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be conscious that the High Court and others, through the process of claiming their rights, are extracting from the parliament powers that they originally wanted the parliament to perform and are thereby diminishing the power and the capacity of the parliament to take action. This is one area that the High Court or any other court should never get into. It must be a matter that is settled between the two houses and the committee. The exposure draft comes to that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope this exposure draft draws a lot of comment and close examination from the community. I have dealt already with some of the practical issues that were raised in the initial stages of our inquiry, the second one being the prospect of two committees joining together and drafting a protocol. With the hindsight of nine months, that is pretty good identification of what can be the issues for the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That issues paper went on to query whether or not a court could intervene if it is considered that a proposed law does not comply with the third paragraph of section 53. Again, the issues paper proposed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What are the consequences for an Act if the requirements of the third paragraph of section 53 have not been complied with?. . . Can the Senate press a request for an amendment to a bill? . . . What are the legal consequences of the Senate introducing a charge or burden in a bill (which has already been passed by the House of Representatives) and which initially contained no proposal to place a charge or burden on the people?</PARA>
<PARA>And so, point by point, every possible ramification of the third paragraph of section 53 was dealt with at an early stage, drawing out the prospects of what the interpretations could be. Gradually, through a process of seminar and evidence, the committee reached its conclusions on each one of those areas and finally came to a conclusion that the responsibility does lie with the House and the House should accept those responsibilities; bills that impose charges should not be introduced in the Senate. We moved right away from any loosening up of what the House regards as its full responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations include that a compact be attempted but some of the other conclusions reached by the committee are as significant as that one. They include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the third paragraph of section 53 should be regarded as applicable only to bills that have originated in the House of Representatives&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and also&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, in relation to appropriations, taxes and other charges, a request should be required where an alteration to a bill is moved in the Senate which will make an increase legally possible (even if the net effect of the alteration is a decrease).</PARA>
<PARA>That is an absolutely proper interpretation, in my view, of what the third paragraph of section 53 stands for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is, in some ways, a landmark report that will only be of interest to a narrow number of people until a dispute of some sort arises. When that happens, the whole nation will want to know about the third paragraph of section 53 and why the row is between the Senate and the House and why the House is jacking up because the Senate is seeking powers that do not properly belong to the Senate. Then, I suspect, the government will get involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the recommendation of this committee that I think will ultimately be the real test of how it should go, and that is the recommendation to look at the areas of problem, draw up a compact on which should be handled and how, and leave to one side those areas where there is not going to be an agreement. Let the disputes arise and at that point, if it is necessary, reach a conclusion and the government of the day may get involved. It is not possible to foresee every instance where there will be a dispute or a problem. It is not possible to foresee every interpretation that may need to be placed on the third paragraph of section 53 but the attempt should be made and a compact written. I believe that with goodwill we can confine the area of possible conflict to something that is reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as a member of the House of Representatives, I think it would be completely inappropriate for governments to put their interpretation on what should happen. This is a matter between the houses&mdash;between the members of the House of Representatives and senators. It is what we stand for in our chamber and what they stand for in theirs that has to be settled. It is not a matter where a government or the Attorney-General's Department or anybody else can come along and say, `This is what we believe should happen.' It should be a vote that is not taken on party lines. An establishment of support for a compact of any type should be a free vote with members acting independently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the member for Banks jerk back. Today he has put his name to another landmark report which may not advance his popularity in all quarters, but which is a very important report. If we can consider it as parliamentarians, I do not believe that there are divisions of ideology on this matter. It is only how we feel as members of the House of Representatives. I cannot see the basis of an ideological difference here. The same should apply in the Senate. If we do it in that way, as professional parliamentarians, we will reach a good conclusion. If there is external interference of any sort, the prospect of our reaching that solid base of understanding will be diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment, in particular, the member for Banks and the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) for their effort, and also the staff of the committee. The report is a valuable contribution and I trust that we will have the opportunity of moving ahead with a compact at an early opportunity, perhaps not in this parliament but maybe in the next parliament. Perhaps it might be possible within this parliament to reach an early stage of an agreement between the houses. If that were the case it would be most desirable. It would be a most worthy goal for the legal and constitutional affairs committee of the House of Representatives to achieve an agreement. If we can, it will benefit not only this parliament, but the next one, and the next one, and all parliaments to come. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An inquiry into the operation of section 53, paragraph 3, is an important inquiry. It is important because it goes to the relationship between the Senate and the House of Representatives. That is why I wanted to support it and do it and be involved with it. It goes to the reasons for the formation of our constitutional relationship as a nation, dividing up the Senate and the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate was to have important power because it represented the states in a federation. Therefore it was given overwhelming power to reject legislation&mdash;even money bills&mdash;and to deny a government supply, as it has done on numerous occasions. On the other hand the Senate was not given the power to initiate money bills and to form policy for government, because it does not have the responsibility of government. Therefore the financial initiative remains with the people's house, the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primarily, this was designed to avoid the possibility of rivalry between a house that represented the states and a house that represented the people. I know the member for Banks and I share many views in this respect, perhaps unlike some of my other coalition colleagues. It was a very important distinction to make, because the Senate is becoming less and less of a states house, as it was originally designed. It was not to have the same power as a government responsible for financial and taxation decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the catalyst for the current inquiry? I will quote briefly from the report at paragraph 1.7.1. It sums up the catalyst for the inquiry and the importance of this inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the interpretation and application of the third paragraph of section 53 is a matter of fundamental substantive importance, as it preserves the financial initiative of the House of Representatives as intended by the framers of the Constitution. Proponents of this view suggest that to describe the provisions of section 53 as essentially procedural tends to downplay their importance, as they are requirements of the Constitution which must be respected.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is very true. One of the interesting things in this inquiry was the divergence of opinion between the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Clerk of the Senate. One of them was suggesting that it was a procedural matter and, by being procedural, it was no less important than if it were regarded as an important part of the constitution. I think that also demonstrates the view of the Senate with respect to procedures and form and substance&mdash;that the House of Representatives is more the house of form. Perhaps the Senate is more the house of procedure and substance and people standing up on minor points and having some victory, whereas the House sees its role very much as the defender of the rights of the people in choosing their government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specific catalyst for the current inquiry was the dispute over the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993. In that bill the Senate proposed changes to the income tax provisions that would provide deductions for expenditure incurred by life insurance companies and registered organisations in obtaining premiums which are excluded from assessable income. The view was taken that this, and another amendment dealing with taxpayers paying instalments earlier, could fall within the ambit of section 53(3) and was therefore yet another example of disagreement between the houses; and so the committee established its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broader issue was touched on at that time by the Speaker in the House when he reported that there was disagreement between the houses over this bill. That was the historic relationship between the houses, which he also wanted to be canvassed in the report; and the report does so comprehensively. One could say that a substantial part of the report deals with our historic relationship with the Senate and the place that the House of Representatives has in the Australian democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle behind section 53(3) is to ensure that the democratically elected lower house maintains its financial imperative over the democratically elected upper house that does not bear responsibility of government. I repeat that, because it is extraordinarily important to understand that in the end this report comes out very much as a House of Representatives report. One of the things I want to touch on briefly later is that the Senate committee established into this matter is more than likely to come out with a different type of compact from the one the House of Representatives has come out with. That is because we in the House of Representatives understand that the responsibility of government is overwhelming; and that while the Senate might sometimes spend 38 hours in discussion, and spend two of those hours on legislation&mdash;while senators can speak at great length, and can drag things out for years in some circumstances&mdash;in the end the responsibility for whether governments rise or fall is in the House of Representatives. That is what the people are watching on election night to see who wins the election. That is very keenly felt by my colleagues, particularly in marginal seats. Of the member for Banks, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and I, I have the most marginal seat, but I am grateful to say that I am not particularly marginal&mdash;not less than two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This principle also reflects the fact that Australia is not similar to Britain in its make-up, but is more akin to the United States. One of the historical misinterpretations of the past 100 years is that the Australian system is based on the British system of government. While we have a Westminster style government in terms of its executive and so on, when our federation was formed it was formed around the concept of a federation of states. That is nothing like Britain. Australia does not have an unaccountable upper house, because we do not have the hierarchical structure of Britain. Our system was formed around the United States system, with the federation of states electing senators to a democratically elected upper house, not an appointed one. That reflects the fact that we have a diverse population, that we are geographically enormous compared to Britain, and that in the late 1890s we were unwilling as a people to tolerate an appointed, unaccountable upper house. The principle goes back to our roots. It goes back very early in our formulation as a Commonwealth and as a country, when we tried to break from Britain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to endorse the availability test as enunciated in the report by the committee, which basically states that where money is to be made available to the executive that would otherwise not be available but for the amendments of the Senate, then that is naturally an increase in the burden on the people and falls within the ambit of section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some in the Senate and elsewhere will say that this is an extremely narrow test, that it perhaps goes too far in maintaining the financial imperative of the House of Representatives. However on balance the committee has decided, after taking evidence from vast numbers of people and hearing particularly detailed evidence from the Clerk of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, that this is the test that is most capable of application, in that it is clear and unambiguous. It does curtail the power of the Senate to amend bills that authorise expenditure. This is consistent with the principle of preserving the financial initiative of the House of Representatives and therefore I endorse it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be an area of disagreement between eminent thinkers and between the houses. I look forward to the Senate handing down its report and to seeing what it will come up with by way of a test that it will support in the application of section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House's position is a useful starting point in the compact. I also support, directly from the report, the exploration of the feasibility of a compact between the houses. Such a compact, the first of its kind between the House and the Senate&mdash;as most of the compacts so far established are between the Senate and the government&mdash;would inject greater certainty into a situation which is currently quite fluid and leads to far too many, and an increasing number of, disagreements between the Houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obvious difficulties that leap to mind with the compact. I do not think we are under any illusions about those. Firstly, as the compact is proposed by the House of Representatives, it is natural that some members of the Senate will immediately respond in a less than positive fashion. Some senators will approach it with suspicion, seeing the House as trying to reduce the flexibility of the Senate in dealing with bills. The other problem is a disagreement that currently exists between the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Clerk of the Senate. This will be probably be played out through the negotiations over a compact. The final problem will be the tardiness of previous governments, senates and houses to reach compacts with one another because of the lack of flexibility that might give in a political and constitutional sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not want to speak for long today and I have spoken for longer than I expected. In conclusion I would like to commend the report to the Main Committee and ask it to take note of the report. I would like to commend the secretariat. This has been a very long and complicated deliberation, mainly because it took such a great deal of concentration and reading and listening. The committee did not drag it out, but it took much longer than expected to produce the exposure draft and, now, the exposure draft report. We expected to finish this report by late last year and the members of the secretariat have shown great forbearance in their continued support of the committee. I would like to thank them, as they have done very good job. I would also like to thank the chairman of the committee, the member for Banks, for the excellent work that he has done. The committee has, in the last 12 months, been more active than it has been for a long time, particularly in its reference of bills. </PARA>

I commend the chairman, the honourable member for Banks, and the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), who has also made a very significant contribution in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend those who participated in the seminar, which was held in this very room. It was quite a fascinating experience. Regrettably I could not stay for all of it, but it was held on 28 October 1994 and it brought together academics, parliamentary staff and practising politicians in a way that, unfortunately, does not happen often enough. There was an opportunity to look at the way in which, in this instance, the constitution applies to the relationships between the two chambers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that a lot of people contributed to this report. In saying that, let me not omit the staff. The staff of the standing committee have done an outstanding job and Michael Wright, who has now returned to other fields in the bureaucracy, has made a particular contribution in support. He came to us from the Attorney-General's Department and was a certainly a very valuable member of staff for the preparation of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I want to say something a bit beyond that, and I do not want to repeat what others have said. The first thing is that it is very important for us all to register that, as politicians, we tend very much to get bogged down in the day-to-day consideration of those matters which are either on the blue sheet or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and are identified for our consideration for debate within our two chambers. In a bicameral system, we do not have a great deal of contact on a day-to-day basis with people in the other chamber. There are people such as the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) who have, in fact, been members of both chambers, but she is the exception. While there are a few in our House who have been members in the Senate, and a few in the Senate who have been members of the lower house, we tend to operate very much in parallel, rather than in tandem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the nature of a bicameral system, and the objectives of it, that, to my mind, emerged in perhaps a new form in looking back at the proceedings of some of those early constitutional conventions. It is quite fascinating looking back at the words of Henry Parkes and Robert Garran and some of those constitutional fathers and looking at what happens in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere to see how they developed for us a constitution which has served Australia remarkably well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There, of course, are areas of difficulty in interpretation and I will deal with the particular one we are considering shortly. But the important part about it is that, essentially, in this bicameral system of ours, the constitutional fathers set down what they saw as the best way by which an effective day-to-day operation could be achieved. That was, to give both houses, as far as possible, equal powers, equal responsibilities, with a different method of election, but giving to the House alone the responsibility, essentially, for money and financial matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining how far that peculiar responsibility for the administration of the economy lies within the House of Representatives, they set down a number of restraints. Section 53 of the constitution essentially identifies the way in which those constitutional fathers saw fit to define the difference. And it is important that we look back, as this report attempts, at the words that they used, and at why `proposed burden or charge on the people' is used. That is really the only way in which you can interpret the words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, too, that we understand that within that same constitution, they determined that matters such as section 53, relating to the administration of the powers of each chamber and the relationship between them, essentially are for the parliament itself to determine. From that, you come to the position of determining what is going to happen when the two houses have a different view on a particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) just mentioned, the origin of this reference was the most recent of those occasions when there was a difference between the two chambers. It concerned whether there should be a request or whether there could be an amendment by the Senate to a particular item of legislation. In this instance, it was the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the importance is that, if there should be an impasse between the houses, there is demonstrably a difference between the consequences of a request and those of an amendment. And as a result of an amendment and a failure to pass a bill, there are other constitutional steps that inevitably lead to a process which can generate a double dissolution, a joint sitting of the two houses, and a government's capacity to implement its will through the devices that the constitution lays down. In fact, what we are looking at is a process to ensure there will be certainty to avoid an impasse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that we are going to have confusion as to whether the Senate is or is not in the right when it wishes to refuse passage, and after 1975 I think it is important that we rely less on those reserve powers of the Governor-General. People are talking about the republic, inappropriate as I believe the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to be in doing so in Germany&mdash;in fact, I think that is something that is beyond the pale. The man does not seem to have any understanding of the responsibilities that should be his as Prime Minister. There has been a long-existing convention that you do not talk about matters pertaining to domestic politics when you are abroad and he would know of that convention. It is a pity he does not observe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am making is that in the change it becomes very important that we consider just where those reserve powers of the Governor-General, as exercised by Sir John Kerr in 1975, are going to have parameters. One of the parameters, in its way, lies in this very term of reference. What we are talking about here is an area where we are trying to remove doubt as to the powers of the Senate, and the more precision we as politicians can give to the constitution, the less those reserve powers, unwritten as they are, are going to be called on. So I think, in its way, this is a far more significant report, and the issue is far more significant, than perhaps is suggested by the narrowness of the words and the question of the definition of words and the interpretation that the courts and academics and successive clerks of the House and those who are with them have put on the sentences. I have been involved as Leader of the House on a number of occasions on matters which in fact identify some of these same problems. It is not a matter which pertains only to a Labor government. So the issues are ongoing and it is a matter which governments of both persuasions need to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there is now a report does not mean we identify to the nth degree exactly what these words mean. There is an imprecision in them. It is any proposed law, it is not any law, and any proposed charge or burden on the people. There is an historical reference. Apparently `burden on the people' is one of those rhetorical phrases that Henry Parkes used to effect. The difficulty was that he died before this particular convention was in fact implemented. Be that as it may, the words do seem to us a little archaic. They are not the ordinary phrases that you use in the back bar down at the Royal, but they are certainly phrases that do have a legal application and, in analysing the application of those words, we have attempted to come to conclusions on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the honourable member for Tangney has returned to the Main Committee. He raised in his contribution in the parliament the other day one of the other real issues which concerns me and which briefly we have addressed in this report, and that is the extent to which under the present government there has been a marked propensity to transfer financial responsibility from the House of Representatives to the Senate. My particular concern is that expenditure measures under standing appropriations are initiated in the Senate, and we have made a recommendation in respect to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the government needs to be very careful in the way in which it in fact structures its ministry and then allocates portfolios which require measures which have financial implications. I instance Senator Collins and the portfolio of primary industries and energy. His portfolio responsibility frequently requires legislation which imposes a charge or a burden on the people. As far as I am concerned, if the minister is going to be in that other chamber, that minister has to forgo the capacity to introduce legislation which can run foul of the restraints that are imposed by section 53 of the constitution. The government has not done so and, to the degree that there is a problem, I believe the government has exacerbated it by its portfolio allocation and by the degree to which legislation is introduced at this stage in the other place when it would more appropriately be introduced in the House of Representatives. For a party that purports not to believe in a bicameral system and to want to abolish the Senate, it is even more paradoxical that it allocates portfolios in a way which means that legislation is introduced into the Senate which inevitably generates the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I want briefly to identify is that there has been&mdash;both in the seminar, to which reference has been made, and in the report&mdash;some discussion about whether or not the particular provisions of paragraph 3 of section 53 are justiciable. It is because there are doubts about the extent to which it may be. Reference has been made by the honourable member for Banks, and in the report, to those areas where, it suggested, it may well be justiciable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that there is a capacity for the houses of parliament to ensure that, in fact, that question does not arise, and that is by agreeing to a compact. I do not doubt that interpretations between the two chambers may well differ, and I hope that the process that has been enunciated and the draft compact that is set out in the back of the report do give a basis on which we may be able to come to some final resolution of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend the fact&mdash;and the honourable member for Tangney referred to it the other day&mdash;that, while there has been a compact before, in this instance the compact should be between the two chambers, rather than between the government and the Senate. The chart that is set out on page 152, which provides a flow chart of the committee's recommendations, is a chart which I hope that the Senate committee responsible for this particular area will identify and consider. If it has problems, perhaps we can enter into some discussions on those and see whether we can try to overcome the whole question of the imprecision which, in its present words, section 53 produces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this report does provide a basis for a compact. The chapter 13 identification of the components of it is an excellent basis. If there are problems, they are, demonstrably, for us to resolve. Section 50 of the constitution states:</PARA>

<PARA>It is 1678 language, no doubt, but the similarity to the provisions of section 53 of our constitution is evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second broad proposition is that laws imposing taxation and laws effecting ordinary annual appropriations for government services should deal only with those subjects and, in the case of taxation laws, only with one subject of taxation. This principle protects the Senate from what is known as `tacking': the addition of extraneous matters to a bill which the Senate cannot alter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This principle also has a relatively ancient constitutional origin in a resolution of the House of Lords in 1702. That resolution, which was somewhat shorter, in effect said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The annexing of any clause or clauses to a bill of aid or supply, the matter of which is foreign to and different from the matter of the said bill of aid or supply, is unparliamentary, and tends to the destruction of constitutional government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the view of the House of Lords it tended to the destruction of constitutional government and that is a point that is worthy of repetition now. The first proposition is to be found in more detail in section 53 and the second proposition is to be found in succinct terms in sections 54 and 55 of the constitution. At the time of the convention debates, it was recognised that disputes might arise. It was agreed that when the dispute concerned parliamentary procedures such as a matter between the two houses or a matter within a house, the courts had no role in dispute resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to highlight the distinction between matters which were for parliament to determine alone and those in respect of which the High Court might have had a constitutional role, the distinction was drawn in the language of the constitution between what were called `proposed laws' and what were called `laws'. In section 53, dealing with the House's financial initiative, the expression used was `proposed laws'. Somewhat anomalously, however, a distinction was drawn in section 54 and section 55 dealing with the protection of the Senate against tacking. The expression `proposed laws' was used in respect of appropriation bills in section 54, but in section 55 the reference was to `laws' imposing taxation. The result has been that sections 53 and 54 have generally been regarded as non-justiciable. It has been for the High Court to determine whether an act imposing taxation deals with the imposition of taxation only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disputes have arisen from to time in relation to both section 53 and section 55. There were significant examples in 1993. The dispute in relation to section 55 occurred when the government introduced a bill which dealt with a range of taxing proposals including proposals to increase the rate of tax under the Fringe Benefits Tax 1986, the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1986 and the Medicare Levy Act 1986. This was plainly an attempt by the then Treasurer to deny the Senate's right to consider one subject of taxation in one bill uncomplicated by other matters, whether matters of taxation or otherwise. In the result, the government backed down and introduced a series of bills referred to by number as taxation deficit reduction bills. The Senate thereby preserved its privilege under section 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dispute that occurred in 1993 in relation to section 53 concerned the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993. The Senate sought to make amendments to income tax provisions relating to deductions for expenditure incurred by life insurance companies in obtaining premiums which were excluded from the companies' assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another proposed Senate amendment sought to require taxpayers to pay instalments of tax earlier or in higher amounts. The Senate ultimately resolved to make requests for amendment rather than seek to amend the bill; but in doing so it indicated that it did not consider the request appropriate and it was not offering a final opinion on the effect of section 53. This action was in fact a catalyst for the referral to the legal and constitutional committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate of the subject of the interpretation and application of section 53, which is the subject of the report of the House of Representatives committee under consideration now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turned out, another difference of view occurred in relation to section 53 in 1994. This concerned the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994. The Senate this time did make amendments, or purport to make amendments. On receipt of the bill from the Senate, the Speaker indicated to the House that there was doubt as to whether the Senate had the power to propose amendments rather than to request them. The House refrained from insisting on the Senate only making requests in view of the public interest&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension I was in mid-sentence, so I will go back to the start of the subject I was dealing with. I mentioned that there was another difference of view in relation to section 53 concerning the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994. The Senate this time did make amendments and the Speaker indicated to the House, when the bill came from the Senate, that there was doubt as to whether the Senate had power to propose amendments rather than to request them. The House refrained from insisting on the Senate making requests only, in view of the public interest in the particular legislation being properly passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two examples of section 53 disputes that I have referred to highlight the fact that disputes can arise frequently. They also demonstrate that the houses can, between themselves, resolve the differences by compromise. If section 53 were justiciable, that might not be possible because a court would be obliged to determine whether the requirements of the constitution had been complied with or not. That is not to say that it is to be totally excluded that a court might get involved in determination of the validity of the procedures under section 53. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a bill is non-contentious, it may not be of much practical consequence whether the Senate purports to amend the bill in breach of section 53 or whether, in compliance with the section, it requests the House to amend it. It may be otherwise if the bill is contentious. Where a request is appropriate, the Senate may determine the fate of the bill but not its form. Where the Senate has power to amend, it may determine the form but not its ultimate fate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue considered in the report is whether the Senate could resolve any section 53 issues simply by requesting amendments instead of making them. That is not, in my view, consistent with the intention of the constitution. It has to be borne in mind that the actions of the Senate may be significant for the purposes of section 57, the double dissolution provision. In the report, this issue is actually considered. It is pointed out that, where a Senate request is not complied with, the Senate bears the responsibility of determining the fate of the bill. It may drop the request or veto the whole bill. The House may accept the request, even if it is of the view that the Senate could have amended the bill. We have a precedent of that in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrary argument is that, if the Senate can amend the bill, it should not be able to request an amendment in order to retain its ability to veto the bill altogether. In that situation, it seems to me, and I think the report reflects my view, that it would be open to the House to refuse to consider the request and to return the bill to the Senate, requiring it either to amend the bill or to return the bill unamended. That course does not seem ever to have been taken. There may also be other implications in relation to section 57. If the Senate makes a request when it could amend, that may be considered a failure to pass the proposed law, thereby invoking or at least putting in train the double dissolution procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question also arose in the committee's deliberations as to whether the Senate can press a request for an amendment to a bill. Section 53 provides that the Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting amendment, and the House may make any amendment with or without modifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressing of requests is an issue which has not been formally resolved between the two houses, although there have been views expressed on the issue&mdash;and they are referred to in the report&mdash;by Sir Robert Garran, Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir John Latham. The House has never conceded the Senate's right to repeat and press or insist on a request for an amendment in a bill which it may not amend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth paragraph of section 53 permits the Senate to make a request at any stage. The view expressed by Sir Isaac Isaacs was that, once the Senate has made a request in relation to a particular issue, its power of suggestion is exhausted as far as that stage is concerned. The committee, in agreeing with that view, also agreed with the meaning attributed to `stage'; that is, it refers to recognised stages in the passage of a bill through the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect is that a subsequent request relating to a matter may not be repeated at one stage, but at a subsequent stage. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The effect of this is that although the Senate has a capacity to repeat a request for the same amendment more than once, it cannot do it more than once at the one stage in the proceeding of the bill through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another potential issue arises in relation to section 57 in that the pressing of a request by the Senate could constitute conduct on the part of the Senate constituting a failure to pass for the purposes of section 57. In his contribution to this debate, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) referred to the financial responsibility of the House. In my first contribution on the tabling of the exposure draft report in the House, I also mentioned that subject. I pointed out that it is ironic that at a time when a House committee is seeking to identify and protect the financial initiative of the House of Representatives, the House seems to be giving away any responsibility in relation to the financial scrutiny of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent 22-year period, there has been a dramatic decline in the time devoted by the House of Representatives to the main appropriation bill. An average of 60 hours was spent in each of the 10 years prior to the Hawke government being elected. In the first 10 years of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments, that average time diminished to 36 hours. The second reading debate time went down from approximately 65 per cent of the time in the first 10-year period to 47 per cent of the time in the second 10-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, the total time spent on the main appropriation bill was a mere 27 hours and some minutes. The bill was guillotined through. The committee stage at that time was guillotined in a way that, for significant departments, only six speakers could speak at an average of five minutes each. That was the sum total of the contribution of the House of Representatives to the scrutiny of the budget of those departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, the picture was similar in respect of consideration in detail. The total time spent by the House on the main appropriation bill was a mere 24 hours and some minutes and only just over a quarter of that, six hours 45 minutes, was spent on consideration in detail. When we contemplate that the budgeted revenue was $109 billion, and the budgeted outlays were $121 billion, the amount of time spent on a dollar per unit of time basis is absolutely abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I am speaking in the Main Committee, I would like to repeat a suggestion I made in an earlier speech in the House, which is that there is scope for the involvement of the Main Committee in the consideration of the budget. The budget is now considered in the budget session. It is brought down in early May and then there are, at most, about four weeks projected for budget debate before the House rises at the end of the budget session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the legislative log jam that occurs at the end of any session&mdash;and it is no different in the budget session&mdash;time is not available for detailed consideration of the budget. The experience of 1993 was depressing for speakers&mdash;I suspect it was so on the government side as well as on the opposition side. Only five minutes per department meant that the number of speakers and the range of their subjects in the 1994 budget detailed consideration was even less than in 1993. It is a matter that I commend to Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins and to the Procedure Committee for future consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to see some means whereby an estimates procedure is introduced in the House so that the House, which has constitutional responsibility for financial initiatives in the parliament, exercises its responsibility instead of abdicating it in favour of the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr Baldwin</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The 1994 annual review of Family Payment entitlement involved issuing review forms to over 640,000 families about income and assets; review forms to around 210,000 families with students aged 16 and over; and collecting information on net rental property losses, to establish whether families had an ongoing entitlement to Family Payment in 1995. Some of these were not processed for the first payday in January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Some families did not send the form back by the due date (and had been advised that payment would stop after the last payday on 22 December 1994 if they did not); or they did not provide enough information to enable the Department of Social Security (DSS) to properly assess their claim (in which case departmental officers contacted them to get the information but without success). In some other cases DSS received the form but action was not finalised due to the volume of processing at that time. It is not possible to distinguish exactly the number of cases which fall into each category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) As at 5 January 1995, there were 41,926 cases where payment was not made because forms had not been processed to completion for the reasons outlined in (a) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Every effort was made to complete processing of forms which had been returned to DSS by the end of the week beginning 16 January 1995. At 3 February 1995 there were around 6,000 cases where payment had not been made because the form had been returned late or insufficient information had been provided to allow payment without further response from the client. Families who return the review form before 31 March 1995 and who are eligible for payment from the beginning of 1995 will receive full arrears of Family Payment from the first payday in January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) DSS cannot continue to pay families irrespective of the outcome of the review because this would lead to overpayments, a number of which may not be recovered. Of the outstanding claims finalised after 23 December 1994, around 16,000 families were found to be ineligible for Family Payment by 17 February 1995. In addition, around 42,000 families had still not returned their review form by 17 February 1995.</PARA>
