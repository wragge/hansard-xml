<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 November Senator Crichton-Browne stated in the Senate in relation to me:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps he should have applied for New South Wales police where he would have fitted in very well.</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever Senator Crichton-Browne meant by this is unclear. However, if in any way he was attempting to impugn my reputation as a former police officer, he ought to be mindful that one of my referees during the recent preselection to the seat of Moore was the current Deputy Commissioner of the WA Police. He actually did agree to be a referee in my case, which is in stark contrast to Senator Crichton-Browne where his so-called referees made public statements that they had not been asked to be his referees and if asked would have refused. I might point out that the Deputy Commissioner was appointed by the Court government cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crichton-Browne went on to say in relation to me `he scrutineered the results of one of his own branches' as if there were something wrong with that. The election was for branch officers and delegates for the Joondalup branch. I was appointed by the meeting along with Paul Stevenage, a preselection rival. The chairman of the meeting was none other than David Honey, the state president and former ally of Senator Crichton-Browne. Senator Crichton-Browne's accusation that somehow being a scrutineer&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was provided with the results by the returning officer and asked to pass them on to the divisional secretary. But in the process, he had them typed up in his own office and changed the result to one which materially benefited him and benefited his prospects of preselection.</PARA>
<PARA>That is untrue, as he well knows, and has been established by his former party's own state executive. Ironically, the matter revolved around a complaint that three people who stood for office and participated in an annual general meeting in another branch on 16 August 1994 suddenly appeared as participants in the other branch on 22 August. </PARA>

The person who made the statutory declaration was Julie Debnam, a close friend of Wayde Smith and Wayne Bradshaw, who was most recently seen on television tearfully hugging Senator Crichton-Browne outside the state executive meeting when they decided to expel him from the party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Telecommunications interception is an intrusive act. It is not as intrusive as other surveillance methods, such as personal surveillance and questioning of members of the public, but it is nevertheless a major infringement of a person's privacy. This government is very concerned to ensure that the balance between privacy and law enforcement and national security needs is an appropriate one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also concerned that interception be a cost-effective investigative tool. Because of the complexity of and changes in telecommunications technology, the capacity to intercept has become more and more expensive. The government wanted to find a balance between the needs of law enforcement and security agencies, individual rights and the cost to the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, in July 1993 the government asked Mr Pat Barrett, a deputy secretary in the Department of Finance, to conduct a review of the long-term cost effectiveness of telecommunications interception. His terms of reference required him to evaluate the long-term cost effectiveness of maintaining Australia's current telecommunications interception capability in the light of rapid changes in complex telecommunications technology, the introduction of new telecommunications services and the continuing need to safeguard individual privacy. Mr Barrett reported in March 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence suggests that telecommunications interception is very effective as part of an integrated framework of surveillance by both law enforcement and security agencies. Up to now it has been a highly cost-effective investigative technique, particularly in a complementary role to other methodologies. Mr Barrett concluded that, in the short to medium term, the effectiveness of our law enforcement and security agencies and Australia's international credibility in these areas will continue to be dependent on telecommunications interception. In the longer term, the situation will depend very much on international developments. The government accepts that Australia should continue to support efforts to develop international user requirements. Mr Barrett made recommendations aimed at achieving a continuing cost-effective interception capability, which are being implemented by this bill or administratively, as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the long-term cost effectiveness of telecommunications, Mr Barrett has recommended a further review in 1997, after full deregulation of the telecommunications market. The government has accepted that recommendation. A review in 1997 will be able to evaluate the outcomes of Mr Barrett's review as well as assessing the prospects for maintaining interception capabilities against the background of further deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Barrett concluded that `the significant and demonstrable justification' required for such a major intrusion on an individual's privacy as interception of telecommunications is well demonstrated by the extensive range of successful prosecutions and convictions based largely on evidence obtained by interception. He was satisfied that the administrative processes of both the law enforcement and security agencies and the carriers meet the requirements of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. He also concluded that the current system is reasonably effective in recognising and protecting the rights of all parties. He did, however, make recommendations which would contribute to greater transparency and discipline through fuller reporting and enhanced inspection processes. The government is implementing the majority of those recommendations in the current bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a new special register with details of warrants which do not lead, directly or indirectly, to a prosecution. The amendments also create a new civil right of action against a person who unlawfully intercepts or publishes a telephone communication. These, together with the new prohibition on the disclosure of designated warrant information, represent major new privacy protections, adding to the already stringent controls in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, agencies will be required to provide more detailed information, to be included in the annual reports to the parliament under the act, about the usefulness and the effectiveness of warrants, including use of information obtained under a warrant in criminal proceedings and cost effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offences which may found an interception warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act will be extended to include those more serious offences involving corruption, including police corruption, or organised crime which are not at present covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Barrett also made other recommendations which are to be implemented administratively, such as monitoring of international developments in encryption, more frequent inspection of agency records in secure premises and an increased role for Austel in the coordination of interception matters. A recommendation concerning warrants for the supply of `call data', that is, electronically generated information about telephone traffic falling outside the current scope of the act, is the subject of discussions with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did not accept two of Mr Barrett's recommendations. The inspection and reporting function of the ombudsman under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act will not be transferred to the Privacy Commissioner. The present arrangements work well, are well understood by agencies and are in line with those applicable in the states. The inspection function is one which is directed towards compliance rather than adjudication of privacy issues. It is therefore better suited to the ombudsman's functional responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also did not accept the necessity to notify any innocent person whose telephone service has been intercepted of the fact of the interception. The new special register will provide a similar level of protection against misuse without the adverse consequences of possible disclosure of sensitive operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to tighten up the exception to the prohibition on interception by a carrier employee in the course of his or her duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January this year the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) asked the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to review the act to determine whether amendments were necessary to limit the breadth of the exemption given to carrier employees to intercept telecommunications in the course of their duties in maintaining the telecommunications network. This was in response to certain allegations by a group of persons known as the `Casualties of Telecom' about monitoring and recording of customer telephone services. The review of the exemption, conducted by the Attorney-General's Department, concluded that the exception is very broad and that there are good grounds for narrowing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment is only one element of a combination of measures which will address the problems that have arisen in the area of customer privacy in telecommunications. The development of more effective policies and procedures by the carriers, in consultation with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, will support the proposed changes. These policies and procedures will serve to protect consumer privacy and will provide employees with guidance as to the circumstances where monitoring of services can take place, and the procedures that are to govern those activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining whether an interception was reasonably necessary, a court is to have regard to matters which are specified in regulations. Such matters may include matters contained in guidelines or similar directions issued internally by a carrier or by an independent body such as Austel or the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments have no direct financial impact. In the past the Commonwealth has borne the cost of providing an interception capability. The Telecommunications Act amendments will require telecommunications carriers to pay the initial cost of developing interception capabilities in new telecommunications services and recover those costs from Commonwealth and state user agencies. This cost recovery will be as negotiated between intercepting agencies and the carriers but will be on a fair commercial basis. Actual spending proposals will be subject to the approval of the Attorney-General, the Minister for Communications and the Arts and the Minister for Finance. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for the second reading speech. I was particularly interested in the speech and its terms because the minister has delivered the speech for another minister of this chamber. The comments that I intend to make are not critical of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs but are critical of those who are not present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that this bill is prepared under the authority of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), both of whom are ministers of this chamber. The bill was first debated in the Senate and the second reading speech that was given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs today on behalf of his colleagues was exactly the same speech as was delivered in the Senate&mdash;the speech delivered almost 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal has happened in the meantime and I must say that I find it quite extraordinary that on a bill about which there has been considerable deliberation and discussion of the content, and a report from a Senate committee, those matters have not been adverted to. Nor has the government given any indication as to the way in which the bill has progressed. I think it shows the way in which this government sees this chamber very much as a rubber stamp in the legislative process. It diminishes the parliament when this chamber is treated in this way. If the minister has advisers present, they may take on board those comments. It reflects on the way in which advisers prepare these matters and on the government's approach that they are prepared to address a bill of this type in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecommunications interception has been a matter of concern to this parliament. The Speaker chaired a committee of this parliament on which I, the Minister for Communications and the Arts and a number of other members of this parliament served. It is not a matter on which it ought to be taken for granted that this chamber is without interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly disappointed at the way in which this legislation has been dealt with. It is not because the opposition has any particular objections to the bill in the form that it has now been presented that I make those comments, because were it not for the opposition pressing the government to give priority to this bill it probably would not have even been dealt with today. I have given leave for this debate to proceed even though the bill has only just been introduced to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is to give effect to a number of recommendations in a report to the government by Mr Barrett, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Finance. He was asked to conduct a review of the long-term cost effectiveness of telecommunications interception. He reported in March 1994 with the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the long term cost effectiveness of telecommunications interception</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with seven subject areas. The first is to extend the categories of offences for which interception warrants may be sought. This has been done to include offences involving corruption, including police corruption and organised crime. Secondly, it requires the establishment of a new special register with details of warrants that do not lead directly or indirectly to a prosecution. Thirdly, it creates new civil remedies for unlawful interceptions or unlawful communication of information derived from an interception. Fourthly, it prohibits the disclosure of information about the existence of or details of a warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, it provides for improvement in the quality of reports by requiring the following additional information: information about the number of arrests made or likely to be made on the basis of intercepted information and an assessment of the usefulness of intercepted information; details on the proportion of warrants in force which yielded interception information leading to a prosecution or used in support of a prosecution; and information about the average cost of warrants issued. Sixthly, it further restricts by adding a requirement of reasonable necessity to the authority of employees of carriers to monitor or record telephone conversations for the purposes of installing and maintaining the telecommunications network or for tracing nuisance callers. Seventhly, it makes communications carriers responsible for the cost of developing interception capabilities on existing or new telecommunications services with the licence holders being able to recover these costs from user agencies over time on terms and conditions agreed between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, pursuant to the Selection of Bills Committee report, this bill was seen as sufficiently important to be referred for examination to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, and the majority of that committee recommended that the bill as introduced be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply note that there was a good deal of interest in this matter. The Senate committee was chaired by Senator Cooney, with Senator Spindler as the deputy chair and comprised Senators Ellison, Chris Evans, McKiernan and O'Chee. But a large number of members came as participatory members: Senators Abetz, Boswell, Chamarette, Kemp, Margetts, Tambling, Knowles, Baume, Brownhill, Harradine, McGauran, Short and Vanstone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see that it was not a matter that was addressed without a considerable degree of participation. The committee received a large number of submissions from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Attorney-General's Department, the Criminal Justice Commission, the Telecommunications Authority, the South Australian Police, the Department of Finance, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the Law Society of New South Wales, the Northern Territory Police, Telecom Australia, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services and the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman. They had a number of reports that were not released. They also heard from the South Australian Police; the Independent Commission Against Corruption; the South Australian police again, in the form of Detective Superintendent Barry England; the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia; a supplementary submission from the Attorney-General's Department when Mr Barrett appeared; and the Privacy Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the evidence that was taken in public hearings, we see that there was quite a representative group: the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Department of Finance with Mr Barrett, the Australian Federal Police, Telecom and Telstra, the CEPU, Optus, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Casualties of Telecom, the National Crime Authority, the New South Wales Crime Commission, the Victorian Police Department, Austel, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and particularly its Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, and the Australian Federal Police. The committee later had a number of additional meetings with the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report details a number of those concerns but, given that the balancing in this area is often with issues relating to privacy and how you balance those issues up with the public interest of proceeding to intercept telephone calls&mdash;it is a very intrusive process, one which is often without notice&mdash;it was important that the parliament, in this case in the Senate, gave all those who were interested in this matter&mdash;particularly the report, its conclusions and this related legislation&mdash;the opportunity to put their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee concluded, and I think they quoted from the evidence of Mr Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, when he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is, I think, a careful attempt to bring an increased level of discipline into various aspects of the process that surrounds the obtaining of telecommunications interception warrants and, obviously, I welcome the elements of the bill that seek to incorporate greater scrutiny into the process of the effectiveness of warrants, in particular, and the cost of warrants. The reference in the bill to a civil remedy is not unimportant and is a significant new acknowledgment of the importance of the parliament protecting individual privacy interests through more accessible mechanisms than had previously existed.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee further stated that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">...agrees with these sentiments and is satisfied that the measures contained in the Bill are necessary and should be enacted into law.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus the committee recommended the bill as introduced be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there was a dissenting report from the Deputy Chairman, Senator Spindler. He noted that the bill had attracted criticisms, and I point them out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecom, Optus and the CEPU voiced concerns that carriers and their employees would be exposed to unreasonable legal risk. Telecom claimed that acts done in good faith for maintenance or operational purposes, in accordance with guidelines referred to in the regulations, could nevertheless be found by a court not to be reasonably necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The uncertainties created by the legislation were made worse by the fact that the regulations have not been made public, making it difficult to assess the impact of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Casualties of Telecom called for the involvement of AUSTEL in giving approval for voice monitoring and recording, to bring independent expertise to bear in deciding whether such monitoring and recording was necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Privacy Commissioner called for examination of a requirement of customer consent for all voice recording.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Spindler therefore was of the view that the bill should not be proceeded with until proposed regulations were available, and I think he also sought certain amendments. He was dissenting from a majority report which involved members of the government and members of the opposition agreeing that the bill should proceed as introduced. Senator Spindler's amendments dealing with authority of employees of carriers to intercept communications were based on a concern that they were not satisfactory as regulations were not known at the time. The Democrats would not deal with the bill until they had seen those regulations. They therefore caused quite a degree of delay to the proceeding of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not the coalition that in any way delayed the process of this bill. However, the government knew it had our support. It could have, if it had wished, proceeded to deal with this matter earlier. The reason we are concerned that there has been a delay in dealing with this matter is that the earlier passage of this bill could have been of advantage to the New South Wales royal commission into the New South Wales Police Force, particularly in revealing evidence in police corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members may have observed that a great deal of the surveillance activity that has adduced evidence of police corruption in New South Wales arose through conversations that were not by means of telecommunications interception but rather by the use of tape recordings of conversations of individuals. In that sense, it may well have been a significant advantage to that commission and its work if this legislation had been proceeded with more promptly and if the government had been prepared to respond more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter in which, even in relation to the regulations that Senator Spindler was seeking, the government could have been in a position to process those matters expeditiously and proceed with this legislation. The opposition is not opposed to the legislation. We have facilitated its passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply note that with both ministers responsible for this legislation being in this chamber&mdash;given the amount of time that the Senate took to undertake its inquiry and the impact that may have had on other legislation being dealt with by the Senate&mdash;it is certainly disappointing to me that, given the longstanding interest of members of the House of Representatives, from the Speaker down, on the issue of telecommunications interception, the inquiries that could have been undertaken in this case were not undertaken by a committee of this chamber. Again it is a matter of process. But it is the government's way of dealing with these matters which indicates that it takes this chamber for granted. It is a reflection of the way the parliament is diminished by the way in which the executive deals with these important questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 29th report of the committee for 1995, incorporating a dissenting report, relating to the York Park North office construction, Barton, ACT; redevelopment of Hinkler site, Barton, ACT; and redevelopment of Woolshed site, Barton, ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report that I have just tabled concerns the proposed construction by Australian Estate Management of three office blocks in the Canberra suburb of Barton at a cost of $118.109 million. The committee has recommended that the redevelopment of the Hinkler Building site to provide a new headquarters for the Australian Federal Police should proceed at a cost of $39.158 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also recommended that alternative options for the location of the Department of Industrial Relations, including Civic, be examined. Details of this examination should be provided to the committee for further consideration. In relation to the proposed development of the York Park North site, the committee has recommended that an office complex for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories be developed at either the Tuggeranong or Gungahlin town centres. Details of the preferred site and proposed design should be provided to the committee for further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For the committee this was one of the most difficult inquiries of the year, made even more difficult by the amount of interest it generated in the ACT and the amount of lobbying that all members of the committee were subjected to. The original proposal was for three office blocks to be located within the Barton area of the ACT. The committee has rejected two of these proposals for a number of reasons&mdash;the appropriateness of office buildings in this area and the difficulties concerning the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One strong argument put to the committee was that moving a large number of public servants from Civic would result in Civic being devastated. The committee does not accept this view, especially considering that 10 years ago the fear was that Civic would be overpopulated, and under pressure the government decided that, once public servants moved out, their place would not be taken by other public servants. This is now regarded as the `conventional wisdom' in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in response to a question from the committee, we were advised by the National Capital Planning Authority that backfilling of vacated offices is permitted. The committee emphasises that there is no ban on public servants backfilling vacated office accommodation in Civic. However, the committee is concerned at the combined impact that these three projects would have on Civic, while not sharing the rather alarmist views expressed by some witnesses&mdash;especially developers, seven of whom appeared before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say it was for me a delight to learn of the concern that major entrepreneurs have for youth unemployment. Most of the seven developers who appeared before the committee made much of this and indicated that the committee should take this into consideration in our deliberations. I have never seen developers having such a social conscience before but, then again, perhaps developers in Canberra are different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal of the Department of Industrial Relations on what is known as the Woolshed site has been rejected by the committee. The committee believes that better use could be made of this land and that the proposed car park structure would be inappropriate and not in keeping with the national significance of the Barton area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is of the view that the proposal should not proceed on the Woolshed site and that Australian Estate Management should seek another site, preferably in Civic, to house the Department of Industrial Relations. A Civic location would partially meet the objections to the loss of personnel from Civic outlined by many groups, including the ACT government. The committee expects to be fully briefed on the new proposal for the Department of Industrial Relations. The committee considers that the Australian Federal Police has put the most persuasive case for a Barton location. The committee therefore believes that the AFP proposal should proceed as planned on the Hinkler site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee members have been bombarded with claims and counterclaims regarding rent. The Australian Federal Police are currently located in four different premises. The building in Civic is unsuitable and does not meet occupational health and safety requirements. It is not suitable for the Federal Police requirements and, regardless of what rent is charged, the simple fact is that the building is too small to accommodate current Federal Police needs. For operational reasons, the majority of the committee believes it is better to have the Federal Police located in their own building in Barton. However, in coming to this conclusion the committee regards it as regrettable that it will be necessary to demolish the George Knowles building which was refurbished in 1992 at a cost of some $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third proposal concerns a new office building for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. The committee does not see the need for this building to be in Barton and recommends that this building be placed in either Tuggeranong or Gungahlin with an emphasis on Tuggeranong. The committee is conscious of the need for dispersed work opportunities in Canberra and is also concerned at parking limitations and traffic pressure in Barton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was surprised at the evident lack of coordination between the National Capital Planning Authority and the ACT Planning Authority which was displayed in these projects. This was particularly so in the delay in obtaining approval for the amendment to the National Capital Plan to allow the Department of Industrial Relations proposal to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed that in this the final report of the year, the 29th report, opposition members have decided to put in a dissenting report. While respecting their right to do so, I must say that the last time there was a dissenting report was in the lead-up to the last election. So in what some regard as a lead-up to the next election I was not greatly surprised that, although for three years the committee had acted in a bipartisan way, party politics should intrude in this last report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the proposition that these proposals should be deferred. We are a committee of the 37th parliament and will report to the 37th parliament. There has been a claim that these proposals were presented with undue haste, but let me assure the House that, regardless of the time span between referral and hearing, these proposals received more detailed examination than perhaps any other during the past three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had meetings with the Master Builders Association of the ACT, Lend Lease and various lobbyists. The initial hearing with Australian Estate Management was on 10 November 1995. Everyone&mdash;and I stress this point&mdash;then had a week in which to study the evidence presented by the Australian Estate Management and the question and answer session before the next hearing, which was on Friday, 17 November, when a series of witnesses appeared before the committee. In fact, that day the committee sat from 8.30 in the morning to 7.30 in the evening. I personally attended all briefings, hearings, inspections and, as indicated, many people beat a path to my door to lobby me. I also had discussions, both formal and informal, with all the local federal members and discussed the matter with members of the ACT government at the Public Works Committee conference in Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not the undue haste but the consistent lobbying that we were all subjected to that raised doubts about the project. Some felt the government had a duty to let entrepreneurs make money. I reject that as the sole role of governments. The truth was not always told in these extensive lobbying sessions and there were some fairly wild claims made. The lobbying continued right up until yesterday. Even then, I received yet another three-page fax offering various rents for the Federal Police in Civic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those pushing the cheap rent in Civic option are not saying is that, when Australian Estate Management commenced renegotiating rents for various properties in Civic two or three years ago, the entrepreneurs now making much of why cheap rents are so important in Civic at that time were asking for rents as high as the rent being charged for the Bond building in Sydney, the most expensive building in Sydney. That is the rent they were asking two or three years ago in Civic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the entrepreneurs want a competitive closed market in Civic. Had they not been so greedy on the rents proposed a couple of years back, maybe these proposals would not have come to my committee. But why should departments put themselves at the whim of entrepreneurs who, when they again have a captive market, would again push up the rents? The bottom line must surely be that not only is it government policy to have their own buildings but also, from a long-term point of view, it is much cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seven different development companies came before the committee all basically arguing that departments should be located in Civic in buildings either owned or proposed to be built by them. I do not believe that the role of the federal government is to fill buildings built on speculation by entrepreneurs with Canberra public servants, and it surprises me that the opposition members of the committee should support this view which, in the long-term, is much more expensive than having their own purpose-built building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought, obviously wrongly, in this report which involved considerable compromise on all sides that the committee had reached the most suitable alternative. We have basically recommended one building for Civic, thus dealing with the entrepreneurs and the ACT government concerns about Civic. We have recommended one building for Barton and we have recommended one building for Tuggeranong or Gungahlin, again meeting the request of the ACT government and many local groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that this report has now become subject to a political argument. But it does show the influence of the Canberra entrepreneurs on the Liberal Party. Senator Reid in the other place yesterday, when the Senate took note of the paper, talked about the enormous numbers being put into Barton. One would think the committee had recommended the whole three projects go there instead of one building housing 628 personnel. I must stress that this building replaces a building already on that site. What the committee did was, I believe, act in a responsible manner, especially for the long-term planning of Canberra. I must stress that we took note of all the submissions, not just those of the developers. We came up with what I believe, given the inherent difficulties, was a workable compromise that should have satisfied everyone and addressed the concerns raised by many to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I absolutely reject the suggestion made by Senator Reid that the committee has not adequately considered this proposal. I personally&mdash;and I know other members did&mdash;spent hours in meetings and discussions on this proposal. In the weeks when the House was not sitting I drove to Canberra on several occasions for meetings. I have always been available for any discussions. I absolutely reject Senator Reid's suggestion about how this report could come before the House so quickly. `It is an absolute mystery,' she claimed. Let me solve this absolute mystery for her. When you spend, as a committee member, hour after hour after hour on a project discussing all aspects and have your committee staff work until midnight on at least two occasions writing the report, the mystery is solved: it is called dedication and it is no mystery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strength of the opposition's position on this project is testament, I believe, to the power of the lobby group in Canberra and I suppose their links with the Liberal Party. I also absolutely reject the suggestion by Senator Reid that I, or committee members, have been put under pressure by ministers. I neither was approached by nor spoke with any minister about this proposal. It is true that on Wednesday last week one minister telephoned my office several times but I refused to speak to him. I had made up my mind as to what I was going to recommend to the committee. Quite frankly, I was sick and tired of being lobbied. The only people putting pressure on me, and I suspect on the other committee members, were the lobbyists in Canberra. The ALP members of the committee rejected their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, I was aware of the amount of interest these projects were generating in the ACT&mdash;one could hardly be unaware of it. I did discuss the project with several bureaucrats and asked them various questions about what would happen if various proposals were made. I stress again that no minister actually spoke to me about these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very conscious of the strong feelings on all sides regarding this proposal, and of the amount of lobbying that was going on, so I personally gave a lot of time to this proposal. I wanted to be convinced in my own mind that I had carefully considered all the options before bringing it before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is this: whatever happens to this proposal, whatever happens to the Barton site, in two years time the Federal Police will still move out of their current accommodation. It is not large enough for them. It does not meet occupational health and safety requirements. In short, it is unsuitable. The landlords could drop the rent to a quarter of what it is today but the building would still be unsuitable and the Federal Police, in one way or another, in two years time will be moving out of there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members have to ask themselves why the opposition members are so determined that the three proposals go to Civic. The answer is that there is one hell of a lot of money involved in this project. A lot of developers stand to make a lot of money, and that is why my committee was subjected to an unbelievable amount of pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the committee's proposal is rejected&mdash;and I believe this is why a motion was moved in the Senate in relation to the work of the Public Works Committee&mdash;I hope that when every member of the Australian Federal Police who now occupies unsatisfactory and unhealthy office space in Civic, a building that Senator Reid seems to regard as some sort of architectural gem or workers' paradise, comes to cast their vote in the forthcoming federal election they will know which party insisted they stay in that unsuitable building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the Senate, Senator Reid said that if the AFP building were left vacant it `would be a matter of concern for the landlords'. I suppose it would be a matter of concern for the landlords, but I thought that was what happened in a free enterprise competitive system. We are always being told how we are going to have more free enterprise and be more competitive. Some people get burnt in these systems. If that particular building, which is unsuitable for its current use, is vacant, the landlords will have to spend some money to make it suitable. Then, in a competitive market, they might be able to let it to someone else, but they will not be letting it to the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid was very selective in her quotes from our report. There can be disagreement, and I accept this, with our proposal, but I find it deeply offensive that after chairing this committee for eight years and investigating and reporting on hundreds of projects worth billions of dollars my integrity should be questioned regarding a couple of office blocks in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The projects that we have recommended this morning, totalling $118 million, bring the amount the committee has recommended this year to $1.5 billion. This is the 29th report, but in fact as it covers three projects it should really be the 31st report that the Public Works Committee has tabled this year. This has been a record year for us in the number of reports we have covered, the expenditure involved and the amount of work that has been imposed on the committee members and secretarial staff. It has been a phenomenal workload. As other members of parliament relax over the Christmas break, we still have four more hearings and inspections scheduled. So there is no rest for the Public Works Committee over Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the dissenting report&mdash;and I do stress there was only one&mdash;I want to thank all the committee members for the support they have given me throughout the year. I pay particular tribute to the staff, especially the three senior members: Peter Roberts, who is the Secretary, Mike Fetter and Denise Denehy. The demands that have been put upon them, especially in the last month&mdash;and two nights this week they worked past midnight so we could hand down the report&mdash;have been phenomenal. But, as always, they have responded magnificently. Were it not for their dedication to the work of the committee, we would not have been able to give approval to projects worth in excess of $1.5 billion this year. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As one of the members of the committee who put in a dissenting report, and having listened to the chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), could I say that all the members are aware of the work the chairman does. The reflection that might be within the dissenting report is not directed at the chairman. What he has just said indicates that on this particular issue there was considerable pressure, more so on him than on the rest of us. I believe the unnecessary pressure was because of the rushed judgment by three departments who knew what they were doing two years ago but put the final proposition before us in the last three months of this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The analogy the chairman drew with another report on which there was dissent was symbolic of what must have happened then. I was not on the committee then, but the DFAT building down there now stands as testimony to the rush and bustle that accompanied that report&mdash;the same rush and bustle that accompanied this report. I do believe, in spite of what the chairman has said, that there was a rush, which was borne out by the fact that the staff has been working flat out for the last fortnight and more particularly over this week to get it finished in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what pressures the chairman might have been under from his own side of parliament&mdash;that is, the government; I would imagine they were considerable&mdash;but I do believe we are in this position because, as he said, these should be the 29th, 30th and 31st reports. None of these matters should have been referred together; they should have been referred separately. The committee should have been given the advantage of being able to sit and consider each proposition on its merits. I am not saying that the decision itself is not of merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are spending $118 million at the close of this the 37th parliament. It was the duty of the committee to determine whether that was a proper expenditure in the circumstances. I am aware of the negotiations on rental that have been going on for the last two years. I am also aware that Kippax Development Pty Ltd sent us a letter yesterday suggesting there were more rental considerations to be had. At this moment I am not convinced that a rental proposition alternative that might be available is a better proposition than the $118 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three departments are making a rush on this so that they will be in Barton and near the parliament. This could well be the last time bureaucratic pressure is used so a department can get into a select area. The planning advice that was given to us in the course of this project suggests those departments should not be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a dissident report. The fourth recommendation made by the government members relates to two of the departments. There has to be a reference back to the committee in any case. These matters cannot be referred back to us in the life of this parliament. So we are asking for the deferral of two of these submissions, and the government members suggest that there should be a deferral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter that comes into play concerns the Australian Federal Police. Again, my complaint is not only about whether a rental situation can now be accommodated but also about the lack of planning whereby the Federal Police were put into the present building five or six years ago and are now asking for a separate building. Perhaps the department might ask why five or six years ago this proposition was not put to the government. That is a fair argument. There has been an abysmal lack of planning in that respect. They are now knocking down the George Knowles building, where only two or three years ago we spent $2 million in Commonwealth funds providing for its refurbishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman has already indicated that there has been a tremendous rush of work. I associated myself with one limb of it. I was not able to get to the first hearing. I came to the second hearing because I understood that there would be a lack of members on that committee to hear that evidence through. As a member of the committee, I believe that there are some questions yet to be asked and answered in this connection. The documents should have been submitted earlier and separately. There would then have been a better opportunity to flush out the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman will not agree with me, but every time I look and see that DFAT building I think of a building that is not compatible with the surrounds of this place. I think of how we might have been incorporating three other buildings. By the chairman's own admission, the car park there is badly constructed. It is the worst architecturally designed building that has ever been put before the committee. Again, the committee rushed judgment on these matters. We could do quite well by looking to see what the planning authority does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Capital Planning Authority disappointed me. They told us that they cannot directly tell a client what they can do but they can say what the client cannot do. They play a passive role. We have 74 people within that department planning in a passive role what you cannot do, not what you can do. If that is what the planning authority does, yet what is going to go into Barton and the parliamentary triangle has not been properly planned, somebody is doing a job for nothing. I am not suggesting that we wait for a report for the next three or four years while these parties come together to create a plan. We must have a plan for that area. DFAT stands as an example of why we should have that plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed with the evidence of the Master Builders Association. They told us about the means by which AEM and other instrumentalities in this area go about putting out lump sum contracts and things like that. There are a lot of barbs in this area. I was grateful to be able to hear that evidence. Security guarantees and payment guarantees keep small contractors out of the action involving this $118 million. Small subcontractors can inhibit them from participating because they do not have the funds to put up for the security guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also warned about the lump sum concept. I did not really appreciate the difficulties with it. Neither does AEM. When it comes to the best value, one has to wonder whether project management or a lump sum is the best for the Commonwealth. Certainly down the line we have to accommodate those people who will put up these structures. I believe that we are assenting to many of the chairman's propositions. The only one that we dissent from is why, in this rush to judgment on the death of this 37th parliament, the 38th parliament does not have an opportunity to consider these matters in more leisure and detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I appreciate the work that the chairman has put into this. Obviously, he has been subject to more lobbying. I inform him that I am not part of the Liberal Party establishment of Canberra or anywhere else in Australia. I believe that I bring to this an independent view about what might have transpired in other areas. The committee has to look at the manner in which the work is programmed and how those propositions are put to us. The departments have to understand that, if they are going to get a proper review and a proper and unanimous report, they have to be prepared to come earlier and give more details than they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be my last opportunity to speak as a member of the committee. I want to say again what a great delight it has been working with it. It is the most productive and rewarding committee we have in this place. I cannot speak enough of the dedication of the staff and what they have to put up with not from me but from other members of the committee who will remain unnamed. They are a dedicated staff. I believe that the strength of the committee is not only in its chairmanship and members but more in the dedication of its staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the dissident report. These proposals were presented to the committee by AEM with undue haste. There is the absence of any long-term planning in the parliamentary triangle and Barton. I believe that that is obvious and that mistakes have already been made. The pending election may alter the priorities of the government of the 38th parliament. I am not predicting which party will be in government. Two of these proposals will be referred back to the committee in the 38th parliament. That is why we have made the suggestion that we have. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was under strong pressure, as have been the local members. They have come up with a very reasonable and well thought through compromise. As the honourable member said, this has resulted in a more detailed examination than any other inquiry that the committee has done in this parliament. I congratulate him for his leadership in coming to a conclusion that seems so eminently reasonable. It is reasonable because it reaffirms the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Capital Plan is built around the principle of the dispersal of employment opportunities around the town whereby there should be employment opportunities in each of the town centres. This compromise allows that to happen; it maintains that. That principle is built on an absolutely sound and pragmatic evaluation of the best ways to reduce costs in the construction and planning of Canberra. In 1984, the Metropolitan and Canberra Policy Plan concluded that this dispersed pattern of employment would confer a number of benefits on the town and the nation. They were reiterated by the National Capital Development Commission in a submission to the joint parliamentary committee in May 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, those benefits are that the building of a third crossing across Lake Burley Griffin could be avoided and that there would be lower concentrations of air pollutants, lower incidences of noise pollution and lower traffic volumes because traffic would be flowing in both directions, not just into one central location. In other words, it is the basis for a more efficient use of the road system. It would reduce fuel costs, and the costs of road construction and parking construction. In other words, it would disperse traffic around the town and reduce time wasted in travelling. People would be able to work closer to where they live. </PARA>

I am glad that it responded, at least in part, to the petition from hundreds of residents of Gungahlin urging that the committee recommend construction of an office block there. It is very important that it has done this despite the strong pressure that it has experienced from sectional interests.

We are currently conducting a joint metropolitan urban growth strategy review. We should spend a little more time on it and wait for all of the details and facts to come together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to give evidence to the committee. I am pleased to see that it has taken on board my suggestion that perhaps Tuggeranong and Gungahlin should also be considered, as a reaffirmation of the planning principles that underlie Canberra's future. I am grateful for the suggestion that at least one of the departments could be moved to these outer areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we should spend a bit more time discussing the full impact of the plan. In the next six or 12 months a lot of public servants will be moving into the new DFAT building. We need to see what the real influence of that will be on the infrastructure and the future of Barton. A bit more time spent at this stage would save the government, the people of Canberra and the public servants a lot of time, and possibly a lot of money, in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to give evidence. I support the member for Dawson and thank the committee members and the chairman for their work. All the public meetings were full of individuals who were very concerned and willing to give suggestions. I thank the committee for taking into account the Masterbuilders proposal that the smaller and medium sized building firms should not be excluded from the tendering process by conditions that were imposed on them. If we spend more time on these reports, wait for the outcome of some of the other reviews and look at the full picture for Canberra's planning future we will come up with a better and more cost-effective solution to the planning dilemmas that will face Canberra and this country in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I take this opportunity to congratulate the chairman, the members and local members of the committee for their contribution to the 29th report. This will probably be the last time I will have the opportunity to talk on a Public Works Committee report in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Peter Roberts, Mike Fetter and Denise Denahy&mdash;all the people who work in the Public Works Committee office&mdash;have done a great job while I have been serving on the committee. When I was in opposition in the Old Parliament House chamber, I was on the Public Works Committee and Peter Roberts was the assistant secretary. He has done a marvellous job over many years. It has been a privilege to work with him and all the members of the committee, especially the chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that, on the last report of this parliament, I have to talk about some of my very good colleagues in the opposition who had to put in a dissenting report. I understand their concerns. I agree that we had to get through this proposition with haste. It is not the first time we have had to do that. We also had to do it with the hearing we conducted on the control tower in Darwin. It was put through before we knew where we were. We had to have the hearings on the Defence Housing Authority in the Northern Territory before the rainy season. You can only work up there in the dry season. A lot of hard work was done there. We have had to put a lot of rushed propositions through, but we did give them a fair hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman has done a marvellous job in getting the hearing over. I did not have an opportunity to go to the public hearings, but I did go to the briefing the day before the public hearings and had full knowledge of what was being proposed. On the day we had the inspection I had no hesitation in thoroughly agreeing with the committee's recommendation that the Australian Federal Police should go over to Barton. That was the first thing I approved. I totally objected to the proposition of an above-ground car park in this day and age. I can remember many years ago the controversy surrounding a proposal to the Public Works Committee of an above-ground car park at Garden Island. Here we are in 1995 having a proposition like that put to us again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been an easy task for the chairman or the members of the committee. I think we have come up with the best solution. We have a proposition where one of the departments goes to Tuggeranong and the Australian Federal Police to Barton, which I have always agreed with. I hope that Industrial Relations will stay in Civic. I thought that that was a fair proposition. Everyone was concerned. People came to me and said that we should put this off. I also received phone calls from consultants and other people. I have no problem in agreeing with what has finally been decided by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thoroughly endorse the committee's recommendations. I am sad that our opposition colleagues could not be with us on this occasion to agree to this proposal. In their wisdom in the next parliament they will be able to look at the propositions that will be coming back before the Public Works Committee&mdash;hopefully under the chairmanship of the current chair, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). You never know, he might be a minister and we might have a new chairman. It has been a pleasure working with them all&mdash;the chairman and the staff.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Innovation is recognised as a key determinant of economic growth. To prosper in today's rapidly changing world, it is vital that Australia maximise its innovation potential. This report illustrates the breadth of the concept of innovation. Recommendations cover such diverse areas as education; management skills; linkages and networking; research, development and commercialisation; the need for technology `foresighting'; access to finance; and the particular needs of small and medium sized firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Promoting innovation is about cultural change&mdash;fostering creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit. It is not an exercise we can expect to undertake simply in the short term. We must be in it for the long haul. Cultural characteristics are deeply embedded and often resistant to change, but the benefits from a more innovative society will be profound and long lasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately there is little choice. While it is a cliche to say that we live in a world of rapid change, this cliche contains a fundamental truth. As a society we must adapt to change and learn to use it to our advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee noted during the course of its inquiry that there are many programs in place that are designed to promote innovation. Some of these programs have been in place for some time&mdash;for example, the 150 per cent taxation concession for research and development&mdash;and others, such as the enterprise education strategy, are fairly recent initiatives that appear well designed though further time is required before their effectiveness can be properly measured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not consider that there is a need for a suite of new programs. There is a need for a commitment to the continued application of programs already in place. The committee's report does contain, however, a number of recommendations for government action that we believe would make a very positive contribution to the development of Australia as an innovative nation. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to place on record the outstanding work that was done by the staff of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on this report. I wish to thank Mr Paul McMahon, Mr Justin Winton and all of the staff for their assistance in what has been a very good job under rather difficult circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficult circumstances are contained in some reservations which I have attached to the report. Regrettably, there were a number of processes which were implemented by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) which probably affected the proper outcome of the inquiry process. I refer to the inquiry being referred to the committee by the minister on 16 November 1994. Before the referral of the inquiry, the minister had set in train a parallel national consultation process under an innovation task force resourced from within the minister's department. I wish to place on record my dissatisfaction with the course followed by the minister in commissioning parallel inquiry processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three major undesirable consequences from this kind of duplication. Firstly, a degree of public confusion, and perhaps irritation, is inevitably generated. It would not be clear to individuals or organisations why they should be requested to prepare submissions to two separate bodies concerning virtually the same subject. It is certainly not clear to me why such a course was followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the extensive public consultation process set in train by the task force before the committee was able to launch its own inquiry inevitably hindered the gathering of evidence by the committee. For example, the CSIRO indicated to the committee secretariat that, since it was making an input through the innovation task force process, it would not be making a submission to the committee. The minister's department, which is the major relevant policy department&mdash;Industry, Science and Technology&mdash;similarly did not make a submission to the committee because of the task force exercise. There were doubtless many other organisations and individuals who did not convey their views to the committee because they had already contributed or were about to contribute to the task force inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the standing committee of the House of Representatives, which comprises members of all political parties, could have issued a report and recommendations which had wider community support had it not been undermined by the minister's actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that, as a result, the report the committee has been able to produce has suffered to some extent from a lack of direct evidence and opinion given to it. This has resulted in delay in producing a report and a lack of precision in the report's recommendations. I strongly urge ministers in future not to set in train parallel inquiry processes as this is both wasteful of resources and counter-productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to place on record my continued support of the committee staff and my thanks on behalf of all members of the committee for their assistance in putting together a report which has a number of initiatives in it but was compiled under very difficult circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the comments of the member for Bendigo about dual processes, there is some merit, I think, in his observations. There is no doubt that in the future ministers would be well advised to not encourage the dual process to which he referred and with which the committee had to contend. Nevertheless, that is no criticism of the minister. He was seeking as wide a contribution to this area of policy as possible. I think he remitted the inquiry to the committee in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Goodbye bad buys</EMPHASIS>, is the report into the Australian government purchasing policies and Commonwealth authorities and companies, interim second report. It is my pleasure to table this interim second report on behalf of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1994 the committee presented the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Buying our future</EMPHASIS> report, which looked at purchasing practices of government departments. That report proposed major changes to the structure by which purchasing policy was developed and by which its implementation was monitored. The government accepted most of the committee's recommendations in the Working Nation statement. I was involved in that process in a previous incarnation. Its formal response to the report was received in December 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This interim second report has been prepared to promote public consideration and comment before the committee finalises its recommendations. It concentrates on the purchasing policies of Commonwealth authorities and companies, including most statutory authorities and government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first stage of the committee's inquiry did not encompass these bodies, concentrating instead on government departments. There are a number of arguments in favour of extending the government's recent purchasing reforms to public authorities and companies. Extending the reforms would help break down the impediments to local suppliers in obtaining government business. This would benefit not only the companies which gain contracts but also those further down the supply chain. The benefits extend not only to those many industries which supply the needs of government bodies but also of course to the economy as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad economic benefits of increased local procurement are self-evident. When Australian companies are able to demonstrate that they have won government contracts in Australia, this helps to provide them with credibility in export markets. I think that is a point that is often underestimated but increasingly understood. Governments certainly have a role in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has received arguments in favour of and against the extension of purchasing reforms beyond government departments. On balance, the committee favours a wider application of government purchasing policies to Commonwealth authorities and government business enterprises. The report includes a proposed method to achieve this. However, before making a final judgment the committee seeks comment from interested parties on the report's contents and interim recommendations. I commend the report to the House.

Other members of the delegation were Senator Sandy Macdonald, David Connolly from Bradfield, Mary Easson from Lowe, Lindsay Tanner from Melbourne, and Mark Latham from Werriwa.

He was always calm and stable and he created a very good sense of purpose for the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to thank the secretary of the delegation, Neil Bessell. He was hardworking and always pleasant. I am sure that pleasantry was tried on a few occasions. Particularly, he was called in at the last minute to replace Brenton Holmes, who would have been the secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to thank Australia's representatives overseas who helped with the agendas and provided hospitality to us. I refer to our ambassadors: in Paris, Ambassador Hillman to the OECD and Ambassador Brown to France; to the Netherlands, Ambassador Michael Tate; and to Spain, Ambassador Warwick Pearson and Mrs Pearson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly, I refer to our ambassador to Belgium and the European Communities, Ambassador Ted Pocock, and his wife, Meg. I think they have established quite a reputation over a number of years now for the special and personal attention they extend to this annual delegation to the European institutions, which makes it so much more memorable. I think in particular of the arrangements so that we could visit the war cemeteries from the First World War battlefields in Flanders, ending in Ypres, and the laying of a wreath at the Menin Gate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations, because of the significance of this annual delegation to the Flanders area, is that, if possible, future delegations include in their itineraries visits to World War I battlefields and Australian war graves in both France and Belgium. That would give a comprehensive understanding of those great battles and Australia's participation and of the genuine affection that is still there for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to recognise on behalf of the delegation the Spanish Ambassador to Australia and Dr Antonio Nunez, and the then charge d'affaires of the European Community's commission in Australia, Peter van den Heuvel, for the information, advice and support they have given to our delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is a valuable annual delegation to the European institutions, plus this year the bilateral visit to Spain. It is an opportunity for the members of the delegation to learn more about these institutions and to discuss and debate issues, whether it be at the OECD, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, the European Commission in Brussels, NATO, the International Court of Justice, the International War Crimes Tribunal on the former Yugoslavia, the Organisation Prohibiting Chemical Weapons and, finally, the European Parliament in Strasbourg. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier on this occasion, there was also a bilateral visit to Spain. On behalf of the delegation, I again wish to thank our hosts, the Spanish parliament, for their generosity and the very interesting program they arranged for us, highlighted by an audience with Their Majesties King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, the King and Queen of Spain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was fortunate that we were there when Spain occupied the presidency of the European Union. I think the value of the bilateral visit was increased because we were able to have more relevant discussions in relation to what is happening in Europe. One of our recommendations is that in future, where it is possible, the bilateral visit accompanying the annual visit to the European institutions be to the country that has the rotating presidency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer briefly to other recommendations, but particularly to the OECD discussions we had in Paris and then the debate on that OECD report in the parliamentary assembly in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. That is one of the real opportunities delegations from Australia have to actually make a contribution and an impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian delegation is to maximise this opportunity, then that delegation in the future needs to have a better understanding of the system, of the tactics needed. I believe that is only possible, as we recommend, by having some combination of continuity, at least for the leadership of the delegation, and also attendance by at least the leadership at the preliminary meeting which occurs in July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we are not the first to be making such a recommendation. Australia shares this opportunity of participating in the OECD debate with the other non-European OECD countries: that is, Japan, Mexico, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The United States does not take advantage of the opportunity and New Zealand is not always there, but the other countries were. Canada showed all of us what its better understanding of the procedures and the tactics could achieve in having a greater and more comprehensive series of amendments and input into that OECD report; hence the recommendation that we need to be doing at least the same as the Canadians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of agricultural, employment and economic issues, I believe all of the members of our delegation made valuable contributions. Senator Beahan was asked to chair part of the proceedings. He and I were also able to speak in the parliamentary assembly. I would like to conclude by referring to some of the recommendations. Recommendation No. 1 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Delegation considers that the visit to the European Institutions is so  significant, the Leader of the Delegation should be a senior member of the Government or a Presiding Officer. The degree of access enjoyed by Delegations is directly related to the status of the Delegation Leader.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is something that I very firmly and personally support. Recommendation No. 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.in an effort to achieve greater continuity, the Parliament should elect at least two delegates, one from the Government and one from the major opposition party, to remain as permanent delegates for the life of the Parliament;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.these permanent delegates should attend the July Round Table meetings at which the draft resolution on the OECD report is formulated as well as participating in the annual visit to the European Institutions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . notwithstanding the useful briefings given by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra, the Australian Ambassador to the European Communities should provide an extensive briefing when the Delegation arrives in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe there is quite a number of very relevant and valuable recommendations that will lead to an important annual opportunity for members of this parliament to gain a better understanding and dialogue of what is happening in Europe. I recommend that those recommendations be treated seriously. I have much pleasure in presenting the report. </PARA>

Perhaps many of us do not quite recognise that, but that point was made very strongly to us by many people we spoke with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The attitude that the government is now taking to the Senate amendments exposes the scandalous scare campaign that the government has indulged in on university places. What has now occurred is that, by agreeing to amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 in the Senate, the government has been exposed as having been entirely politically motivated in this scare campaign. The coalition throughout has stood firm in opposing the changes to the HECS system. The government has been telling people that there was no way it could avoid cutting these places unless it gained all these amendments. Once again, this has been exposed as completely false. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has been telling this House, the universities and students around Australia that the whole schema would unravel unless the government obtained these measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has made it clear that it did not believe this and that it was all a matter of the government's priorities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $12 million that was involved in these amendments would have been enough to pay for the additional places which Mr Crean was threatening to cut from Queensland next year. It is quite clear that the money for these places was there all along. The government now appears to be targeting university research funding as the next victim of its political blackmail campaign. The government has been prepared to attack the students and the universities and threaten them with blackmail in an effort to get its way. When the Senate continued to insist on its amendments, the government backed down and has said that the places will come through anyway. As we move towards possibly an election campaign early in the new year, I think we can now see just how much credence can be placed on the government's word. This has been a classic case study in misrepresenting the situation, and the misrepresentation is now fully exposed. </PARA>

I want to say on behalf of the coalition that, in our view, the National Union of Students has given too much ground too easily in accepting the government's claim that the increased HECS take was needed to fund the additional university places. It has indicated its clear support for the government. </PARA>

The NUS must be very embarrassed and humiliated by the fact that the government has now left it high and dry in backing down to the Senate's insistence on these amendments. Students in universities around Australia will note the willingness of the NUS to go along with the government's scare campaign on this matter. The fact that the government has now backed down and said that places will now come through has not only humiliated the government and exposed the falsity of its statements but also humiliated the National Union of Students.

Who is the person who came in here and stood at this dispatch box day after day over the last few weeks and months and defended the minister and said, `Yes, she should still have a place on this front bench'? Who is the person who set out and attempted day after day in this place to smear the reputation of the royal commissioner, a man who had served faithfully and honourably as a Supreme Court judge in Victoria&mdash;a man who had been called upon even by a government instrumentality to act as an arbitrator or a mediator in one of its matters but who, nonetheless, was smeared here?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is the man who came in here and said that somehow the Marks royal commission was just a Liberal Party conspiracy, when all those who gave evidence and spoke out against Dr Lawrence were former members of the Labor Party cabinet in Western Australia or advisers to Dr Lawrence herself?

Of course, included in their number is none other than the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) himself. That person is the Prime Minister of this country, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely this will go down as one of the more scandalous events so far as this parliament is concerned. Integrity in politics and political life is such that a person who has been found to have deceived the people of Australia&mdash;and found conclusively, without any ifs or buts by a royal commissioner&mdash;continues to sit on the front bench of this government and continues to be defended by the Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>

That is a question that Australians ought to ask themselves, and they ought to ask why the Prime Minister of this country has let that situation occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, we found out last night what happens when the Prime Minister does not like the views of one of his Labor Party members. In this the Year of Tolerance a member of the Labor Party cannot speak out&mdash;and whether or not you agree with what he said is not the point. The member for Kalgoorlie undoubtedly represents the views that are expressed by a range of Australians. Whether I agree with them, my colleagues agree with them or the minister at the table, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), agrees with them is hardly the point. What happens to a member of the Labor Party who expresses views which are uncomfortable to the Prime Minister or which may not be politically correct at the time? In the words of a former Minister for Finance, Peter Walsh, he is put before a kangaroo court and drummed out of the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask people to contrast these two events. As the member for Kalgoorlie said himself: you get drummed out of the ALP these days for expressing views which you honestly believe in, but if you are found conclusively to have deceived the Australian people this Prime Minister proposes that the taxpayers of Australia should fork out up to $700,000 or $800,000 in order to pay for the incurred legal fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a scandal. It is one of the low points in the history of this government. We on this side of the House originally said that we would demand that the taxpayers' money only be used to a limited extent. We said we would pay what had been paid in the past in royal commissions&mdash;that is, the fees for a person to appear before a royal commission&mdash;but that we were not prepared to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for challenges. That money being used is not our money, not the government's money nor the ALP's money; it is the money of the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were not prepared to have that money allocated and used for numerous challenges to try to cut off this royal commission and its inquiry into those events which happened in Western Australia. We were not prepared to do so then, and the Senate is not prepared to do so now. All we can say is that the government has caved in on this matter and said that it will accept this amendment&mdash;not because that is its mind in this matter but simply because it wants the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) to pass through this parliament before it rises, which will probably be later today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that it was entirely inappropriate to establish that royal commission, it was entirely appropriate that the government support the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in funding her case.

And that royal commission was not reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to use this opportunity to draw attention to what appears to be another unreasonable example of misjudged public administration that has occurred in the ACT and which it is important to report to this parliament on because it was raised last week. It relates to a proposal to locate the Department of Environment, Land and Planning in Dickson&mdash;a service centre in the ACT, not an employment centre. The Chief Minister of the ACT recommended against this location, yet public servants went ahead and decided to advertise, not with that particular location mentioned but they called for expressions of interest. Within a couple of months of the Chief Minister having said that it should not be at the place which was finally decided on, it went ahead there. This was clearly bad public administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I made these comments in the House about a week ago, I have been making further inquiries about the incident to try to establish as accurately as possible the full facts. I am now told that the placing of the advertisement for a new building for DELP was undertaken by the Department of Urban Services with the approval of its minister at the time, Mr Lamont. That could well be true, though I have been unable to verify it. But in any case it was clearly contrary to the express written instructions of the Chief Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advertisement was placed during an election period without anyone checking with the Chief Minister. At the very least, this is unprofessional public administration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been making other inquiries and have learned that the lease for the site of the DELP building in Dickson was awarded to Dickson Developments in March, only two months after the first advertisement calling for expressions of interest. I have found out that the lease is for five years and issued for an annual rental of $245,000, 10 per cent of the site value. The lease entitles the developer to deduct from the annual rental the costs of off site public works estimated at $517,000, and I have now been told that these off site public works are Chinese gates for Dickson, infrastructure for a Chinese market, and some pedestrian and parking changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that at least some of these off site works have nothing to do with the government office block for which the lease has been issued.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Howe, who was elected in 1977, became a minister in 1983, as did Michael Duffy who was elected in 1980. Jeannette McHugh was elected in 1983. Peter Staples and Wendy Fatin were elected the same year. All three have been ministers. Ben Humphreys came earlier in 1977 and became Minister for Veterans' Affairs. David Simmons came in 1983 and Alan Griffiths came in 1983. For the bulk of that group it is 12 years and for Brian Howe and Ben Humphreys it is 18 years, which is a long part of your life. </PARA>

I would like to take this opportunity just to mention Brian Howe, my former Deputy Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to record how much I have appreciated the time I have had with him here in the parliament during the period when we were members of the Expenditure Review Committee in the 1980s, when he was Minister for Social Security and Minister for Health. A lot of the matrix of the social programs of the Commonwealth came from those years. Brian always worked indefatigably&mdash;I underline the word `indefatigably'&mdash;and creatively to look at the priorities of the government, even the former government, and to re-sort them and to do it in a way which gave working Australians a fairer share of the national cake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many great changes were made, some very radical ones&mdash;things like the family allowance supplement and the Child Support Agency, which is innovative in world terms. Of course he has gone on more latterly to be involved in the Commonwealth's involvement in cities with better cities, which has improved the way in which the country has functioned&mdash;the Commonwealth's relationship with the states and doing some things in the major cities and provincial cities that might not otherwise have been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the caucus meeting the other day that Brian enjoyed more substantial power than probably anybody in the Left of the Labor Party, or in the Left in Australia, since the war.

Whilst he was succeeded by Neal Blewett and then by Peter Cook and we brought the round to a close, it was, of course, done over seven years and his was a mighty contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, Michael Duffy became Attorney-General and distinguished himself in that portfolio. But, like his colleague I mentioned earlier, Brian Howe, the thing I will remember them both for is their work in the corporate layer of the cabinet as cabinet colleagues. A cabinet minister is not like any other portfolio minister; a cabinet minister is somebody who has to take the responsibilities on in a corporate sense, who has an interest in every issue that comes along, not just their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that, we could always rely on Michael to understand the broad range of what the government was doing through the sense of earthiness and compassion he has always had and with his sure touch with advice. Upon leaving office and going to the back bench, having been at centre stage and on the front foot for so long, a reasonably deft change of personality was required too, and he did that well. He has represented the people of Holt with great distinction and it has been a great parliamentary and ministerial career. We will miss him. </PARA>

He served with a number of coalition governments over the period where he had portfolio responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always thought that Don was one of the people that kept the link between the parliament as it is in a more contemporary guise and how it used to be when he and I first came here. At that time the executive government played less of a role in the management of Australia, and the cabinet and the ministry also had less of a role in the management of the Commonwealth. It was in the days when the bureaucracy played a greater role than it does today in policy development and when the parliament had a more discursive role than perhaps it does in this contemporary setting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days, second reading speeches were reported in the press often and widely. If a member made the effort to give a quality second reading contribution, it would be reported. Much of that has changed with radio and television, and with the focus on question time a lot of the more thoughtful contributions of members are basically ignored by the media&mdash;I think more is the pity. The second reading debate is a time when people on the back bench can actually say something in the parliament of note and have it noticed.

He has been more than a little unlucky in not seeing ministerial office, which within the National Party he was entitled to see. While he does not leave here having been a minister, but for time and circumstance he would have very well become a minister in the National Party and the coalition government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could turn to my own side, I would like to start with Don Dobie. He first entered parliament as the member for Hughes in 1966. He entered at the Harold Holt landslide&mdash;at least, we thought it was a landslide until we came to 1975. The Harold Holt victory of 1966, until then, was the greatest victory that our side of politics had had. Don Dobie held the seat after the redistribution. He held the seat of Cook when Hughes was basically cut in half. The more Labor part of it remained as Hughes and the Liberal part of it was Cook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To Don, I want to record the thanks of a very grateful party for a very long stint in parliament. You have always acted out your respect for the parliamentary institution and you have been a reminder to all of us of the traditions of that. You have made a very effective contribution in the chamber and in our parliamentary party room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well remember some of the political warnings you delivered to the then government in 1982, particularly about some things that at that time were working against our interests. I have remembered those to this day. The same applies for our years in opposition in the 1980s. Janette and I extend to you, Don, our very best wishes and thanks for what you have done for our party and for the way in which you have represented your constituents. I know many of Don's constituents. There are few people on either side of politics who have cared for their flock quite as effectively and as attentively as Don has. He really has been a quintessentially superb local member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steele Hall, by any definition, has had a remarkable political career. To be Premier of a state and to be active in implementing a piece of legislation which almost certainly guaranteed, if not his demise, that he would be politically challenged in a very strong sense was quite a remarkable feat. Steele Hall, over the years, would have been seen within my party and amongst those who follow politics very closely as coming from a different philosophical section of liberalism from the one I would perhaps be seen as coming from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been occasions when we have had radically different views on people, issues and party management. But I have grown over those years to have a deepening respect for his political acumen. Some of the things that he said in our party meetings before the last election turned out to be remarkably perspicacious and accurate. To Steele and his wife Joan and their family, I extend very warm thanks for the contribution he has made over the 20-odd years he has been in federal parliament and, before that, the years as a member of the South Australian parliament, as Premier of South Australia and as a member of the Liberal Party in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Connolly and I entered parliament on the same day. I remember the rainy day of 18 May 1974 extremely well when for the first time we used those huge ballot papers. We had something like 74 people trying to hand out those damned things in the pouring rain and there were 74 candidates for the Senate. I say very warmly and very genuinely that I am sorry that David is leaving us. One of the more brutal parts of politics is the preselection system. It is part of the political process and we all face the possibility of it affecting us. That is no criticism of people who replace sitting members in preselection ballots but, to me, it represents a tinge of sadness that a person who has been in this place for the length of time David has is leaving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of luck in politics. When people come in at the same time, a Prime Minister or a caucus has to make a decision as to which one to give the job to. The other person just misses out, and just missing out can mean the difference between being on the front bench for most of the time you are in parliament and not being on the front bench or not being a minister. David has had less than his reasonable share of luck. I think he has enormous ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the times I have been Leader of the Opposition he has been an extremely effective policy maker. An example is the work he did on retirement incomes in the late 1980s. He was the first person on the front bench of any party to debate the idea of reversing the trend towards early retirement. David began very early in the piece to argue that we should allow people to stay in the work force longer. That was quite pioneering. So, David, I wish you and Monique well in your future life. I am sure we will continue to see a great deal of you around Sydney. </PARA>

Bruce and I served together as members of the coalition leadership team between 1987 and May of 1989&mdash;after the 1987 election until May 1989. I found him in every way a decent, straightforward, uncomplicated believer in those things that were important to regional Australia and to the bush. He filled the shoes of the legendary Black Jack McEwen when he took over the seat of Murray in 1971&mdash;and I think he had some of the traditions of his famous predecessor in that seat.

Bruce and I, along with Ray Braithwaite, were at the centre of some of the more difficult years that the coalition had in the late 1980s&mdash;certainly surrounding the early months of 1987. Ray Braithwaite was a senior member of the Queensland national section of the National Party in that time, when the party experienced the difficulties that any political party experiences when there are internal tensions of a protracted kind. We all have to be up-front enough to acknowledge that, whether the tensions occur in our party or in another party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ray resigned from the front bench of the coalition over the sugar issue before the 1993 election. He did so because he believed that the decision the coalition took on that issue was not in the interests of his constituents. He did it at a time when it was expected that the coalition would win that election, and in making that decision Ray was clearly putting at risk the possibility of becoming a minister in a future coalition government. I respected him for doing it at that time, and his electors did too. The seat of Dawson is by no means a lay-down misere for our side of politics, but he has held it continuously since 1975. I wish to thank both him and Bruce for the contribution they have made not only to the National Party but to the broader coalition cause. </PARA>

I am happy to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in acknowledging that and, at the outset, acknowledging the heavy workload of those who sit in the chair&mdash;the Speaker; you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins; and other deputy speakers&mdash;and the contribution they make to the running of this House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our focus is on former members. Let me begin with Bruce Lloyd&mdash;former deputy leader of the National Party; member for Murray for all these years; a person who, particularly in 1990 but also at other times, gave me great help, assistance and guidance; a person whose determination and dedication knows no bounds. In his knowledge of primary industries, he is without peer. He has served on a range of committees and performed a range of other roles for the National Party, for the coalition and for the community. This reflects the diligence with which he always approached his task as the federal member for Murray over the years. I wish Bruce and his family well, and salute that dedicated and determined service. At the same time, Bruce, I still have an argument with you in regard to who should have paid for that dinner at the Hotel Eaton in London in 1974-75. Eventually we will settle that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Ray Braithwaite, the member for Dawson, I too reiterate the comments made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. He was very courageous in representing his electorate and in representing not only the sugar industry but also other industries for which he was the catalyst. That continues right through to these moments, when once again he is in there pushing for the protection of building industry subcontractors involved with government projects. He is doing that in a way which is about fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that is what Ray Braithwaite has been about&mdash;fairness, with a dignity attaching to his work as the member for Dawson, as the representative of that very challenging electorate in Queensland. We knew that, if Ray&mdash;in his frontbench, middle bench or back bench role&mdash;gave his word, that counted, as it did with Bruce Lloyd. Ray, I wish you and Mavis well in the future. I know that you will continue to think first, as you always have, of the nation, of what is in the best interests of people and of what is fair in the circumstances. You deserve the accolades of everybody in this House, and we thank you for your service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say of the retiring Liberal members&mdash;and I know a lot of members want to speak about them this afternoon&mdash;the member for Cook, Don Dobie; the member for Bradfield, David Connolly; the member for Deakin, Ken Aldred; and the member for Boothby, Steele Hall, that I have enjoyed very good working relations with them all. I have not always agreed with some of the comments that they have made from time to time, but each of them has covered the ground in their electorates against the odds. I have personally enjoyed and learnt from many of the comments and contributions that you have made. I wish all of you well and congratulate you for the years of service you have given to the parliament and the nation. Steele Hall has served not only this parliament but also the South Australian state parliament as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Labor side there is a long list of retiring members.

I genuinely wish all those retiring members well. I enjoyed working with and the courtesies extended by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, Brian Howe, particularly with regard to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation which is part of his portfolio. When I was the new shadow minister for veterans' affairs the member for Griffith, Ben Humphreys, was a fair and courteous opponent and one who genuinely had the wellbeing of the veterans first and foremost in his mind as he went about administering that challenging portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say with respect to the member for Holt, Michael Duffy, that he knows more than I do about Albury because he was brought up in Albury. He is always welcome at the Albury and Wagga racecourses. I hope you bring some good tips in your retirement. I am disappointed that yesterday it was confirmed publicly for the first time that the World Trade Organisation rejected the Australian nominee on the short list for the disputes panel. Michael Duffy was in the final list. He was deserving of that support as a former Attorney-General and as a former minister for trade. One or two of the Europeans apparently blocked that nomination. I wish him well with his consultancies. We hope that further breakthroughs may occur. </PARA>

I thank my parliamentary colleagues in the National Party for their help, support and assistance. I thank my friend the Leader of the Opposition, the member for the Bennelong, the cricket fan, John Howard. I appreciate very much the good working relationship we have along with his deputy, Peter Costello, and the Manager of Opposition Business, Peter Reith. It is a busy place.

Lyn&mdash;and I feel terribly guilty about this because I would have liked to have attended the ceremony&mdash;was awarded, most deservedly, a high honour in the Australian awards. He was invested a few weeks ago. That not only reflects extremely well on him but also reflects very well on Ian Harris and all the other staff&mdash;David Elder, who is the Serjeant-at-Arms. They are the people who put an enormous effort in ensuring that this House is run with great professionalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are one or two points of disappointment that they feel during the year. I know that there is a sentiment among the clerks that the Senate has exceeded its powers in a number of areas, that we have not fully tested them in the way in which perhaps we ought to, and that expediency rules in order to simply get the business of government done. But when they remind us in a timely manner of the dignities and responsibilities of this House, they nevertheless perform that element of their function that goes beyond efficiency to being very much, even more than we are, the keepers of the traditions of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank too my leader, the Prime Minister, who has been one of the great reforming politicians of this nation, one of the toughest parliamentary performers, and almost, but not quite, father of the House&mdash;there is Don Dobie and Ian Sinclair. Nevertheless, he is a very long-serving parliamentarian. He has graced this place in a very controversial manner. Nevertheless, when the history books are written centuries on, whilst many of us will have, if we are lucky, footnotes, he will have chapters. We wish him, Annita and the family a very happy, peaceful, calm Christmas and hope that he comes back thoroughly refreshed. There is no doubt about it at all: he is our chief warhorse and, as the new year rolls in, he will have to roll out and do the task yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish his opponent a personally satisfying life, if not politically satisfying life, and hope that he also enjoys Christmas with his family. He is a man devoted to his family, as is our leader. That is obviously a source of joy for him. They are loyal children&mdash;as we have occasion to know from a couple of television broadcasts during this year&mdash;and, as a father, having loyal children is always one of the blessings you hope for and do not necessarily always get. I think that the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard&mdash;also a great parliamentary performer and parliamentarian&mdash;deserves a peaceful and joyous Christmas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rely, as Leader of the House, enormously on our whips. I think that the whipping position has changed in this parliament.

Leo, Ted and Rod do a terrific job for us. I am sure they would want me to pass on their thanks too to their opposition counterparts, led by Bob Halverson, with whom they deal and with whom they run the Main Committee. The Main Committee is not run by ministers; it is run by the whips on both sides.

There is a great incentive for me to get re-elected and to help get the government re-elected on this occasion because at the moment Brian shares something with me, Gareth Evans and Ralph Willis. The four of us are the longest serving Labor federal ministers. The Prime Minister, you will recollect, had a brief break, which interrupted the record creating capacities on his part despite service in a previous government. That is an extraordinary achievement for Brian. He has been in many ways&mdash;though he has not flaunted it, and that is why he has been effective at it&mdash;a conscience of the Labor Party. He has not wandered around with a badge saying `I am the conscience of the Labor Party'; he has simply done the job. In the tough times that we have been through over the last 13 years, he has been there with the advice on when to go in and when not to go in too hard in the process of change, and he has been one of those who have built up what is a very well thought out and effective social safety net. </PARA>

He has for a long time been regarded by many people as an alternative leader of the Labor Party, and I think he was, without any doubt at all. When you see the delights of family life that Alan is now confronted with, the opportunities that are there for him in business, you can understand that for him to stay here would be an act of pure madness. But on those acts of pure madness the political system relies, and I am sorry that he is not going to be continuing an act of pure madness and staying here but is departing.

There will be in caucus gatherings a more peaceful 10 minutes than you can currently guarantee, as you could rely on one or both of them to get up and say what everybody was thinking but nobody wanted to say because they wanted to keep the peace of the place and keep it moving along nicely and in a harmonious fashion.

On the second of those categories, Jeanette will take it down on the other side of the ledger when she leaves this place.

To fall a victim to a Labor Party member who has never voted Liberal in his life must indeed be extraordinarily galling for him because in the seat that he represents he would never have expected to be taken out by a Labor Party candidate.

The committee has taken the opportunities provided by the general reference to it of the Reserve Bank's annual report to forge a new relationship of accountability with the Reserve Bank.

Ted Mack's entry into this place as an independent was an extraordinary achievement in itself. I understand that in his electorate he had street committees. He has been able to forge a grassroots support base that actually won him the seat off John Spender. His interest in encouraging public participation in the democratic process is one which I have shared. We actually teamed up with the Democrats, when I was in the sin-bin a year or so ago, to promote a particular proposal which would achieve a greater public participation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to my introduction to parliament in 1977, in opposition, through the standing committee on the environment, which was a very good and exciting committee. It was the time of the Franklin Dam issue and there were very big environmental concerns. I have always remembered the staff of that committee&mdash;Allan Kelly, John Cummins and Lyn Symons, who later became serjeant&mdash;for the professionalism with which they served that committee. It was a very creative committee. One of the interesting things about that committee was the way it operated across party lines with people like Barry Simon and Marshal Baillieu, in many ways, being as strong environmentalists as Barry Cohen or any other member of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Library was referred to earlier by Peter Reith. I thought, in the early days in opposition, the library was fantastic. I got enormous help from the library when making any contribution I made to the parliament. The library is very important in opposition in balancing the power of the executive. Knowledge is power and the staff of the library were always extremely professional and very informed. People like Jim Dunn were very passionate about East Timor. In the Left of the Labor Party, that was an issue that we felt strongly about. Jim Dunn certainly made a huge contribution. But there were many people in the Parliamentary Library who, I thought, made a tremendous contribution. </PARA>

As it turned out, the function resulted in a dreadful blue because Moss Cass thought we might not support Tom Uren as the deputy leader. He thought Ralph Willis might get up over Lionel Bowen.

It tended to follow Tom or Arthur, and it was never quite clear who was in and who was out. It always seemed to me that the Right had curiously few meetings but the Left met more often. As I argued for more participatory decisions, it met more and more frequently. The Left gave one a home, friendships, and very much a sense of direction. Over time we got to have a greater degree of formality but I think we also had a group which had strong bonds based on the various movements with which we were involved whether it was the peace movement, anti-poverty groups or the trade union movement. To be in the Left was not to be in politics as a professional; it was to be in politics because you believed that you could achieve certain outcomes. It was a continuation of what you had been doing outside of politics but it presented for you enormous opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remember when parliament was a rather different place. Meeting late down in the old House and the Milo club would give you the opportunity to meet other members and soak up Labor and parliamentary tradition.

He told me about what he thought was Bill Hayden's greatest contribution in Social Security&mdash;that is, he created what was then called the development division. That was a policy division within the Department of Social Security that had been established, had grown and had become quite a formidable policy division by the time we returned to government in 1983. Before Bill Hayden, social security policy had been made in Treasury. Wilenski said, `If you want to take my advice, you will get everything out of that division that you possibly can.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in Social Security, Derek Volker was a superb implementer of policy and was absolutely unswerving in his view that, if the minister made a decision, that is what happened in the Public Service. One thing that the Prime Minister and I agree on is that ministers who do not drive government departments get absolutely lost. They really become, in a sense, quite dangerous. They really need the leadership of ministers and the ministers' offices. Derek Volker was a superb administrator where clear policy decisions were being made. Andrew Podger is my current permanent head and is my choice. I have great respect for him. Charlie Holton is my first permanent head. Michael Duffy and I have conversations from time to time about Charlie's value. For me, he has been tremendous because he gave me the confidence that I needed to be a minister. There may be some other views about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sought to develop a methodology in being a minister. That methodology has really involved a series of policy reviews. That has given continuity in the process of change and has enabled change to be driven quite successfully in social policy. That methodology really arose out of an experience I had with the royal commission into poverty in the 1970s, which I felt did not produce much by way of administrative change. I felt that a series of reviews was a way to achieve change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I owe a great deal to Professor Bettina Cass of Sydney University in relation to the social security review. She had a marvellous sense of equity and a sense of the linkages involved in policy. Very often in the past we thought incrementally. When you put up a cabinet submission, the submission was always in isolation. It did not recognise the interrelationship within one portfolio and the linkages across portfolios. Some of the reforms that came out of Bettina Cass's review are virtually unprecedented. An example is the child support scheme. Three departments cooperated to produce that outcome, all of which in their own way were opposed to having responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking to Carmen Zanetti from the department the other day about JET, the jobs, education and training scheme, which is going extremely well. It is almost unique in its approach to sole parents. If you went to Britain and looked at the British policy on sole parents, you would hardly believe that at the end of the 20th century it could be possible that policy so reactionary should continue to be in place. Bettina Cass was extraordinarily creative and played a very important role in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meredith Edwards, who is now a deputy secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, is John Burton's daughter. John Burton was a distinguished public servant in the Chifley government. Meredith Edwards was the first woman to achieve that status in the Prime Minister's department. Hopefully, she will achieve an even higher status in that department in the future. The national housing strategy was important because not in the whole 50 years of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement had we thought about the fundamentals of housing policy in the way that Meredith did in that review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jenny Macklin worked on the health strategy. She was involved in a series of reforms which produced the national mental health strategy. It was the first time that the Commonwealth had worked like this with the states. It was not the result of Burdekin but the result of Jenny Macklin's work in the review, which also picked up Burdekin's helpful suggestions. There are many other reforms in health that I will not go on about. Jenny Macklin played a key role there and will be a very important member of this parliament when she is elected early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been associated with many social reforms. I feel that social policy is now regarded with much greater respect than it was 13 years ago. Social policy has been given a standing alongside economic policy. That means that we are able to, in a sense, get the balance of policy right in Australia. That is one of the strengths of our contribution in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social justice strategy is one of the great achievements of the Left of the Labor Party. I know that it is widely supported, but I think social justice was very much pushed at the 1986 conference by people from my area of the Labor Party. I say that not to crow about the Left but to say that sometimes the Left is not recognised for the contributions that it has made. It has made an enormous contribution there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are starting to contemplate a republic. As I listened to Andrew Theophanous and the Prime Minister at the launch of a book on multiculturalism this morning, I thought of the potential for the development of our ideas in social justice and links with citizenship. The debate in Europe about the nature of human rights within the European Community very much centres around citizenship. The seeds are there for very radical changes in thinking to be developed. I would like to think that our group was very important in all that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly believe in working very closely with caucus committees. I want to thank the various caucus committees that I have been associated with from the day I came into parliament. I have been associated with social type committees. Those committees play a very important role. I want to mention two people who were never ministers but who played an enormously important role in the committee process. Senator Pat Giles and Senator John Coates were never given recognition in terms of ministerial rank. They were amazing contributors to the process of social reform. We would never have had a child support scheme if it had not been for Pat Giles. The rewriting and reform of the Social Security Act in plain English was a massive achievement of this government. John Coates played a huge role, on behalf of caucus, in spending time going through much of that draft legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a single person to whom I owe most in my time in parliament, it is Gerry Hand. Gerry and I are very complementary people. Gerry is everything that I am not. He is very social and gregarious. He has an enormous negotiating capacity and a capacity to lift people to see that there is something more important than a narrow interest. We would be ready to take an opposition position. Gerry would come into the group and say, `No. There is a way through here. If we are tough enough to negotiate it, we can come out with a good result.' We owe an enormous amount to Gerry in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a reform, the creation of ATSIC was a huge achievement. At a time when we needed an approach which really transferred power to Aboriginal people and opened up the possibility of a genuine recognition of the rights of Aboriginal people as citizens, ATSIC was a huge building block or step along the way. No-one without Gerry's negotiating skills could have achieved that. Robert Tickner would readily acknowledge that it was an amazing negotiating achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great things about being in this government has been the way that the ministry has operated. I cannot go through all ministers, but I think the really nice thing about it has been that&mdash;apart from me; I tend to get very emotional and go over the top&mdash;on the whole we have had very little conflict in cabinet over 13 years. We have had our disputes, but on the whole they have remained in cabinet. We had a bit of a rocky period there with the leadership change. But, on the whole, this government has been extraordinarily disciplined and extremely professional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people with whom my relationships have not been the best. But I knew that it would not affect their approach in cabinet&mdash;either their or my submissions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to mention my staff. A minister owes everything to his staff. Tom Uren gave us all a fair bit of advice. But one of the best pieces of advice he gave me&mdash;apart from his great aphorisms like `Everything is connected to everything else,' and `The best you can ever hope for are the crumbs that blow off the table'&mdash;was when he said, `Well, make sure you get yourself very good staff.' I have had very, very committed and loyal staff. Netta Burns, who is in the gallery, who worked for every Social Security Labor minister, I think, until me, from the 1970s right through, and who worked with the British Labour Party in the immediate postwar period, is just a fantastic chief of staff to have in your office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just mention Roy Forward, Lynne Chester, Lynne Gallagher, Tom Brennan and Rob Hudson&mdash;all very, very formidable people. Everyone in my office has always worked, I think, with a sense of it being the team that is important to get the overall outcome. Ray O'Halloran I owe a particular debt to. Ray came to work with me at a time which was a difficult period. Personally, he has been of enormous support and, apart from anything else, he is just a fantastic bloke, a great guy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just conclude by saying that I know this is a long set of remarks, but I do feel that it is important to go out, as the Prime Minister would say, `decently', and that one ought to refer to some of these things. I certainly think that, as a government, we have much to be proud of and, particularly in such difficult economic times, to have made sure that the systems of social protection and social solidarity, as they say, I think, correctly in Europe, have been enhanced in often really good ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot more to be done, and I just wanted to mention in conclusion some of the things which I think need to be done. I think we do need to define citizenship, down the track, in terms of the new republic, not just in a narrow sense but in the philosophical sense that I referred to and that Andrew Theophanous has referred to in his book today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We clearly need to put a lot more women in parliament. I think some of the people who have worked for me would be superb parliamentarians. The old arguments really do not now apply. We now have women who should be promoted in the Public Service, but we still have a long way to go in the Public Service. We also have women on both sides of politics who should be in parliament in much larger numbers. If we do not achieve that, talking about social justice seems academic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly support some kind of special representation of Aboriginal people in the parliament itself. We cannot go on debating in this chamber, without indigenous Australians being here, physically. I think we need to put enormous effort into young people and into education. I think Anne Harding's work on terms of life cycle distribution of income suggests that we are spending relatively too high a proportion of income at the wrong end of the spectrum. I think we need to be thinking about education in terms of quality and in terms of investment in the future, even more substantially than we have done so far. I would hope that cities remain on the national agenda, and that we build on the regional development initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the UN Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen was, I thought, an extremely important conference. The Australian government has actually made some decisions on follow-up.

I can remember being lobbied from day one, because I had made the announcement that I was voting for Lionel Bowen instead of Bill Hayden. You can imagine how that went down in Queensland at the time. So we had phone calls from everywhere. I thought, well, I can just ride this out, because I had made my decision. In 1975, when I was a candidate, nobody wanted to know us, as you all know. There was no money forthcoming for donations. It was just lucky that I had been a small businessman for many, many years and that I had a few dollars in the pocket so that I could afford to run a campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Lionel Bowen was the man. I think it was Don Dunstan who had promised to come and do this function, but we did not have too many who turned up at the function, I can assure you. However, Don pulled out at the last minute and Lionel Bowen stepped into the chamber and came up, and we had a very good meeting. I have always had a great respect for Lionel Bowen. I must say that, after I made known whom I was voting for, Lionel said to me, `Have you still got your business?' I said, `Yes, I've kept that going.' And he said, `Well, don't sell it yet.' That is what I mean; I did not think I would be here for that long. </PARA>

He was a great mate of Johnno Johnson. They did a lot of hard work behind the scenes to get me into the New South Wales Right also. But it was not hard to stay there, because I found them to be a very decent group of people&mdash;even though we hear some stories from time to time.

It was not easy to do at times, I can assure you. Brian made a few remarks about how he was into the Left more than I was into the Right, and the next minute there was a knock on the door again. When Hawkey arrived, he said, `We are going to challenge Bill Hayden again.' I thought, `Here is another chance for me to have another vote.' I have a great respect for Bill Hayden, but Bill and I knew where we stood at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hawkey was going to challenge Bill Hayden again. We were involved in another vote and were running around the place. All of this lobbying about trying to knock off leaders and all the rest of it were some of the worst times in my life. It was not all that easy. Anyway, Bob could not do the count, could not do the numbers, as certain people had told him. When I walked into the room, I think that Bob had George Georges and somebody else with him, and someone came up to me and said, `They can't count either,' so we knew that Bob was gone from day one.

I can remember Bob coming down and having a talk to me. There was a division on at the time. He put his arm around me and said, `Mate, I'm the only one who can lead you and win the next election. I'll never forget you if you vote for me. Really, I need you&mdash;after all the things that I have done for you.' I said, `No, mate, I'm sorry. It's too late.' Senator Dominic Foreman was a good mate. He had decided to vote for Paul. Bob came and put his arm around him and told the same old story, and Dominic changed his mind and voted for Bob.

I am not going to comment on who I voted for and who I did not vote for, but merely point out that in the time I have been here we have had eight different leaders of my party, one of them twice. I will argue with Ben later about the problems of electing leaders. I am not disclosing to one soul who I voted for, though I think they may know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I want to thank you, Mr Speaker, for the parliament's indulgence in permitting me to make a valedictory address on what may be the last sitting day of the 37th parliament&mdash;particularly as there are 18 of us retiring from this House, not including the number who are going to lose their seats on both sides in this coming election. For my own part, I support what Ben just said. I believe we are going to be back here on 13 February, and I have arranged to come back from an overseas trip on that very morning so I shall be here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I seem to have difficulty reading this speech, I have to apologise. In recent weeks I have punctured my eyeball and I am having difficulty in reading, let alone talking. All of us in this place can talk under water, but I am not expecting a flood at the moment!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that pleases me is that, after nearly three decades in this place, I am retiring of my own volition. It is a great source of satisfaction to me that there was no sense of pressure to stand down from anybody&mdash;in the Liberal Party or beyond, and certainly not from this place. Having lost my seat during the Whitlam years, 20 years ago, one of my ambitions was to retire at a time of my own choosing. That has been the case. That is what is happening now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said when I wrote to each elector in my electorate of Cook after I had made my decision earlier in the year, I believe my constituents are entitled to be represented by a younger person for the second half of the 1990s and beyond. I am pleased to announce that the new Liberal Party candidate for Cook is the Hon. Stephen Mutch MLC, who I am sure will be a worthy successor, a good member of the House and a popular person with the electors of Cook. I wish him every success in the coming months, and he goes forward with my strongest possible support. I am pleased to say that he and his wife are well aware of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been here for such a long and thoroughly satisfying time, I do not intend to now berate the parliament with a long harangue of what I think should be changed or improved, or what statutory rules should be altered. I have enough confidence in our form of democracy to think that it will survive and that its traditions will influence new members far more than new members can change those traditions. I think it is vital for all of us on both sides of the House to remember that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that we&mdash;both executive and non-executive members of this House&mdash;should not take care to protect all that is good within the traditions. For example, I believe that Deputy Prime Minister Beazley's 90-second speech time has been a notable success for all backbenchers. However, as the minister well knows, I have never approved of his decision to ensure that all parliamentary committees should be directed either by the executive or the parliament as to what they should investigate. The decision to allow these committees to choose their own investigative subjects should be returned, and for all time. It will give more incentive and no greater workload for committee members. It may give a trifle more work to the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting away from the serious side, I should point out that I think there is something wrong in some of my colleagues referring to me as the `father of the House'. I think it is slightly obscene for a bachelor member to have that title! However, it is good to have served for so long and to have enjoyed it all&mdash;the bad as well as the good. I enjoyed having earned the title of `honourable' when I was in Prime Minister Bill McMahon's ministry. I do not know that I am going to enjoy the state funeral that that entitles me to!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never had a seat on the front bench on either side of the parliament, but I am still retiring happy. I think more members of this parliament should be happier being members of the parliament and not constantly trying to meet an ambition. That applies to a lot of people in this place&mdash;now and in the future. I hope they can understand, as the British Commons teaches us, that being a member of parliament is the real point. That is what we should be proceeding with from now on. I hope my side of the House follows that through. You can get much more personal satisfaction from being a local member than you can get from going through the ambitious situations that people seem to keep on going through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to at this stage pay a tribute to the five electorate secretaries I have had since 1966. Each of them has been a caring, concerned person and we have enjoyed each other's company. All have greatly contributed to creating the good reputation of the office I am about to leave. I refer to Lynette Peterson, now Mrs Lalor; Pat Williamson, who died recently; Gwen Ridoutt; Betty Leigh; and my present secretary, Edna Davis, who I hope will be the secretary of the next member for Cook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other staff have been and are: Robyn Smith; Mark Bowmer; Mark Wakefield, a footballer; Martin Cole; and David Leslie.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like everyone with whom I have served in this place, I owe so much to the legion of friends and supporters who have worked so hard for us to be elected. I pay tribute to each and every one of them. But I would be lacking in true appreciation if I did not mention my campaign directors. I am lucky to have been very close and dear friends with my first director, Mr Tim Walker MP, now deceased. He was followed by Les Semken and Michael Douglas. Fellows, I thank you for what you have all done and for your continuing friendship. I think it is remarkable that in nearly 30 years I have had only three campaign directors and only five electoral secretaries. I am glad for all of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the question I have been constantly asked since I decided long ago not to contest the next election I have answered&mdash;with your indulgence of course, Mr Speaker&mdash;`Bugger all'. I know it is not parliamentary, but it expresses what I am going to do. Of course, I shall still support&mdash;I know this may distress you, Mr Speaker&mdash;and go more often, I might add, to Cronulla Leagues Club, when we play Illawarra as well. I mention Southern District Rugby Union, my four wonderful surf clubs&mdash;Cronulla, Cronulla North, Elouera and Wanda&mdash;the Handicapped Children's Centre in Cook, the guides, the scouts and all the other countless organisations I have supported for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By far the most enjoyable task I have had while a member was being my party's representative on the New Parliament House Arts Advisory Committee. This was so stimulating and so enjoyable that it had to be regarded as obscene. But it was a great thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other committee I mention, after all the committees I have served on over the years&mdash;God knows I have served on a lot of them&mdash;is the environment committee under the chairmanship of Jeanette McHugh. Jeanette was an absolutely inspiring and wonderful committee chairperson. The times we spent together on that committee are times I shall remember for the rest of my life. I would like to think more people on this side of the House had that regard for people on that side of the House, and vice versa. Work on committees in this parliament is the place for real enjoyment and satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier in this speech, I hope we get away from this nonsense whereby committees are given the work allegedly by the parliament or by the minister. What happens with the committees then is that they become play toys almost, some of them, of that minister in particular. Luckily, I have served with Barry Jones on the long term strategies committee. Thank heavens for us that Bob Hawke, in giving him this committee, also gave him the right to choose his own subjects, and that has been a very stimulating time as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to get all the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), my leader (Mr Howard) and the leadership group. I have enjoyed it very much. As I said earlier, I liked the bad as well as the good. I shall miss a lot of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major thing I will miss is the camaraderie of the place. I have made some very good friends with the Comcar drivers and staff in the building&mdash;in fact, more among them than amongst members of my own party. In your own party there is competition. Whatever develops develops, and I think I shall go away from here with several friends who are not in the party and are not in the parliamentary process. They work in the building. We have heard all of the `insincerities', as we used to call them&mdash;not the valedictories. For years we had the insincerities, which is this time now. </PARA>

As Ben was so strong last time in saying that he was convinced his party was going to win, I am even more convinced that my party is going to win. I am even more convinced that my party is going to win well. Having been part of the 1966 push, which you made reference to, John, and also getting back in again in the 1975 push, I feel that the results of the elections in 1996 will be better than those in 1975. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the time of the next election, I will have been here for 25 years. In that time there have been 11 elections. I am the fourth longest serving member of the House of Representatives. There is Ian Sinclair, the grandfather of the House; the Prime Minister himself; Don Dobie, the member for Cook; and then me. I came in on a by-election in March 1971. That by-election had one interesting feature. The Liberal Party was contesting the by-election, as it was their right, and they changed prime ministers halfway through the by-election. So I had Mr Gorton open the by-election for the Liberal Party and Mr McMahon  close the by-election for the Liberal Party. Nevertheless, I managed to win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to my predecessor in Murray, Sir John `Black Jack' McEwen. I still believe he was a great Australian and has achieved more for Australia than anyone who has been in this parliament since he retired. There are some who portray him now as an arch protectionist. That is easy to say now, but if you are to be fair and compare him with his time&mdash;his contemporaries, both here and abroad&mdash;he was a very significant trade liberaliser. He implemented the Japan-Australia trade agreement in the late 1950s, against the opposition of the Labor Party and the RSL. He started off the CER process and NAFTA, against the opposition of the Labor Party and, I must say, some of the industries he represented as well. He was responsible for basically tariffying the Australian protection system in the 1960s, something that only now is happening for many countries with the Uruguay Round. If you read any of the speeches of that time by key people in the opposition, such as Mr Calwell or Clyde Cameron or Mr Daly, you will find that they consider he was a very dangerous free trader compared to what they thought was the appropriate level of protection at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very honoured to have been a member of federal parliament. In a democratic society, freely elected representatives are a special and, to me, a most important feature of society. The greatest honour in our democracy is to be elected to the federal parliament because it is the most senior elected position available in this country to a reasonable number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very privileged to represent the electorate of Murray with its wonderful people and its great agricultural strengths. It is the most significant, intensive irrigation-agricultural electorate in Australia. It is now being recognised by a second round of significant investment on farm, in factory and in food processing value adding. In fact, on a number of occasions recently there has been more manufacturing investment in my electorate than in just about the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many challenges to maintaining that productivity and value adding in the electorate, but that is recognised: water quality through high water tables; salinity and nutrients from increasing farm and food processing production. But there is a community commitment to achieve what is necessary, and this was recognised in the regional development statement in 1994 when my area was picked out as the one area of Australia to receive a significant grant in recognition of what is being done by the people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one of the saddest statistics of my time in parliament has been in recent years the declining comparative and, in many cases, real incomes of people in rural and regional Australia. All of the lowest income electorates are rural and regional electorates, and Murray is one of those. These electorates have to compete internationally; they are more exposed to the vagaries of international markets and the corruptions of them, et cetera, particularly from the European Union and, more recently, the United States, than are other electorates in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those problems, including our high domestic cost structure, need to be better recognised with special services and policies so that equity can be provided for those people, whether it is in welfare or education services or infrastructure. After saying that&mdash;I suppose pointing the finger somewhat critically at the Labor government&mdash;I do, however, commend the government for what has been achieved with the Uruguay Round and now with APEC because it does mean, hopefully, a more positive future for these electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also sad to me that there is now a lower standard in this House than there was when I came here 25 years ago. This is something that must be addressed because of the TV exposure which is now given to this parliament and the increasing number of school children that come here. I commend you, Mr Speaker, for what you are doing, and I recognise in particular the work of Harry Jenkins when he was the Speaker of this House. But I believe that the Speaker needs the confidence of the government of the day in that it will automatically back that Speaker when he or she makes a decision so that even-handed judgments are able to be made in this place for both sides of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the changes to the sitting arrangements have had some detrimental effects, including a weakening of the party committee system from what it was as I remember in earlier days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been many highlights, and some dramatic days as well. There was that unique joint sitting of the two houses of parliament in 1974. I was privileged to be one of the speakers at that time because I was the shadow minister for health and we were debating Medibank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most dramatic day by far&mdash;and I presume the most dramatic day, really, in the history of our federal parliament&mdash;was 11 November 1975. I was a participant because I was a shadow minister at that time. I believed then, as I believe now, that it was the correct decision on the part of the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most dramatic days for the National Party were during the Joh for Canberra campaign. That created a great deal of sadness&mdash;in particular, for John Howard, as the Leader of the Opposition at that time, and for Ian Sinclair, the member for New England, as the Leader of the National Party at that time. It split the coalition and lost us the 1987 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud to have been a member of the Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House for 11 years, from 1976 to 1987. That committee was disbanded when this building was opened. I am very pleased with the building that we have here as this parliament. There are not many weaknesses in it. I think the catering facilities and arrangements may be the weakest. Overall, I am very proud to have been associated with this whole building and its concept over that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I think of highlights, I also think of some of the personalities and, in particular, those who have had a great command of the English language. There are four members of parliament in that category whom I wish to refer to: Gough Whitlam, the member for Werriwa; Kim Beazley Sr, the member for Fremantle; Jim Killen, the member for Moreton; and Ian Sinclair, the member for New England. We have had some great speakers, and we do have some great speakers in this place at the present time&mdash;that is, those with a command of the English language&mdash;but I have not added any more names to that list of four at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another highlight has been the friendships formed particularly with colleagues in the Liberal Party, but also with those in the Labor Party. Friendships are formed not just within the party but across the parties. I will refer at this stage to some who are leaving as I am. Ray Braithwaite, with his wife, Mavis, has been in parliament with me for quite some time, as have Don Dobie, David Connolly and Ken Aldred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel equally about those Labor members who are leaving.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to recognise Michael Duffy. When you, Michael, were the communications minister and I was the shadow minister, I think we had some interesting times together. I do commend you for the work that you have done in relation to the Uruguay Round, and I also commend the Deputy Prime Minister, who is not here at the moment. In recent times, he has done some constructive work in relation to regional development. I would include all of those who are leaving as sincere and good friends, and I wish them well for the future. </PARA>

I will make a particular reference to the library, because I have had a passion to know as much about the common agricultural policy as anybody in Europe so I could always match them when they were out here or when I was over there. The library has provided me with a range of publications over the time, which has been very helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to recognise my office staff over that time&mdash;my current staff, including Sue Miller, Diane Bethell and Gayle Cykner; my previous staff, including Heather Bennett, Valerie Green, Beth Raleigh, Barbara Stossek, Shirley Smith and Annette Fischer; and some staff who were with me when I was a shadow minister, including Elaine Stangl, Steve Oxley, Sue (Carney) White, Margaret Wood and Bunty Evans, who has been such a good worker both for me and for the National and Liberal parties over a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do particularly want to thank the National Party. It is a privilege to be here in parliament, and the reality of modern politics is that the party system is the basis for a stable government and therefore the party is essential, generally speaking, to one's efforts to enter parliament. In my time, it has been the Country Party, the National Country Party and, I presume finally, the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly grateful for the opportunities that the party has given me&mdash;such as the positions of shadow minister for health, for communications, for transport and aviation and for primary industry; parliamentary secretary for primary industry for three years; and Deputy Leader of the National Party for six years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a party, we have been a united group on behalf of rural and regional Australia. I want to say very clearly that Tim Fischer, as our leader, has our loyal support. Tim will make a great Deputy Prime Minister after the next election. I want to also recognise our deputy leader, John Anderson, and our other shadow ministers who are making a most significant contribution. To John Howard, as the Leader of the Opposition, you are a great coalitionist. I remember achieving that coalition agreement for Victoria again after so many years when it had broken down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) for their very kind remarks. I am particularly pleased to follow Bruce Lloyd in this debate. He said that he was shadow minister for communications and he was a good shadow minister for communications. In those tumultuous days he actually understood the issues, which almost made him unique. He was also a very good representative for rural Australia during the period of the Uruguay Round, but he was never prepared to take political points in respect of those negotiations. I think it is one of the things which largely united this parliament. I always appreciated the very responsible attitude of the member for Murray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The period that we are referring to has been an extraordinary one. When I came here in 1980, as the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, we sat together. He mentioned John Armitage and the great advice that we got. Sitting near John Armitage in those days was somebody who did give advice of enormous significance, and that was Ralph Jacobi, who was then the member for Hawker. There was Barry Jones, also from Victoria, whom I had known for a long time; Brian Howe; and Clyde Holding, whom I campaigned with in the 1976 state election campaign. At the time one would have been disappointed, but delighted subsequently at having lost&mdash;not Clyde but myself, I mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there were a lot of people here that I knew when I came here. The present Prime Minister, Paul Keating, campaigned in Holt in 1977 with Jim McClelland. There was a common link with people like Ben Humphreys through Lionel Bowen who campaigned there in 1977 and was an enormous help to me from the very first day that I came here and remains a very close friend to this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been privileged to be in this parliament in the period from 1980 to today because it was a great period for the Labor Party. We had that period in opposition from October 1980 to March 1983, which was not very long when you look at how many years some of our colleagues have spent in opposition. I will always be grateful to those who were responsible, and a lot of people were responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that took place between 1977 and 1980 under the leadership of Bill Hayden should not be forgotten. That was when a lot of thought was given to policy and a lot of changes took place. That should be remembered. We had the change in leadership before the 1983 election, as you recall, in dramatic circumstances and we came to government. I think that period brought about change that only the Labor Party could bring about because we were driven by two people at that stage of extraordinary stature within the party in Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People do not quite appreciate sometimes now, because of what has gone on in the more recent past, what a combination the Treasurer in Paul Keating and the Prime Minister in Bob Hawke was. It was an extraordinary combination driving for reform. I think Brian Howe mentioned earlier today the difference in styles&mdash;the corporate style of Bob Hawke and the more spectacular driving style of Paul as Treasurer and subsequently as Prime Minister. They were both great leaders of this party and one still is and maybe for a long while in the future I hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a great honour to have served in those two governments. It has been a great caucus. We have been extremely well served by the quality of people who have been in the Labor Party in that period. When you look around this caucus now they are still there. It is true what Ben Humphreys says. There are plenty of people to come up, and I think we have to look at the future and make sure that continues. That is something the party has done very well. Whether it will continue to do so in the future is another matter. I might touch on that briefly a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through that period I think the achievements were enormous. They were not easy though. I understand the sentiments of the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). The view opposite has tended to be for a long while that the next election would be it&mdash;not necessarily. This government has never been popular. It has never been popular because it drove reforms and it had to do a lot of things which did not go down too easily with some people on this side of the House and that includes me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of reforms came forward, particularly in the early days of Bob Hawke's prime ministership and the treasurership of Paul Keating, which we did not particularly like, but they were correct, by and large. They did have an effect in the community. Restructuring is not easy. If you come from an electorate such as Holt, you would know the difficulties that were caused in that area&mdash;the change in the industrial base. But it is changing now. You can now see the long-term planning that was there under the leadership of those two great Prime Ministers that we have had in this parliament. </PARA>

The next one is going to be tough. Whether we come back again&mdash;maybe we will and maybe we will not&mdash;when we leave here you can all be guaranteed it is going to be a hell of a fight.

Brian Howe mentioned the Milo club, which was a mixture of people but it was really led by Lionel Bowen, who was a great raconteur. He never ever let facts interfere with a good story. Over a period of time if you heard them over an over you wondered whether it was the same story, but they were always good stories. There was a lot of Labor history there.

The Dickensian work conditions were appalling for people and we had to move on. But something did go wrong here with that camaraderie that did exist in the old Parliament House. Those gatherings were great gatherings. A lot of people used to wander into those. Mick Young used to be there sometimes. There were always people like Jacobi and Barry Jones. You had to be pretty quick to get a word in, but if you waited carefully you would. </PARA>

The Prime Minister mentioned something the other day at our caucus drinks which I remember very well. It is something that I think everyone ought to remember&mdash;that is, how tough government is. It is tough. I had not been a shadow minister because I came in in 1980 and the three people who went into the ministry were Kim Beazley, me and of course the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. </PARA>

I think that was how it was. Then we had those big changes to the philosophy of the party, big changes in every way. I think that period was tough, it was hard and it was really something which could have only come about because of the quality of the people who drove it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Howe touched on a couple of very interesting points, particularly about the cabinet. Funnily enough there were not a lot of people&mdash;it may be different now&mdash;in that cabinet who were very close friends. A lot of people were friends but they were not all that close. But when trouble arose they really did close ranks, and the discipline of that government was absolutely tremendous. It was something which I think held the government together over those very rocky periods. If you go back to the targeting of social security, means testing&mdash;all of those tough things&mdash;people ran around saying, `We're going to lose; we're doomed.' But the discipline held and the reforms took place and they benefited everyone in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kim Beazley was someone who came here with a big reputation which has never changed. He has that reputation today and it has been completely earned. That gives me a lot of confidence in the future. We have the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who is still a young man, comparatively speaking. We have Kim Beazley, Simon Crean and of course Gareth Evans coming down to the House of Representatives. It will take Gareth a while to hit his straps here, but when he does it will be a very formidable team for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always remember the great regard that Bob Hawke had for Beazley and the things he used to do for him. He wanted to get him out of Defence and move him to a financial portfolio. He took a long and fairly circuitous way to get there, but it eventually happened. Bob Hawke used to ask people to do extraordinary things. When I was Minister for Communications&mdash;it may have been to help Beazley or to distract me from communications, or a bit of both&mdash;he asked me to be Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. That was an extraordinary period, because it is probably the only time a minister in this government has gone on strike. </PARA>

Although he got his own back, I recall, with the visit of the Queen to Australia, when he made sure that I was the one who represented him at the naval base in Victoria on that day of 115 degrees in the shade. I think that he squared off for a lot of the indolence that was shown in that portfolio. But the move was really, Kim, to save this government from a lot worse, because Bob always had in mind that I might be the Minister for Defence! I thought I should at least be decent about it right from the start and indicate that I was not suitable. You were able to bear with that very well. </PARA>

Having seen a lot of the private sector, I think people had better start understanding very quickly that the public sector that has served this government matches it very well with the private sector. The public servants have been exceptionally good, by and large. They have to be pushed at times. You do not have to accept their views. I think that the sort of view that is around about the Public Service is quite absurd. There are people in the Public Service who, if they left tomorrow, would be earning a lot more money, and probably not working as hard, but they have a dedication to serve governments of both political persuasions. </PARA>

One was the first secretary that I worked with, Bob Lansdown. Another was one of the most outstanding public servants that I had the pleasure of working with, Peter Field. Peter Field played an absolutely outstanding role in the Uruguay Round and he was a very good friend. It was a pleasure to work with him through those very arduous performances, which were referred to earlier by the Prime Minister.

I thank those people in Holt who have continued to return me as the member for Holt from 1980 to today. That is a lot of elections. It was a very marginal electorate originally, now not so marginal&mdash;brought about by the representation, to a large extent, but also partly by demographic change. Interestingly enough, the boundaries of Holt are now very similar to what they were back in 1980, except that they do not include Berwick.

I am not referring to the clapped-out factory of General Motors that was not touched for so many years and was just getting worse and worse, but to other sorts of industries which are developing in the area. Of course, General Motors went to a proper factory in Altona. Whether they could have done something in Dandenong is another matter, because their contribution to the electorate of Holt was never huge. </PARA>

I do not want to dwell on that too much, except to say that if this government is defeated&mdash;and I, being one of the great pessimists, do not think that it will be!&mdash;it will be only the second election that I have thought we were going to win since 1980. It is an interesting prediction. It will be because of the fact that people are now starting to understand what this government has done&mdash;not readily, but it is now starting to show. </PARA>

One in a different category is Margaret Nolan, who was here but who, unfortunately, had to go back to Melbourne earlier. She has been on my staff for 13 years&mdash;which means that she is long-suffering as well as capable&mdash;and served both on the ministerial staff and in the electorate office.

At a recent social function I was talking to Lionel Bowen, and Claire Bowen was there&mdash;not a person who is normally very aggressive. She asked me what I was doing and I said what I was doing at least two days a week. She snapped at me, `What are you doing the other three?' I think there was a strong message in that. I certainly propose to be very careful about it. </PARA>

I was then elected to be the first woman from Western Australia in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new house that I bought was a very modest, small home in the hills outside of Perth. The electorate of Canning, which was my first electorate, was quite large; I thought it was enormous. I decided that I would choose a modest place in the centre of that electorate. I actually did get a map out and say `there'. I remember hunting in the advertisements in the newspapers to see where I could find a small place, and I eventually did. I was very proud of my new home. It was only about one week after I had actually signed on the dotted line that I realised I had bought a home five doors from the sitting member, who was a member of the Liberal Party, whom I went on to defeat. When the Commonwealth car drivers used to come to collect me later, they could not believe that I was actually the member&mdash;they kept on asking me where the boss was each time I came out with a suitcase&mdash;and only down the road from the gentleman who had represented the electorate for so many years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a long 13 years, during which my house has moved further and further from the centre of my electorate, as successive redistributions transformed me from being the member for Canning to the member for Brand. I now live in the electorate of Pearce. Judy Moylan, who is sitting opposite, is my federal member. It is probably not known by anyone in this House that Pearce was named after my grandfather's brother. Although I do not often talk about that, he actually began his career in the Labor Party but switched sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had plenty of time to get over my fear of flying all the way from Western Australia, although on a few occasions I felt sure that my constituents were going to be forced into a by-election by a down draught or a thunderstorm over Black Mountain as we have flown here to Canberra. People who live in the eastern states of Australia often forget how far we are away in Perth. If I need to get to a meeting at 2 o'clock on a Monday in Canberra, I have to leave my home at about 10 o'clock the morning before to get to the airport and get across here for that. Crossing the desert from between two to four times a week for months on end, year after year is enough to make staying in one place seem like a very attractive proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been an exciting 13 years. I have worked with two of the best prime ministers this country has ever seen, and I thank both for their support and encouragement over the years. I have had as colleagues on the front and back benches some of the best and most talented political people with whom it has been a pleasure and privilege to work. Like many of us who are retiring at the next election, I have seen the Australian parliament make the transition into the new Parliament House&mdash;a move which took us from 19th century working conditions into one of the most splendid working environments in the world. My colleagues have mentioned the Milo club. I too remember those clubs and the way in which if the parliament was sitting late at night we were able to mingle together and talk and share stories about political life and our life outside politics. I think it is rather sad that that does not happen in this place. I believe that this is truly a building of which all Australians can be proud and to have actually participated in the first parliamentary sessions here has been an honour indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues have ably detailed the social and economic achievements of the government for the last 13 years. I want to put on record my particular interest in just two of these. The first belongs to the early days of my career in this place and the second is the project to which I have devoted a substantial part of the last three years. As a former hospital based and community nurse, I brought to this place a special concern for the nursing profession. That I played a part in effecting the transfer of nurse education into the tertiary sector will always be a source of pleasure and satisfaction to me. I remember after the decision was made taking some of the senior members of the profession to the airport. One of them was saying to me that she was so happy she could not stop smiling, and I knew exactly how she felt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second achievement in which I played a part was the release earlier this year of the report on the management and treatment of breast cancer by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. This report was significant to me, both professionally and personally. My family lost a very dear friend early in 1994, so I knew directly something of the ravages that breast cancer brings to so many Australian women and their families and friends. I firmly believe that this report might serve as a catalyst for devising ways of managing and treating breast cancer, which both better reflect the high skill levels of our medical practitioners and produce better outcomes for those whom breast cancer affects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful to my colleagues on that subcommittee for all the work they did. I think we went through 1,077 pages of written submissions. Don Dobie was talking of the work of the committees in this place. Just reflecting on the particular work of that committee and the way in which the medical profession has responded to what a parliamentary committee has recommended indicates the significance and importance of committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other people without whom I could not have survived my 13 years. My electorate staff who shared the good times and stoically tolerated me during the not so good deserve special mention. Particular mention must be made to Fran Harman, who was my electorate secretary for over 11 years. My ministerial staff also have my sincere gratitude. I particularly acknowledge Craddock Morton, whose wisdom and firm direction kept our show on the road. The officers and staff here in Parliament House have helped me in innumerable ways over the years. To everyone&mdash;from the attendants to the dining room staff&mdash;I say thank you for having made the last 13 years run so smoothly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make special mention of the Commonwealth drivers, particularly John Davis, who drove me here in Canberra, and Mal Holmes in Perth, whose homemade winemaking is surpassed only by his ability to avoid collisions with out of control semi-trailers. Another story exists there about a by-election that was about to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I must express my gratitude to the Australian Labor Party, particularly the Left faction of the Australian Labor Party. The support of people like John Cowdell, who has come through the whole 13 years with me, has been invaluable. I leave the parliament as committed to the ALP as when I first joined in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that I am handing the electorate of Brand over to Kim Beazley is a mark of the continuing commitment of the ALP to give the very best to the people of rural and regional Australia. Kim will fulfil all the expectations placed on him by people in the communities of Rockingham, Kwinana, Mandurah, Pinjarra, Harvey and Collie. I commend him wholeheartedly to the electors of Brand. There will only be one thing that Kim will not be able to do in Brand that I was able to do&mdash;that is, represent the town in which he was born. I was born in a little town called Harvey. It was really quite extraordinary that I should eventually find my way into federal parliament to represent the people of the town of Harvey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now at the age of 54 I turn my thoughts to the future with enormous optimism. My home is filled with human and non-human replacements for Bill the duck and Malcolm the cat. Going home means I can spend more time with my best friends and my garden&mdash;and, of course, with my son and grandson and my daughter-in-law, and also my mother. My father did not live long enough to see me go into the ministry, unfortunately. He was very proud of his daughter Wendy and I wished he had been able to see me become a minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My mother, who has been the mother of a federal politician for 13 years, has at times wondered why we stay in this place. But I think she too has been very proud. I have been very proud of her as she has stood beside me. The cliche says that there are no friends in politics. My 13 years shows that, like most cliches, this only applies at the most superficial level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the other parliamentary leaders for their kind remarks. Many years ago I asked Bill McMahon why he stayed in parliament so long following his prime ministership. He replied that no-one could appreciate his sense of shame at being the first Liberal Prime Minister to lose an election, although of course he wasn't the last. By remaining in parliament he apparently felt that he could in some way expurgate the ghosts of the past. Having recently entered the Liberal Party's pantheon of martyrs as the first shadow minister to lose preselection to a long-time member of the Labor Party who claimed that he had never voted Liberal in his life, I can in a sense understand how Bill McMahon felt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an inevitable reality of politics that very few members of this parliament are given the opportunity to choose the manner and timing of their departure. I won preselection back in 1973, the same time that John Howard won his. Mine was a field of 32, which was probably the strongest field of candidates that the party has ever seen. Of the final six, five went into federal or state politics and three subsequently went to the bench. It is sad, in my view, that the people of Bradfield have not had the opportunity to choose from a similar field as was available back in 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I arrived in 1974, the average life expectancy of a member was around 11 years. It has now fallen to eight. If the community's attitude towards the political process and to parliamentarians in particular does not change, it is reasonable to assume that the average period in parliament may fall even further. A recent University of Sydney study has found that the typical Australian adolescent has no interest in politics whatsoever. Regrettably, therefore, the tendency seems to be that people are turning away from the political process. They are not joining political parties. I believe this is a most serious issue because it goes to the very heart of our process of government. So my parting advice to all of you has to be: you must lift your game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first arrived on the parliamentary scene in 1963 as an uncouth 23-year-old appointed as private secretary to the President of the Senate, Sir Alister McMullin. That was not my first introduction to politics as I had previously served for three years as a state research officer in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party under Sir John Carrick. In fact, when I started on that sojourn I was too young to vote. I can probably claim that, with the exception of Ian Sinclair&mdash;and this includes Don Dobie&mdash;no other coalition member in this House would have had first-hand experience of every Prime Minister since and including Sir Robert Menzies. I remember travelling with Ian when he came to Canberra&mdash;in fact, the day he took his seat in the House as the new member for New England. To me he has always remained the epitome of an effective minister and an outstanding parliamentarian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a tendency for people making their final addresses in this place to dwell on the past. While there is a certain inevitability about that, I do remain committed to the future.

If they do not do so they will be condemned to repeat the errors of the past.</PARA>

I have always tried to be a good local member and I am concerned that there is a tendency in the media to discount the significance of that role. It is perfectly possible to be a good local member, a good parliamentarian, a good initiator of policy and, if needs be, a good minister.

I said, `Bill, I don't think that's a very good idea. That's a place to keep away from.' But, oh no, he had to go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that same period, I was chairman of the Fraser government's foreign affairs and defence committee and served on the joint standing committee of the parliament where I initiated the first review of Australia's relations with Indonesia. During the Hawke government I had the opportunity to return to the diplomatic service but being a shadow minister I felt it was my responsibility to support the party which had given me the chance to serve in parliament and to do what I could to get it into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although never a minister, I probably share with my colleague and friend John Howard the record for service on the front bench in opposition. In all, I have held eight shadow portfolios and was chairman or deputy chairman of five parliamentary committees. The breadth of that experience gave me the opportunity to contribute to policy development in a range of fields, including the environment, Aboriginal affairs and social security. My greatest passion is and remains to develop a comprehensive and effective retirement income policy for all Australians. I thank John Howard for his earlier remarks on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1981 I raised with Prime Minister Fraser the serious implications for Australia of an ageing population. I urged him to establish a bipartisan parliamentary committee to review this critical area of policy. I believed then, as I still do, that the broad parameters of such policy must have a bipartisan base because no politician has the right to constantly change the rules of the game when they are dealing with the savings and the future of all Australians, especially those who often are our most vulnerable citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister on that occasion did not agree with my proposal but he established a task force which I chaired, with Ray Braithwaite as one of its members. We examined all the major reports on the subject and we submitted recommended policy. Unfortunately, no sooner had we completed our preliminary report prior to the March 1983 election than the government changed and Treasurer Keating announced the Hawke government's policy in June the same year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with public administration reform, I have been immensely gratified to see that over the years many of my ideas have been incorporated in Labor government policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is bipartisan support for the significance of APEC as a major cornerstone of Australia's foreign and trade policies well into the 21st century. It is only appropriate that I should compliment both prime ministers Hawke and Keating for the role they played in its development. APEC was an idea whose time had come. It represented a normal evolutionary process through which like-minded states pass in their desire to build a new cooperative future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To further advance the cause of regional cooperation and to ensure that in future Australia is surrounded by nations which share our common democratic ideals, which I firmly believe is our best security, I recommended to the parliament in 1990 that we start developing a new regional parliamentary body which would support the aims of APEC. Just as the heads of state meet annually at the apex of that organisation, I saw the representatives of the peoples of the Asia-Pacific as its foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience of other multinational organisations, such as the Council of Europe, the NATO assembly and now the European parliament, demonstrates conclusively that, while international cooperation based upon executive decision making is always important, in the furtherance of the democratic ideal and the need to establish a consensus at the community level it is absolutely essential that the representatives of the people be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 I met with Japanese parliamentarians in Tokyo headed by the former Prime Minister Mr Nakasone. We shared a similar vision and I was asked to prepare a discussion paper which was considered at an informal regional meeting in Singapore the following year. That meeting was attended by representatives from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the Philippines and Singapore. My recommendations were largely accepted and the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum was officially launched at the first conference held in Tokyo in January 1993. Subsequently in 1994, at the Manila meeting, draft standing orders, which I also initiated, were accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to place on record the fact that, although I was a member of the opposition, I had the support of Prime Minister Hawke, Foreign Minister Evans and, of course, my own leadership, as well as Speakers McLeay and Martin, both of whom also played&mdash;and the latter is certainly still playing&mdash;a most important role in the development of this new regional assembly of 25 member parliaments. I must also note the outstanding contribution made to the APPF by our clerk Lyn Barlin, whose wise counsel was often the difference between success and failure in those very sensitive negotiations in which we were involved in those earlier years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of developing a formal link between the APPF and APEC is still not complete. I hope that at the next APEC meeting in the Philippines the question of widening the political base of the organisation will be a serious issue. This has been recognised by none other than President Ramos, who will chair that meeting. In his statement to the APPF Manila meeting he said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reflect briefly on my efforts to establish a strategy which I believe, if it had been faithfully adhered to, could have won us government in 1993. Australia emerged from the 1990 election with a very cynical electorate. Sadly, nothing much has changed. In my view it was essential at that stage for the coalition to win back the confidence of the community. To that end, I proposed a three-phase strategy called `Australia 2000'. It involved parliamentarians listening to the Australian people, something too many people believe we do not do. In the second year, community views were to be analysed, policy options developed and discussion papers released. Finally, having ironed out the problems and tested the water, the final policy would be ready for the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues and I developed a dialogue with over a quarter of a million people from all walks of life and from virtually every interest group in the country, including the trade unions. We published a report prepared for us by Hugh Mackay called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australians speak</EMPHASIS>. But, sadly, instead of testing our more radical policies, it was decided to dispense with phase 2 and go straight to the launch of Fightback. The rest is history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last May my political career came to an abrupt end. I could have shut up shop and walked away. I did not because I had a responsibility to the people of Bradfield, to my parliamentary colleagues and to the party which has a political philosophy which I have supported all my adult life. Anything less than my total support for my leader, John Howard, at this stage would have been churlish in the extreme. Consequently, when I was asked to remain as coalition spokesman on superannuation and retirement income through to election day I accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I made the point that we are the servants, not the masters, of the Australian people. One of my greatest pleasures in politics has been the opportunity to work with and to help so many fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My wife and I have been deeply touched since last May up to the present by the deluge of hundreds of letters with expressions of support from my constituents and from people right across Australia. I have never sought a high profile beyond my responsibilities to the parliament and to the party, because often a high profile, especially in opposition, means you are a squeaky wheel. Yet it was gratifying to realise that my efforts were appreciated by so many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were asked what was my most satisfying experience in politics, I would say without equivocation it was my `Youthwork' program to help young unemployed. Between 1979 and 1983 youth unemployment became a serious social issue and, sadly, it still is to this day. I set out to prove that one of the solutions was to identify the job opportunities which are found in every community and make them available to our youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Youthwork' was a triumph over a reactionary bureaucracy at that time which refused to accept that members of parliament may on occasions have a good idea. We trained over 320 young people, and we found work for over 75 per cent of them. Most came from the western suburbs of Sydney. We bussed them to the North Shore to ensure that they had a fair go. Government schemes at the same time had a success rate of about 30 per cent. This was the first work for benefit program ever successfully launched in Australia. I am pleased to see that various hybrids have been developed since. From time to time, I still meet some of the graduates of that program and I realise how much we can do to help each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is now a serious issue for more than just the youth of Australia. It is also a problem for the middle aged and those who have been caught up in the brunt of industrial restructuring. These changes will continue to blur the archaic distinction between employment and unemployment which we have taken for granted for too long and which has dominated our policy perceptions. Our social welfare programs must be restructured to recognise this new reality. That is why one of the issues I have carried so strongly in this House is the removal of age discrimination. You cannot define a person by accident of birth. You define them by the contribution that they can make to society, and no other rules should be applied. </PARA>

Without your help, I could never have endured this long journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few people realise the pressures of public life and the sacrifices which our spouses and children have to make in the service of a nation which is not always forthcoming in either praise or thanks. Without Monique's unswerving support and devotion I would not have survived. Being herself a foreigner more or less cast adrift in metropolitan Sydney with two young children, she did not have an easy life. Out of her experience, she established the International Women's Club in Sydney, which now has over 30 nationalities and directly helps people like her fit into Australian society. That is the aspect of multiculturalism which we hear so little about and which has been ignored for too long. It is fine to respect the cultures of others, but the important thing is to build bridges between them. In that area, we have far, far to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to note my dear friends Sir Asher Joel, Lloyd Waddy and John Quinn, whose dedicated support, wise counsel and constant friendship have been of great assistance to me over these years. No member of parliament is of any value without the services of the most dedicated staff. In this I have been thrice blest. I inherited from my predecessor, Harry Turner, Val Webb, the doyen of electoral secretaries. All her successors, particularly Sue de Brett, Leonie Newson and Sonya Gatfield, have given the people of Bradfield outstanding service. My research staff have all gone on to greater things. I watch their careers with interest, especially Steven Rares at the Sydney bar and Tracey Carpenter. My parliamentary staff, Jan Holmes and Catherine Bridges, are also with us today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election, as I have told my colleagues, I knew that I would have to say something. Uncertain of what I would do, I came with the thought that John Kerin had described me in this House as `Sugar Ray'.

Thankfully, that did not come about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a proud moment for me to stand here as a oncer of 1975 and be able to opt for voluntary retirement. I note that another 1975 oncer, Ken Aldred, is here with me at the giving of these valedictories. The remaining one after this next election&mdash;I am sure that he will remain&mdash;will be John Moore. John Moore will be the only continuing oncer of 1975. We have heard a lot of valedictory speeches today. In 1975, we had 36 new members, 35 of whom were in the coalition. We were in and out of the House like yoyos as maiden speeches were presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is 20 years since I gave my maiden speech on the address-in-reply, seconding that motion, on 18 February 1976. I look back over that time and wonder where it all went. Moments of crisis have a tremendous habit of crowding in upon you and never ending. When you look back on 20 years of activity, you wonder where they did go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to be able to compare the life of this parliament then with what it is now. There is little resemblance in the characters who were there then and the characters who are here now. It was not as though I came in here on the basis that I did not trust Whitlam and believed that he should have been thrown out. Whitlam was respected as a politician. All politicians were respected at that time as people who spoke and saw the truth. Different philosophies did not alter that approach. Unfortunately, in 1995, going on to 1996, that same respect is not held by the public for the politicians who have been cleansed or otherwise through the media and the hype of the moment to arrive at where we are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some lighter moments. I recall, certainly in the old House, Jim Killen being one of the characters. On the day of the colour television affair, where two of our ministers had to resign, Jim Killen rang up a lot of backbench hopefuls&mdash;unfortunately, most of their names started with `C'&mdash;and said, `The Prime Minister wants to see you in the cabinet room at 10 o'clock.' About five people came into the cabinet room looking at each other and not saying anything to each other but all expecting to get the nod for the ministry. When Malcolm Fraser came in, he apparently said, `What are you all doing here?' They then all realised that they had been had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another lighter moment concerns the same Jim Killen ringing up Florence on behalf of the secretary of John Howard, saying, `I'd like you to come and have morning tea with me and we'll discuss the flat rate tax.' I understand that a very nice morning tea eventuated. However, it is the lighter moments that you can easily recall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a privilege to have served those 20 years and to have realised that you are part of history after being part of the Old House of Parliament. You know of the warmth, the fellowship and the comradeship that really existed in that place&mdash;a warm feeling&mdash;and then being part of the transition to this House. Whilst it is more professional, that same link does not apply across both sides of the houses and seldom in between. I think that is unfortunate. This House is going to last us for the next 200 years perhaps, and I think it is very important for that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also reflect on the conditions prevailing at the time of that transition. John Sullivan took me in hand on the first day in the new place and said, `I'll show you where it all is.' By the time he had shown me where it all was and he had left, I was lost. I never really did find my way around for another six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But today it is quite possible for a new member to know more about opposition members and new members of the government than their own fellow members, so improved are the processes and systems. As far as systems are concerned, we now have the television, the faxes and everything else. A secret of my retirement is that I want to go before I have to learn how to work a computer and the basics of computerisation. It is astounding to look at the mass of communications available to us now compared with what was available to us in the beginning. But, then again, I wonder whether or not we have really improved the system. Perhaps all that we do is jam up the press offices with a whole stack of press releases that nobody uses, except as recycled paper, if they are using the system in place in Parliament House at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By going back and rereading my maiden speech, I can reflect on my electorate and the problems it was experiencing at that time and compare that with my electorate today. When I delivered that speech, Dawson was an electorate of about 60,000 square kilometres with 26 one-lane bridges on the main national highway and phone calls were still manually connected and operated. Manually operated phone communication was the only source of information that bound the people of those communities. Of course, those people found the old system with the lines strung from tree to tree a massive problem, but it was a link. If the police are not watching, with the advent of the Bruce Highway, you can go by car through my electorate probably half an hour quicker now. Also, you can ring up anyone automatically on a local call. Those problems have been solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While you have not been instrumental in the solving of those problems, you still feel part of it&mdash;and the feeling is great. If the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) were here, I would tell him that my SBS service is still required as much as it was in 1975. If some of my colleagues would not mind, they might just pass that on to him. It is of interest to be able to compare my electorate as it was then with as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Bruce Lloyd has said, I believe that it is a matter of great pride for each one of us that we should sit here and represent the nation through our constituencies. I never realised it so much as in 1990 when I came back here with a 0.2 per cent margin and was able to take my seat on the front bench. I looked up into the gallery and saw some of my colleagues who had been part of that parliament beforehand; while they were close, they were not part of it. I do not think many of us realise that the seats we occupy are of tremendous prestige, tremendous importance. What we do with those seats and how we influence world affairs or national affairs from here is very important to those people outside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time that I have been here, like Bruce Lloyd, I have been proud to be a National Party member. I know we get a hell of a bagging in this corner&mdash;cockies' corner, and everything else&mdash;but I believe that in their own way those people who point at us are envious of the position that the National Party occupies in this House. That position is not one of holding the balance of power, but it is one of real pride of belonging to a party where the party asks very little of you except to represent it. I am talking about the bush; I am talking about the country; I am talking about rural industries where most of us feel comfortable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe that, if it were not for the influence of the National Party, the city would forget what is happening out there in the broadacres of Australia. I believe that the National Party, even in my term of parliament, has offered a lot to this parliament. I would just pay tribute&mdash;because he is a remaining member from those days&mdash;to Ian Sinclair for the manner in which he, above all others, reminds me so much of the past that has come into the present. I pay tribute to the manner in which he has represented in so many ways not only his constituency but also his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back those many years to 1976-77 when there was a tremendous downturn in the market of the beef industry. It was Ian Sinclair who provided the wherewithal to get the industry past that little gap after the spaying program. More importantly, after that, he introduced the IEDs. Despite what has been done by the government to the IEDs over all these years, I believe the most effective and personal thing that could have been done for the person on the land was to be able to provide out of their cash funds a deposit for the future, to which they could return in desperate times. I would say that, over the last five years, if that had been available in my electorate to the many people who were stricken by drought, it would have been a tremendous bonus. Ian Sinclair, I believe, has been a tremendous representative and, above all, epitomises what the National Party is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context I also pay tribute to fellow valedictorian&mdash;if there is such a word, but Hansard will pick me up if there is not&mdash;Bruce Lloyd. Bruce has been a chap with whom I have had a very close association. Of all the people in this House, I believe that he is the one who has not been able to achieve the natural heights to which he should have risen, and that was to a ministry within a government. He has always played bridesmaid to a ministry. I have never known anybody with such a keen and quick sense of humour and with such dedication to his constituency and the National Party. I pay tribute to Bruce and Ian Sinclair. </PARA>

Those of you with great margins will not appreciate this, but I do. I crossed the floor in 1978 because I did not believe in retrospectivity, and I believed that the legislation on the Gorton case was a case of retrospectivity. I did not feel that good doing it, because Billy McMahon was one of the blokes with me, as were four Tasmanians. We were over here on this side. It was a very lonesome feeling, but my conscience was okay. To any of you who are backbenchers in government, who are aspiring to be ministers, I suggest that you do not cross the floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another not so pleasant time was the march of the miners in 1981 and 1982 over the housing tax issue. Bear in mind that the richest coal bearing deposit in Australia, the Bowen Basin, in my area had many mines and townships. I actually had a march on me by miners to my office at Moranbah. But what I remember about the miners' situation is that the miners had John Howard and Doug Anthony up to talk to a meeting, and Bob Katter was the local member. Bob always arrived late and left early. He flew in late, and many people were inside the hall and all the miners were outside. As Bob was shrugging off these people who were hitting him on the back and telling him to `get in there and tell them what to do, Bob' and everything else, he walked in and then wanted to leave. So he said, `Mr Chairman, I want to address the meeting.' The chairman was a miner. Bob spoke for 20 minutes, said goodbye and grabbed for his hat, and just as he got to the door the chairman said, `Bob, but will you tell us before you go are you with us or against us?' and Bob said `Yes, that's right'&mdash;and off he went. He was one of the real characters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that situation. You do not have a march by miners every day of the week. The Joh for Canberra campaign, which has already been referred to, was a testing time. It put the steel into politicians of any calibre. I can recall very vividly the Hervey Bay meeting of the National Party, the management meeting, the central council meeting, and the endorsement of the candidates, which was a very trying time. It set friend against friend, not only within the party in Queensland but more particularly, I am afraid, among my colleagues in New South Wales and Victoria. As that event unfolded back here, I can recall that we used to go into the party room with umbrellas. There were so many leaks that we would have been saturated had we not done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign was a very distressing time. `Joh for PM' was the theme. It was on that occasion that somebody said: `Joh, we are prepared to offer you the olive branch, but we are not going to offer you the whole damn tree.' That was about it. The campaign tested the National Party to a great extent. That was the one time we sat here separated in opposition. I feel that the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would admit that on those occasions every member of the National Party had a jersey. We had to mirror the legislation coming through. Although the campaign was built out of diversity, I believe that it was a great time to test the party. </PARA>

Bruce Lloyd and Ian McLachlan worked together to make sure that the policies that we took into the election, while they were faithfully covered, gave the opposition the best sugar policy that could have been offered in Australia. It was a very generous policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put to rest the myth that both those people were not involved and perhaps acted contrary to what was happening. If it had not been for those two, Bruce Lloyd and Ian McLachlan&mdash;and I understand that Ian McLachlan is hospitalised at the moment&mdash;and their sugar policy, we would not have returned Dawson and we would not have taken two seats from Labor. It is interesting looking at the years and their dire tough spots. There is a glimmer of hope amongst them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address some of my fellow valedictorians, and will echo something that Don Dobie said. In this parliamentary arrangement, contact with the other side of the House is only by way of committees. That is a great pity. The fellowships that I have with the Labor Party, with some exclusions, have been built up mainly through some mutual interest that we have had on committees. I mention Peter Staples. Although we were opposite each other in that aged care situation and never saw eye to eye that much, I have to say that you are a great bloke. We enjoyed our United Nations trip, and I thank the members of the coalition for electing me for that trip. Thank you very much, Peter. You and your wife, Ruth, were great company. Mavis and I certainly appreciated it.</PARA>

I have never found two nicer people to work with than Ben Humphreys and Russ Gorman from the Public Works Committee&mdash;even in spite of the chairman, who had unreal expectations of us. They are great blokes. Ben is a fellow Queenslander, so you would expect nothing less from him. Thank you very much. You were both great. Thank you, David, for your assistance on the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. I also thank the Speaker of the House, Steve Martin. These were friendships built up in many ways. I am not saying that we were without friends. Leo, I remember you in connection with the old finance committee.

We both believe that it should have been picked up in the 1940s, not in the 1980s. Don, I recognise that we shared a common client view when you were in the bank in Mackay.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Steele Hall and I have also been fairly close on a banking committee. Although at times he seemed to flow against the current of popular thinking within the party, he was always prepared to express his opinion honestly, clearly and without any fear of what might have been the ramifications. His leaving will be a loss to this parliament. I have already paid tribute to Bruce Lloyd. He is a great bloke. I have travelled overseas constantly with him and his wife, Heather. It has really been great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never spoken in a pre-Christmas valedictory before. On this occasion, after 20 years experience, I want to pay tribute to the Presiding Officer, Steve Martin. Steve and I share a position on the rugby league parliamentary support group. I want to leave him with the message that, although I am vice-president of the group, I will not be available for the next round. I would like to leave him with the thought that in the last State of Origin series, Queensland won all three games. The situation between the ARL and Super League is in dispute at the moment. Perhaps that will settle down. This is also the year in which the Queensland Bulls won the Sheffield Shield for the first time ever, so it has been a pretty important year. </PARA>

We all believe that she is a special friend of ours, but I think she is everybody's friend. I want to pay tribute to Marie for her acquaintance over many years. It has been really great. Phil Bergin was also active on a committee with me, and has always been helpful in the position he currently holds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of impartiality and independence in this House is the clerks who serve us. All of us believe that they work for us personally and show no favour whatsoever. I am speaking of all the clerks since I have been here, but more specifically to Lyn and Ian who are here now. I thank you. I could not have asked for two better participants in my valedictory. They have been of great help to me in the drafting of bills and amendments. I just want to mention that my private member's bill relating to the disability act turned out to be a fair reflection of what was required. Peter Staples will remember the legislation on residents' rights fairly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I know, this is the first occasion on which we actually put into legislation what is known as an amendable resolution in connection with residents' rights. Instead of a motion coming into the House and being either accepted or rejected, the motion could be amended and you could discuss it and then go on. The clerks helped me with that. More recently, they have helped me on the subcontractor issue. I hope that will be left with the parliament and that both sides of the incoming parliament will see if there can be a correction to the current situation. Lyn and Ian, thank you very much. I thank you and your team for showing that independence that we expect in a parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of independence, I want to say how important it is that we choose a speaker who is truly independent. On only one occasion in all my time here have I felt that the person in the chair has been truly independent of the party that elects them to that office. I refer to Clarrie Millar, and I was a bit concerned that Bruce Lloyd did not mention him when he spoke about the people who knew about English. Clarrie Millar knew English all right, but, the way he spoke it, none of us could understand it. Clarrie Millar was a true independent. When he was in the chair he was independent of the party that elected him. On one occasion he refused the Prime Minister indulgence to add to an answer to a question. Ian Sinclair will testify to this. It took him half an hour to unwind dissent from the standing orders so that the Prime Minister could give the extension to the answer. That is true independence. The position of the speaker is very much like that of a teacher: if the teacher is not going to insist on discipline, the House will not be disciplined. When Clarrie Millar sat in that chair he knew how to calm a situation. People knew that, when he spoke, he spoke not only with authority but with determination. If anybody wanted to offend him, they would be out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that, when the coalition comes into government next time, the person who is elected to the chair is given that same right of independence so that the situation in the House will reflect the people's wishes better than we do at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to Hansard. I am very happy that the Chief Hansard Reporter, Bernie Harris, is here too. While we talk about independence and about the gentlemen of the parliament, being the clerks, I believe the Hansard reporters are the quiet achievers. All of us can benefit&mdash;all of us have benefited&mdash;from the wordsmanship that these people use so that we can distribute our speeches to the public as fine English and fine interpretations of what we have said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I knew one of the Hansard people very well. That was Colin Lamb. His wordsmanship was of great merit. On occasions, in some difficult times he used to send me little clippings from Henry V about St Crispin's Day, saying, `If you fight the good fight with all your might, even though you lose, you will be respected tomorrow.' He was a great companion. I know that Hansard consists of a lot of Colin Lambs working for perfection, working in the best interests of this parliament and making a presentation that is worthy of the federal parliament. Over the time that I have been here television monitors, electronics and so on have been introduced. It has been a great job, Bernie, and I hope you express to all those Colin Lambs in your department my appreciation&mdash;and I think this parliament's appreciation&mdash;of what you have done. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to my children&mdash;three boys. I do not have a hope or an ambition for it, but I believe that one or two of my three children might follow in my parliamentary footsteps. I assure you it will be on the conservative side&mdash;for the National Party. At the last election we had a real team effort. My eldest son, Ian, was handing out how-to-vote cards and manning a polling booth for Bob Katter; another son, Robert, was in Leichhardt, knocking on doors and handing out how-to-vote cards there; and Scott, my second son, was in my office trying to unravel the mysteries of the GST that were assigned to him. If we had won the last election, I still reckon I could have got him a job selling the GST anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My sons have been particularly supportive. The public schools&mdash;not like the experience of some others&mdash;have been very kind to my lads, who have suffered no mischief in that regard. They have been terribly supportive. One of them said I should have got out in the `Joh for Canberra' campaign era. He said I should have called it quits then, and I am not sure that I should not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to my wider family. My father died in 1964. He was a veteran from the First World War. He tried to get me interested in politics in about 1961-62, when there was an election when Sir Charles Davidson was pulling out. I did not think the opportunity was there then, but the opportunity knocked a second time. I am sure that Dad would have loved to have known of the involvement that I have had in federal politics. I am just sorry that he was not able to be here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My mother is still alive, at 95. In her own quiet, supportive way, she has meant a great deal to me and to the whole family. It might give her too some satisfaction that I will retire and be out of what might be called the rat-race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mavis's own parents have been great. They used to serve on the booths for me over many years. In recent years her father has not been able to so do, but he is always a keen advocate and looks very closely at what is happening. Unfortunately, her mother died two elections ago, just on election eve. I mention my brothers and sisters, wherever they were. We have been able to identify only one who would vote Labor in the whole group, and they have been very closely watched. There has been a tremendous supportive attitude all around. Mavis, thank you very much. Thank you for the family and thank you for 20 years that I have really enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to my present staff. Rosalie McIlvenna has been with me in one way or another since 1962, first in the public accounting practice of G.E. Jones and Co. Then she came over unexpectedly to be my secretary. She has been with me for the full 20 years. She has been a great help and I really do not know what I am going to do without her. In fact, I think I will have to employ her in some fashion or other so that she can do the filing and pull this or that out. The others are John Mallett, Anne Agius and Margaret Allen. They are the people who currently work within my office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous employees, both down here in my shadow ministry capacity and in the office, have been Michelle Camilleri, Carol Lamb&mdash;Colin's wife&mdash;and Chris Fryer, whom I see in the advisers' box also. I am sure that Chris's mind goes back to the challenging times he thrust me into from the point of view that we did affect the Labor decision. The Milan posting did not go to the person who was selected by J.J. Brown. It went to another. I think we got to within an ace of causing a dismissal there. But it was positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really think we stopped the depopulisation of Christmas Island. You might recall that J.J.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few things still undone, but if you have not done them in 20 years, what can you expect? I refer to just three items.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the taxation system is a wretched mess. The great grief of the 1993 election was that GST was not introduced as a mechanism by which Australian companies could trade overseas competitively. I have asked that question, as the chairman of the committee knows, on all occasions and the answer has always come back that to trade competitively overseas you need a system that is not so intrusive as the sales tax we have at the moment. I believe there should be some alteration to that taxation system to improve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Reserve Bank should be truly independent. I do not believe it has been. It should be truly independent and it should be charged with not only issuing licences for the banking but also reviewing and revoking those licences if the banks do not measure up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say on this final occasion that the result of that bank inquiry is persevering. The problems in the banking industry are coming up day by day.

If you arrived here after 6 o'clock at night, you could not even get a cup of coffee in the place. The Sydney and Melbourne buildings were about the only ones that really existed. There was a building here&mdash;and it still stands; it is an old fibro building over on the back blocks towards the Labor Party house&mdash;and you could get bed and breakfast there for 1s 6d. You got two sausages and two potatoes, and a bed with two blankets&mdash;no sheets. You paid five shillings a night for overnight accommodation. You could have a couple of pints of beer and your bed and breakfast, and then you came out square. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next introduction to Canberra was when John Armitage was the member.

Of course, to excite the pot a little, you would have to say, `The Left are on the move.' Then he would say, `What have you heard? Where have you heard it? Who told you?' I would say, `I can't tell you, otherwise the information won't come back to me.' He would say, `You're a rat. Why won't you tell me who said it? I could get square with them.'

He would say, `Now, Russ, will you tell me who it was who told you the Left were on the move?' I would say, `I refuse to tell you. There is no way.' When he would come home on a weekend he would tell me how good it was being in Canberra. He managed this and he managed that; he spoke on this and he spoke on that.

When I came out of the briefing about two hours later, there was a fine on the front of my window. I thought, `I am a member of parliament and I get fined for parking around Parliament House!'

But when you got the minister there, very few turned up. The ones that did turn up were very active in their questioning and kept Ben right on the mark. Ben, I thank you very much for that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, every time I have been lucky enough to get a question&mdash;that has been with the courtesy of Leo and company&mdash;you have given me the call. I have been as nervous on those occasions as I am now, but you have always given me the call, and I thank you very much for that. I also thank you for your personal cooperation and friendship on the trip to America when our families went with us. It was a terrific trip. You cooperated in allowing us a little bit of time off for other than duties&mdash;but I will play that very lightly. I thank you very much for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all of the staff of Parliament House&mdash;the car drivers, the attendants, the printers downstairs and the catering staff, both the ones prior to Spotless and Spotless itself. I suppose the job of catering will now go to the future caterers. I must thank them for their personal attention, service and cooperation on all occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one could say that the drivers were a separate group of people. They were always there to pick you up in the morning any time that you wanted to be picked up. They would take you home. When we were in the old building and the hours were unlimited, that was sometimes at ungodly hours, but the drivers were always there. It is all right to say that they got paid for it, but they were always there, always courteous and always drove you home and made sure that you got into your accommodation before they drove off. For that, I thank them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I have enjoyed is the work I have done in the committees. I have always thought that you didn't have to speak in here but that you could do your work in either the caucus or the committees. I serve on the Public Works Committee with Ray Braithwaite, Ben Humphreys and a few other members. Colin Hollis is the chairman, and I must say that he rules the place with an iron fist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that I will miss most of all as time goes on will be the Public Works Committee. On the trips away&mdash;and they were not trips as such, because they were really inspections&mdash;there was great friendliness amongst the committee members, and that also applied when we met in Canberra. I do not think there was one argument that was not surmounted. If I had known what I know now, I would have joined the committee in 1983, but I was not smart enough in those days and I have been the newest member of the lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very good committee. I thank Colin for his chairmanship. I thank the members one and all for their friendship and assistance. Whenever there was an argument, it was well explained. When I argued something and committee members proved that I was wrong, it was always very easy for them to convince me that I should go the other way. I think I have proved that over the time I was with the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other matters I would like to mention is that the next Labor Party candidate for the seat will be Mr Frank Mossfield. He will be coming down here next year. I will say this: if he does not win the seat, Roger and a couple of the others will be very lonely on that side of the House. We will win the election; there is no doubt in my mind about that, and I have got some money to put on it if anybody wants to come forward. We will win the election, and we will win it well whenever it is. It will be in the early part of the year, of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To Frank, I wish him the best of luck. I hope everybody will give him the same cooperation they have given me, as well as the same friendship and the same hand with the information that new members have got to have. There are a lot of things that happen here that you are not really aware of when you first come down. It is something that you have to be taught. I will say this: when I first came down, I was given just as much information from that side of the House as I was from this side. I think those on this side thought I was going to be an enemy and try to get everything&mdash;all the chairmanships and all the rest of it. But I was helped from both sides and, for that, I thank all the members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like everybody else, I will comment on my staff. Sandra Caldwell was with John Armitage and came over to me when I got here. I was lucky that she was well trained by John. Even though I reluctantly say it, I thank him for that. She has been a blessing to me. I do not think I would have been re-elected on two or three occasions if not for Sandra and the staff who managed the office, cleaned up all the complaints, answered all the mail and did everything that had to be done. That is what the staff are there for, I suppose. For that, I thank Sandra Caldwell, Christine Grgic and Effy Moulakis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, I thank my three daughters and my wife. My three daughters&mdash;Elizabeth, Sharon and Kathryn&mdash;have been a real concrete support to me right throughout the whole ordeal, and it has been an ordeal at times because, as most of you know, I have not enjoyed the best of health over the last two or three years and that is because of age. I am getting close to my use-by date, I think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my wife, Jenny, who I think is watching me on one of the cameras&mdash;she said if the camera was facing me she would be watching; if it was not facing me she would think I've talked too long: I am only hoping that she is watching&mdash;thank you very much for the support you have given me. I am going to enjoy retirement with you. I am shifting to a new location. I am building a house now at a place called Bargo, which is near Mittagong. I will be shifting into your electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should be shifting about Christmas Day. You can all come and help me move, not only that but you have to bring your own grog. I am on the Old Hume Highway. It is called Railside Avenue. If anybody turns off the main highway at Bargo and comes past and you want to call in and have a cup of tea or a glass of beer, I would be only too pleased to see you all. I do not think I will be coming down too often and I will not be joining the ex-members. I say again to my wife: thank you, Jenny, very much for your support. I know that we will be happy for many, many years to come. With that, thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you, members, for the courtesy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I give my best wishes to my colleague Russ Gorman. The Deputy Prime Minister and member for Swan (Mr Beazley) said some very kind words about me earlier in the day. It struck me, as someone has said recently, that it is a strange party we're in. I can recall when I first ran for the electorate of Maribyrnong most of my now colleagues were trying to talk me out of it. Indeed, one of my more prominent cabinet colleagues was also interested in running for Maribyrnong and he was putting a very persuasive view, or he thought persuasive view, that I should wait some time, that I had plenty of years ahead of me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I ran for the ministry I can recall having a meeting with the Prime Minister. When he called me on the phone I thought something did not seem quite right. He called me up to his room. I went in and he put his big cigar&mdash;this is Hawkie, of course&mdash;in the ashtray. His eyes were flitting around the room and he was not looking me right in the eye. It did not take me too long to get the feeling I might have been in for the chop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He explained to me in a way that only Hawkie can&mdash;he was sitting behind his desk&mdash;`Look, Alan, I've got Bob here, and I've got you here and I've got Simon here. All good blokes&mdash;all should be in the ministry.' I was just waiting for him to say you have youth on your side and you should wait a bit longer and I said, `If I may interrupt you there, Bob, just for a moment.' He was not really keen on being interrupted. I said to him, `I agree. You have Bob here and you have Griffo here and you have Simon here. But there is one difference.' He said, `What's that?' He was getting very aggressive by this stage. I said, `I'm the only one with the numbers. So if you're talking about who is going in and who is not you are wasting your time with me. You had better have a yarn to the other two.' He said, `Do you have any suggestions?' I said, `Why don't you bump one of the Left off?' At midnight that night there was a discussion between the Prime Minister and my colleagues in the Left. Everyone was accommodated and the Left got the next vacancy or something like that. It is an interesting thing: when you announce you are going everyone spends all their time telling you why you shouldn't. At every step of the way there is always someone trying to talk you out of going up the ladder. It is a very interesting party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not help thinking about what goes around comes around. I was looking over at the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) earlier on. As he knows&mdash;it is not well known&mdash;many years ago in my dissipated youth I worked as a labourer on his parents' property. We were brought up literally a kilometre or so away from each other. He knows a fair bit about my track record, as I know a bit about his. I suspect it has been mutual interest that has kept either of us from talking too much on that topic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I stepped down from the ministry some time ago I was wondering, given that people were very interested in the issue of small retail outlets of one description or another, whether the information I know Peter McGauran had would ever see the light of day. Now that I am getting out, I don't care any more. I did burn down the service station on the Princes Highway in Traralgon, Thackeray's service station, when I was a kid. I was going home, having a smoke. I was about eight. It was in the middle of summer. The fire started, and the old Thackeray service station went west. During the recent inquiry I thought someone would bring the matter up. They never did, notwithstanding the fact that the inquiry called for submissions from all around Australia. I thank my colleague Peter McGauran for that. What I know about him will remain a secret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other colleagues have done, I want to thank my family first and foremost: Shirley and my two daughters, Martine and Kristel. They have caused me a bit of grief over the years. They were commenting only yesterday that one of the great things about my getting out of parliament is that the phone calls alleging my being seen in various coffee lounges with gorgeous young blonde women will stop. That happened on many occasions over the years. My wife and partner at that stage, Shirley, would say, `I'll only be worried if someone rings up and says you were with a redhead.' They are gorgeous kids. Like most children in political families, they have copped the good and the bad over the years. They have grown up to be fine young women and are my closest friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of my staff: I call Rosa `Rosa the magnificent'. I think she is the best electorate secretary in the history of the federation. I know I am given to overstatement on some occasions, but there is more than a hint of truth in that. She has worked for many members on both sides of the parliament. Those who know Rosa would tend to endorse that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my other staff members, Gordon and Rachel, with a couple of hiccups, I have to say they have been tremendous contributors to the electorate of Maribyrnong. I take this opportunity to thank them and to wish Gordon a rapid recovery from his recent illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Maribyrnong: it is an extraordinary electorate. It is amazing that the time that I spent most time away from the electorate was the time I got the best electoral result. I do not know whether those two facts are linked. As colleagues will know, a minister is very rarely in the electorate. When I was a minister we got the second biggest swing to Labor at the last election. There is something in this business about not being too active in your electorate. I commend that in particular to my colleagues in the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some real characters in Maribyrnong. It is a very interesting part of Australia. It is very diverse in its socioeconomic make-up. We had real characters like Erol Chick. In the trade union movement we had Sean McNamara, who was a former scaffolding colleague of mine. We came back into contact again when he was in the trade union movement. That was a long time ago. He gave me tremendous support. I appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Caucus is a rambunctious outfit. When I first came into politics I had a strong view that you had to be fairly robust in your approach to politics. I have been. That was my style. I was very happy with that. One of the problems I found in caucus over time, particularly when I was doing factional negotiating work, was that I started to get to like some of my enemies. It is that phenomenon which has been a milestone along the way for Labor. As a party, we have achieved, primarily as a result of mutual friendship and mutual respect, a real ability to work through issues. To my knowledge, that has not been present in any previous Labor government, certainly not to the same extent. It was good old-fashioned friendships that were the secret ingredient or the one that was not widely acknowledged, whether in the cabinet context or in the wider context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers have said, we have been blessed with some extraordinary individuals. I was not particularly close to Hawkie when he was Prime Minister. Now that he has gone, I seem to be one of those always commenting on how good a Prime Minister he was. He was a very good Prime Minister. He is entitled to our ongoing respect for his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is one of the most interesting people and politicians that I have come across over the years&mdash;a truly extraordinary leader, and one to be cherished by the Australian community. I made comment about the member for Swan earlier. He is an adornment to this place, and someone with a tremendous future. There are other characters around the place, and I mentioned Senator Gareth Evans earlier. His record is really quite an extraordinary one. With my colleagues from Victoria&mdash;the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), Senator Robert Ray and others&mdash;I have had a tremendously interesting and good time: sometimes in dispute, but never with any degree of enmity with anyone that I have dealt with in the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first came to the electorate of Maribyrnong, we did not have a tertiary institution in the whole of the western region of Melbourne. I, together with some colleagues, Andrew Theophanous and Neil O'Keefe and others, determined on a campaign to establish the Victoria University of Technology. We were ultimately successful and it has really changed the place. If you did nothing else in politics, the opportunity of participating in those sorts of developments would make it all worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My staff were very surprised the other night. A lady by the name of Anna came with her 21-year-old daughter, Rena, to my office. They thought they would say some nice things before I left the parliament. This came to pass because, many years ago, this same lady came into my office with a very tiny girl with her. I will not go into the details, but the husband had been killed and there was no way they could gain any compensation. There were extraterritorial laws involved and it was a very complicated matter, and I had the opportunity of running what was a really fragile case for these two people. Rena and Anna came into my office and Rena said, `I just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you. The settlement that you got as a politician&mdash;and a little bit as a lawyer&mdash;enabled me to get through university.' She was dux of her secondary school and she is now doing an honours degree in law and arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most politicians have the opportunity of doing things like that on a reasonably regular basis. We all have people coming in and thanking us for our contribution. We ought to reflect sometimes on how lucky we are to have the ability to impact in such a positive way on those around us. They are the secret things of politics, the things that the gallery and those who argue that we are out of touch do not know about. We are the most `in touch' people in the country, because we are talking to pensioners, business people and farmers all the time. It is compulsory in this game to talk to people and to listen to them. We should debunk this developing myth of being out of touch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking back over the years, I find the imagery very powerful. We have so many opportunities to do so many different things. With colleagues here, I have been to prisoner of war camps in Iraq, for example, looking at the treatment of child prisoners, and to death row in places like China. We have seen horrendously injured people in refugee camps and have reflected on just how lucky we are to live in a country such as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this great country of ours, you have the opportunity of getting around and talking to the people who make the place tick. I do not know whether I am a junkie on this or not. I used to drive cabs around and I was always interested in talking to people, and I still am. It is the thing that I will miss most leaving this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly 13 years in government&mdash;and I stress `in government'&mdash;is really an extraordinary opportunity for anyone. In this game, you sometimes have to be a bit lucky to get yourself elected and to be around at the right time. You go into the cabinet or the ministry, and others around who you know are very competent do not get the same opportunity, for some reason: state, gender or whatever the case may be. I have always cherished that opportunity and have always understood the role of luck in it. Having been the beneficiary of that good fortune or good luck, I determined to make the most of it in terms of policy&mdash;which is, at the end of the day, what we ought largely to be about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my various portfolios I was very fortunate. I was there when the national electricity strategy, the national gas strategy and the national forest policy were developed. For all of the debate around the national forest policy, it is still the foundation stone for going forward in that sector. In the tourism industry there was a continuum with my predecessor, David Simmons, and I. We were able to put together some very big and positive changes for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the industry policy portfolio John Button was in for about 10 years, and for a little while I was able to say I was the second longest-serving industry minister in the government. That did not last too long, as you all know, but I was able to make some contribution to industry policy and for that I was very grateful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of members have mentioned the quality and the importance of our Public Service, and that is something that I have always adhered to. I have been greatly impressed by the people in the Public Service, who&mdash;often with no acknowledgment&mdash;were always prepared to work and do the really hard yards when we were running to deadlines in various areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People thought that I rushed my decision to resign, but the Clerk of the House, Lyn Barlin, knows that I had indicated to him in private, probably a year or so before I did resign, that it was my intention to do so once this process was out of the way. If you tell Lyn anything in confidence, you could not pull the information out of him with pliers. That is one of the reasons why Lyn and his colleague, Ian Harris, are held in such high regard around here. To the running of this important place, they contribute bipartisanship, discretion and  tremendous professionalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we travel overseas on parliamentary delegations, most of the long-suffering taxpayers would perceive that as a great waste of time and effort and they would define those things as junkets. It is my view that it ought to be compulsory for members of parliament to travel; to mix with different cultures, to learn from them, and to seek out, aggressively or otherwise, opportunities for Australia. Overseas travel has been an important part of my development, and I have noticed that it is an important part of the development of my colleagues over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am leaving the parliament in an extraordinarily optimistic frame of mind. This country has come so far so fast in that fundamental question of attitudes that you would be foolish not to be optimistic. This is contrary to the perceived wisdom outside; there is a sense of pessimism about the future, particularly among the younger generation. Things are tough in many areas, they always will be and we should not shy away from that. But there is no doubt that Australia, prospectively, can face a much better future than it might have been able to do when I was a teenager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pascaline and I look forward not to my `retirement'&mdash;it is not a word that I relate to very easily; the member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) said earlier that, when he first came in, he looked around at all the old guys and he was implying that he was now one of them going out of the place; I have not clocked up too many kilometres, but the kilometres I have clocked up have taken a bit out of the old machine&mdash;but to the fact that I am going to slow down to about 100 miles an hour and get involved in business, an area in which I have an intense interest. I will focus on some opportunities that have the added ingredient of being relevant in some of our important bilateral relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am leaving in reasonably good nick, and I note the importance of humour in the operation of this place. I have made a lot of friendships on both sides of the House. It is probably the fact that I am making more friends on the other side of the House that makes me think I might be losing the old killer instinct, and that it is probably time for me to move on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that note, to my colleagues on this side of the House I want to say thank you for the opportunity&mdash;my scaffolding mates used to say to me, `Planks for the memory'&mdash;and thanks for the memory.

That took a bit of adjusting on all sides. Several of the members have talked about their wives and families adjusting.

Hansard adjusted that day and they have never failed us since, but to put Ms Fatin and Ms McHugh was a major adjustment. The Comcar drivers, as Wendy said, would say, `Who do you work for, love?' When you said, `I work for the electors of Phillip,' with sudden deference they said, `I'm sorry, Ma'am.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the delights of coming to parliament, particularly as a woman who had been used to looking after everyone else, was to be so well looked after by the people who opened the door for us, by the Comcar drivers who were always there and, best of all, by the waitresses in the dining room. To be waited on at breakfast, lunch and dinner was an extraordinary thing, particularly for the women coming to this place. </PARA>

The only comment I can suitably make on the situation of Comcars nowadays is that one day someone will have to reinvent Comcars the way they were in days gone by because that was the best possible service and the best value for the taxpayer that there could possibly be. All the Canberra drivers from Harry, whom we used to call `old Harry', to Hank and the very special Ivan in Canberra and all the Sydney drivers, not one of them has ever let me down&mdash;particularly Ray Barrett, Denis George, Paul Dunne and Dick Cruikshank, who have driven me so often in recent years, and Christine Davis, who was one of the first women drivers ever put on. That was one of the things that we did in those days. We expanded the fleet and put on women drivers. Can you remember it?</PARA>

That also goes to Vitas and all in the PHEW branch&mdash;the Parliament House executive wing. But, best of all&mdash;and there is absolutely no doubt of this&mdash;have been the `waiters female'. I am not sure what word we worked out there, Wendy, but waiters female have been absolutely stunning.

Then there are the standing committee secretariats. I know Don Dobie has already spoken about this, and so have others, and I am sure our committee, Don, was one of the best.

The bureau is a group of incredibly innovative and committed people. I name only Philip Noonan because if I started to name everyone else I would have to list a bureau. That means the people there epitomise my concept of the Public Service. Those of us on our side of the House&mdash;many of whose families have been full of public servants such as teachers&mdash;have always expected the Public Service to be doing a job for the public. Certainly, the bureau is doing an enormous job for the consumers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about our staff&mdash;and so many of us have said that we depend on the staff&mdash;my way of expressing it is to say that I am just a name on the door. All the people who have been grateful to their federal member in my electorates over the years owe it to those incredibly committed people. There are too many to name. It is not that there has been a great turnover, but I have had a couple of electorates. Jo Kaar and Matthew Chesher are there now, but there are people all over Australia who will still be thinking of Betty Netting who has been with me for nearly all of 13 years. We have all got people like her. Alan just said that he has the best. We all might want to challenge that&mdash;without taking anything away from your magnificent staffer, Alan. But Betty is the sort of person who changes people's lives. People are in Australia because of Betty; people have achieved health and safety because of Betty. So, on behalf of all of them, thanks to Betty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for my ministerial staff, I am not going to name them. I hope they are not listening&mdash;that they do not know I have got on yet. I just want to say that all of them&mdash;all of them&mdash;are the best. They are absolutely the best and they are certainly responsible for the things that we have been able to do in Consumer Affairs. In the last few years, because of them, we have helped to entrench the truth that basic consumer rights are basic citizens' rights. I think people are going to see, more and more, that whereas we once thought consumer affairs was an area where all the battles were won years ago, there are a lot of battles still to win for citizens' rights and those rights are entrenched in consumer affairs legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have helped make sure that competition will work for, and not against, consumers&mdash;and there are a lot of risks there. Their rights are now entrenched in Consumer Affairs. We have helped prevent the banks from discriminating against people on low incomes, such as pensioners. I think the banks are coming around. We have helped make sure that consumer protection is a basic government responsibility. Every government in Australia has to be aware of that and ensure its existence. We are also developing a whole new culture of safety. I thank everyone in the bureau and everyone in my office for their innovation and their commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to thank my branch members in both Phillip and Grayndler. The branch members in Phillip have been recognised as `THE' best campaigners in Australia. Paul Tracey has been asked to visit electorates all over the country. We just love campaigning! It is sad that that wonderful marginal seat, where you could really enjoy campaigning, is no more. Preventing Charles Copeman from getting into parliament was probably the most exciting campaign we ran. We have prevented quite a few from getting in, but preventing him was the best fun. Those people in Phillip were wonderful campaigners. In fact, as I said, they were `THE' best campaigners in Australia!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Grayndler branch members are absolutely fantastic. At the moment they are facing an extremely difficult time because our constituents are suffering very badly from the airport noise. However, I think they will have confidence in us because our candidate is Anthony Albanese. I look forward to a Labor victory, and particularly to seeing Anthony here in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the past that I have just been talking about, particularly in terms of the entry of women into parliament, it must be said that things have changed because of Labor governments&mdash;and things have to change because of Labor governments. There is an enormous expectation of Labor governments. With the best will in the world, and even on valedictory day, I have to say that I do not think people expect a great deal from Liberal governments. They might want them there every now and then, but it is Labor governments that they expect so much from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I allow that sometimes they get disappointments from us, but they do expect an enormous amount from us, and things do change. The biggest changes in the 12 or 13 years that we have been talking about&mdash;our vintage&mdash;have been in terms of women. There have been changes not only in the number of women in parliament&mdash;which we now want to increase and increase&mdash;but also in lots of other things. These changes include: the provision of child care, where there are substantially more places; anti-discrimination legislation; affirmative action legislation; more girls staying at school to year 12; more girls getting into university; and more young women getting into a wider variety of professions. The whole choice range has changed for young women. However, I have to say again, until men and women share all responsibilities and all opportunities equally&mdash;from domestic duties to running the country&mdash;we will never realise our full potential as a nation, and certainly not as a parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been one of the Left and always will be. Several people have acknowledged the contribution of the Left today. I think it has to be acknowledged a great deal more often, because we are in many ways the leaders. I often remember that, not long after being elected, I was invited by a very, very conservative group in my very marginal electorate to address them at dinner&mdash;a professional group. We had a lovely dinner. I did the speech and then they asked questions. We were obviously getting on very well and then someone said, `But you are in the Left,' and this obviously was a terrifying concept. And I explained what being in the Left meant to me. It meant, first of all, Vietnam, which was something that divided the country, if you like, between Left and Right. It wouldn't now. Child care was once a radical left-wing issue. Nuclear issues were once spoken about only by the Left. The environment was once a left-wing preserve. And I think we do lead. I think we have led in urban development, in worrying about cities and their health, as Brian Howe said this morning; in putting issues like Aboriginal affairs and women's affairs and the environment as crunch issues for the country; and in advancing issues that once one wouldn't dare talk about, like the republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think we are the leaders. Although we are not always recognised, we will always be needed.

And I certainly will never be out of the Left. I will also never be out of politics&mdash;just out of the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike my good friend and colleague the member for Griffiths (Mr Humphreys), who has also made his valedictory speech here today, I didn't think 1977 was a terrific time to come into the federal parliament because that was my first attempt. Having failed on that occasion, I had to pick myself up after the second occasion, after hitting the wall on 18 October 1980, feeling pretty sorry for myself and thinking that was the end of my potential public career.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I want to thank three people: my wife, Kay, who I affectionately call my second best friend; Barry Cohen; and Ross Free, who said to me on that occasion, `You'd really hate it if there was a bit of a swing on next time, you'd been through the hoops and you weren't the candidate.' I want to publicly acknowledge those people for making sure that I had some sort of public life after what I thought was going to be a rather dismal failure. In one sense, as perhaps with Alan Griffiths, people were surprised when I announced that I wasn't going to contest the next election, because the comment was made that I have only been around here for 13 years. That, of course, is true. But, as I kept saying to people, they forget about the six years spent trying to get here in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So 18 to 19 years is not a bad innings, and it has been a particularly satisfying innings to be part of a Labor government all my time in the House. When you think back through the history of Federation and the fact that we are a long-term Labor government, I was fortunate to have served as a member of the government party all that time. For those of us who are retiring and who have also had the special privilege of serving as a minister, it is something that we will cherish all of our lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one sense, I never thought that I would ever have the opportunity to make a valedictory speech. I thought my valedictory speech would not be in this debating chamber but rather outside the divisional returning office in Calare after I had hit the wall in a very difficult marginal electorate as I was congratulating a new member of parliament. So it is a particular thrill, I suppose, for those of us that have made the decision to opt for voluntary redundancy to be able to make a valedictory speech in those circumstances, particularly when we have come from a marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned my wife, Kay. I have always said to her that, during my time here, she was really only one bus accident away from being the next federal member for Calare. Anyone who has seen my wife in operation would know the personal qualities and political attributes Kay has which would have meant that she could easily have been a federal member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently travelled with a colleague from the other side of the House, who will remain nameless. My opposition colleague told me that, when I announced my retirement, members of the opposition were somewhat concerned that my wife would be the next Labor candidate for Calare. Those opposite were concerned because they were fairly confident that, if my wife did stand for Calare, the Labor Party would have an even greater margin than the margin we enjoy at the present time. </PARA>

I also acknowledge my two adult children, both of whom are now married. Paul and his wife, Kim, and my daughter Jane and her husband, David, were in their early teens when I was first elected. We have all commented upon the difficulties and the traumas which are often associated with raising families when one member of the family is involved in public life. There is also the extra responsibility that partners have in such circumstances, because the partner is almost a single parent during the period of public life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay particular tribute to the Calare community. The Labor Party has asked me on seven occasions to be its standard-bearer in Calare, and I am sure it would have asked me again had I chosen to stand for re-election for an eighth occasion. We are not a particularly large organisation in terms of Labor Party membership in the electorate of Calare, but we do manage to staff approximately 95 polling booths on election day. This situation has improved as time has gone on, because in my first campaign there were 125 polling booths. As I often say to my colleagues, I have lots of friends and lots of little committees which operate during the challenging times of elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the countless individuals and organisations who have supported me through the very tough times. Their support allows me to claim&mdash;at least at this point in time&mdash;to be the longest serving Labor member for Calare since the seat was created in 1906. Although some of the people out my way are still convinced that I am a closet Nat, I deny it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of an interesting story involving my colleague the member for Denison, Duncan Kerr. As a community service, he compiled a newsletter to go to people in his electorate indicating the fees which doctors were charging throughout the division of Denison. Some of our colleagues were doing much the same sort of thing and I thought that it was not a bad idea to compile and supply a similar newsletter as a community service to the constituents of Calare. Staff in my office duly rang receptionists at various medical practices in the electorate to check on fee structures. A short time later, one of my staff members received a phone call from a person who said, `What's David Simmons want all this information for? Those dreadful socialists like Duncan Kerr, Ros Kelly and others are doing these sorts of things. Why is he doing it?' It was at this point that my staff member explained that I was a member of the Australian Labor Party. At this point there was a pregnant pause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alan Griffiths made a comment about there being a certain amount of luck in politics. After having hit the wall on two occasions after the first election, I thought my luck had run out when the creative people from the Australian Electoral Commission decided to draw new maps and my original 53 per cent margin became 45 per cent. Many of us, of course, have been subject to the vagaries of lines on maps. However, because of argument and debate and because the National Party was also seeking major changes throughout country New South Wales in 1984, the Electoral Commission was able to accommodate changes. These changes saved my skin in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the last election I thought times were going to be pretty tough because, having increased the margin from 3.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, along came the artist from the Electoral Commission who decided that 1.4 per cent was good enough for me to fight the election on. There is a certain amount of luck, and I am sure that members on both sides have, at one time or another, experienced good luck and, of course, drama as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highlight of my career in parliament would have to have been the first time that I was actually elected. You all certainly remember that time. I certainly remember the euphoria associated with the campaign. There was a wonderful rally in Cook Park in Orange. Bob Hawke, the Leader of the Opposition as he then was, decided to come to Orange just before the election. This rally was being conducted in a park, to the horror of the ALP office in Sussex Street at the time, the usual premise being that when you conduct a rally you try to pick a fairly small building so the crowd can mill out after the meeting. That was a terrific memory for me. As has been done by many speakers who have served as members of the government party here since 1983 and have served in the ministry, we should acknowledge the contribution made at that time by Bob Hawke as Leader of the Opposition and subsequently as Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second occasion that I was really over the moon was at the last election. This was the unwinnable election for us, the so-called election that could not be lost as far as the opposition was concerned. The satisfaction that I am sure all of us enjoyed on that night under the leadership of the great Prime Minister we have in Paul Keating will certainly live with me for the rest of my days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that I have had the privilege of serving in the ministry for almost four years in a range of portfolios. I thank the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and other speakers who have acknowledged my work in that area. In Defence Science and Personnel, where I spent my first time as a minister back in 1989-90, I was very privileged to have actually served as a junior minister to Kim Beazley. Like so many others here, I am sure that Kim Beazley is going to be around in public life for a very long time and will continue to make a contribution. He was a source of great support to me in that obviously important learning period as a minister, and he was a great friend to have in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a particular sense of satisfaction in the portfolio of arts, tourism and territories. The opportunity to be part of the development of a national tourism strategy&mdash;which Alan Griffiths commented upon in his remarks and which was continued by him&mdash;was certainly something that I will remember with a great deal of satisfaction, as I will also remember the countless friends that I have made over a number of years in the arts and tourism industries. The benefits of these friendships are well known for a whole range of reasons to some of my colleagues here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of local government, I was very fortunate to actually be a minister at the time when the government was involved in a major expenditure program with the capital works program. I must have been one of the few ministers who have actually walked into a cabinet room with what was a very modest proposal&mdash;which, let me tell you, was on this occasion about a quarter of what we finally ended up with&mdash;and walked out again, having got double what they thought they were going to get. What a terrific cabinet meeting that was! And then we found out that, eventually, we were going to get double what I thought I was going to have after having doubled the original amount. I am sure that most people here whose electorates were the recipients of the capital works program funds were also very grateful for that program. </PARA>

That was certainly an occasion to remember. As we have said on many occasions, `What a cake and what a celebration!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have commented on the work of the parliamentary committees. I would like to add my two bob's worth there as well. I particularly thank, in the first instance, Leo McLeay, who was chairman of the powerful and influential expenditure committee, of which I was a member after the 1984 election. From him I certainly learnt a lot about parliamentary committees, public hearings and, importantly, inspections associated with those committees. As the government whip has commented, inspections are terribly important to the work of committees, and all of us appreciate that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, after the 1993 election, I had the opportunity to continue my association with the committee, which was then known as the banking, finance and public administration committee. After the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) was elevated to the executive as a parliamentary secretary, I was fortunate enough to assume the chairmanship of that committee. I think we have got a pretty good team, from both sides of the House. We have produced some interesting reports and we have had some interesting times and inspections together. I would particularly thank the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who was originally the deputy chair of that committee, for his generous remarks this afternoon about my chairmanship of that committee. Let me also thank the staff of the secretariat of that committee, led by Chris Paterson. Most of them are probably watching this telecast in my office, waiting for me and other members of the committee to come around and have a few end-of-session lemonades to mark the occasion.

We should be proud that we are the largest country based party in Australia, because we have got, I think, some pretty good people in regional and rural Australia who have served us in this government over the last 13 years. The extent to which regional and rural Australia has returned Labor members of parliament has certainly been the reason why this government has been continually returned since 1983. With the quality of those members and the people who will be standard-bearers for the Labor Party in those regional and rural seats, I am absolutely confident that we will return as the government after the 1996 election. </PARA>

I never served in opposition, and I suppose, like many on this side, I often still find it hard to realise at times that after five terms and 12 or 13 years that is still the case. I have no regrets that after five terms without a day in opposition that record will soon be shattered by the fact that there will be many of the year of l983 who will go on to at least a sixth term at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been an honour and privilege not only to have served my electorate for five terms but to have served as a minister for five or six years under two quite amazing prime ministers, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really enjoyed being one of Bob Hawke's ministers&mdash;it was a great thrill for me&mdash;and I really enjoyed being one of Paul Keating's ministers. There is no-one whom I hold in higher regard for his political skills and as a parliamentarian than Paul Keating, our Prime Minister. We had a bit of a major run-in, I suppose, after the 1993 election. He got his way, but I think that I won. We had a talk about it earlier this year; I am glad that we did and I respect him all the more for what he said to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I consider that I won. The last three years have been a great therapy for me and in many ways very important and valuable years, in a personal way, of my time here. In the years in the ministry, the workload and worry meant that I lost the day-to-day closeness of friendships with a lot of my colleagues; in the last three years I have regained those, and indeed made new friends even among people I had known just as colleagues in the years before. There are a number on this side who know themselves very well in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Ray Braithwaite indicated in his valedictory remarks a short time ago, as one of the shadow ministers in community services at the time I was a minister, he and I had considerable differences of opinion, but our differences were always well intentioned and well regarded. As fate would have it, we had the opportunity, the honour and the privilege of being together at the United Nations last year. That, for me, said a lot of what I think many other members of parliament feel when they go away on delegations, when they meet on committees and so forth, about what Australia is all about and how the image of the parliament outside is very different from the reality of its day-to-day operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three years I have had more time to rediscover many aspects of my personal and family life. Of course, I have also had much more time to get back to my electorate; that is something that I have really very much enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a minister, under Labor's prime ministers, I had the opportunity to do things as a parliamentarian that I had never expected to do. I have no intention of going into any litany of self-supposed achievements, but I want to mention the thing that probably means the most to me. When I came into this place in 1983, and in the period before that, I had read in the papers and heard talk of the Giles and McLeay reports which dealt with the decay of Australia's aged care system. We had a system which was really an abhorrence in a country like ours. If a country cannot look after its young people and its old people, it does not deserve to be recognised as a civilised and modern society. That is how you judge a country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had no national system of standards of care, no national system of cost controls, no fee controls, no real organised or in-depth home and community care services or hostel program. There were no concepts of residents' rights, no major recognition of dementia and the role of carers as major issues. The government embarked upon significant reforms over an eight-stage period, and I am glad that, as I leave, we have now seen major reforms to overcome those shames that were upon us. We need a lot more money in aged care. We always will, because I think we have to exert to the maximum our ability to care for those people who have gone before us in their time of greatest need when they are most vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, we have been remembering, through Australia Remembers, the work and sacrifice of people&mdash;some who gave their lives, some who have died since, some who are still living&mdash;who fought through World War II. Many of those people are now living in nursing homes and hostels. Many of the generation before are still there. Australians today have to recognise their sacrifice&mdash;whether it be in war or peace&mdash;in the most tangible and most important way, by providing care and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done a lot in that regard. When we came in, there were pensioners who used to scrimp and save from their very meagre pension because of the fear of not being able to afford nursing home care. People went without through the better years of their retirement when they could perhaps use their small amounts of money to some great effect to improve their standard of living because they feared the prospect of not being able to afford nursing home care should they need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the great achievements of this government is that it has removed that fear from people and fixed the nursing home rate at 87.5 per cent of the pension. Not only that, but we now have legislative rights in quality care and a national system of accreditation in child care&mdash;both world firsts. We have tackled many hard issues in social policy throughout the years of this government. I have been very pleased and proud to be part of this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Howe mentioned the uplifted status of social policy. I think that has been so far, and will be in future, a hallmark of these Labor governments, and one which Australians will cherish for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Nations, and when I travelled in different parts of the world, it was very clear that in the social policy areas Australia is recognised in the top half dozen or even higher. That is in every social policy area, and that is something we can be proud of as a government. It also says that Australia is a very special country because it wants its government to do these things. When I was travelling I found a very strong realisation that Australia&mdash;unlike many other countries in the world&mdash;had a real sense of community. We do have a sense of community, which is sensed in other terms and other places. Sometimes it is called mateship. We see it in multiculturalism; we see it in our lack of class system; we see it in the acceptance of programs such as Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found that Australians value their society. They see value in a fair share and in a sense of universality. In many other countries you see that as well. In the Nordic countries they have a very strong sense of social policy&mdash;indeed, social justice&mdash;but they have tax rates that Australians would not be very comfortable with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found that Australians get better value for their tax dollar than any other people on this planet. There is a sense of community here that this parliament and the governments of this country need to protect. I have been proud to be part of a Labor government over the past 13 years that has contributed significantly to this sense of community, this sense of universal protection of community. It has made it a central, fundamental objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That came through to me even more starkly in the time I lived for three months in the United States in New York. The United States has got&mdash;as it is very happy to always tell you&mdash;some of the greatest aspects of culture and civilisation in the world, but effectively they live by a law of the jungle. They live in a society that cares little about the community and focuses only on individualism, where government is to be minimised. The United States and Australia are poles apart; Australia sees value in its community. That is something which I think is not recognised as it should be, because we are used to it. It certainly comes through in our spirit and in our government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future for me is about getting the mix right. That means more time with the family&mdash;my wife, Ruth, my kids, mum and dad, my brothers and sisters and all the rest that have let me do my thing for a long time. It means more free time. It means a change in what I do for work. I am looking to all those things, as well as time for my community, with great enthusiasm. That is not to say in any way that I want to leave this place. In a sense it would be nice to have the best of everything. In many ways I think I have, but certainly the decision to leave has been one for me which I have come to very freely and willingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future for the people of Jagajaga, I think, is just as confident and happy and assuring. There was a preselection while I was away in New York. A number of people sought it. There is one I know who would desperately have liked to have won that preselection and get here to do battle again, and that is Pete Steedman. Those of you who were there in that brief period of illumination in 1983-84 will well remember his inimitable contribution to this parliament, whether it be breaking the tie barrier or breaking many more meaningful other barriers&mdash;certainly making quite a radical contribution. Pete did not make it, but I believe the person who has, Jenny Macklin, is a magnificent candidate, a person who has already made a magnificent contribution to Labor government through the national health strategy and the urban and regional review. There are very few people who come into this House with greater experience of government and how government works than Jenny Macklin. I know her experience is already well regarded in the electorate, as it will be here. I have no hesitation whatsoever in predicting that she will be one of the best women ministers of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the dog barks and the caravan moves on, as someone is wont to say. All in all, I leave this Australian parliament a happier man in all regards, not necessarily for leaving but for having been here and now being able to say farewell to you, my colleagues and my friends. They say that in politics your success can be judged by the number of enemies you make, not the number of friends. I find it difficult in this way to judge my success or lack of it, for I do not see much point in counting my enemies. But I do count my friends, and I am pleased with my success as measured by the friends I have made here. </PARA>

Nevertheless, that might be something that I can do in later years. I have always liked writing and I have certainly always liked politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I have certainly been very proud, privileged and honoured to be a member of the Keating Labor government. It has been, as has the Labor government generally for the last 13 years, very prolific in terms of its achievements. One has only got to look at the record of this term of parliament. We passed the Native Title Bill, and who will ever forget that? It was a defining moment in Australian political history. There was vigorous debate over a number of months. It also marked the first time in the history of the House of Representatives that we ever had to sit on a Saturday&mdash;although, if we are here for much longer tonight, Mr Speaker, this might be the second time. It was certainly a memorable moment to be here when the Native Title Bill was passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This term has also seen real moves, promoted by the Prime Minister and this government, towards an Australian republic&mdash;and not before time. I believe it is only a matter of time, although it needs a fair bit of hard work yet to bring about true independence for Australia in the form of a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government continues with its agenda of social justice. I have certainly said many times, before I entered this House and since I have been here, that I am often rueful and lamenting of the dominance of economic rationalism. In fairness, it needs to be said also that, despite economic rationalism, this government has been very much about promoting social justice and fairness in social policy. I might talk a bit later about some of the people who have been responsible for that. The Prime Minister did say, at the caucus drinks the other night, that, unlike other countries which have had Thatcherism and Reaganism, in Australia at least we have had a social safety net and a sense of fairness promoted by devices such as the accord with the trade union movement. We certainly have not gone down the path of countries like the United States, the UK and, more recently, New Zealand, and that is because we have had a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations is an area fraught with difficulty, and I have not always agreed with everything that the government has done, but I do say that the government has made a very genuine attempt in its term of office to bring about an industrial relations system that is fair for everybody. The trade unions do not always agree with what this government has done; certainly the employers often do not agree; and the opposition never agrees with what this government has done in industrial relations. But I think that it has been a painstaking and very difficult task that has been performed to bring about fair and workable legislation. For example, unfair dismissal is a controversial issue, especially when you have got people running scare campaigns, et cetera. But nobody should have anything to fear from due process, and that is all that the unfair dismissal legislation is about, as far as I am concerned. So that, to me, is another key issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I want to talk a bit about the work of the parliamentary committees, certainly the ones that I have been on. The two main ones that I have been involved with are the Public Accounts Committee, chaired very ably by the member for Oxley, Les Scott, and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, chaired by the member for Newcastle, Allan Morris. I think I have been reasonably active, certainly on the community affairs committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue that I want to talk about&mdash;it has provided some disappointment to me but I raise it for a particular reason&mdash;is that, as all members know, we have to balance priorities. As members of parliament, it is expected that we have to balance competing pressures and competing priorities, and one of those is the balance you strike between how much time to put into parliamentary committees or caucus committees and the obvious constituent work, electorate work and party work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that I have been criticised for supposedly spending too much time working on parliamentary committees and not spending enough time in the electorate. This criticism is hurtful at times because, firstly, I do not believe it is true, and, secondly, I make no apology for saying that, unlike some people I talk to from time to time, I believe that politics and being involved in politics is about policies, issues, values, beliefs and&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;ideology. Being involved in politics is also about representing your electorate and representing the people in the electorate. I have done a fair bit over the last 15 years towards representing people in the trade union movement, at local government level and as a federal member. Being involved in politics is about these issues. I do not believe that members are here for any other reason than to make the country a better place and to implement better social policy and better policy generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of sayings that I want to quote. There is one saying which goes along the lines that, if keeping your job becomes more important than doing your job, maybe you should not be in the job. There is another saying which says that people get the governments they deserve. Perhaps people also get the members of parliament they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Committee work is important, although it has been said to me that there are no election or preselection votes in my going to a parliamentary committee hearing in Adelaide or Perth or in my doing this or that on policy. However, as far as I am concerned I do not take this attitude. If people want to say that this attitude has cost me another term in parliament, so be it; it is for other people to judge. I joined the Labor Party in, I think, 1979 because I believe in what the Labor Party stands for and because I believe in social policy and social justice. I did not join the Labor Party with any particular expectations or with the ambition to become a member of parliament or even with any hope of working in a political job or anything like this. I joined the Labor Party and got involved in the union movement because I believe in it, because I enjoy it and because I enjoy helping people in areas that I believe in. I do not think I have changed in this respect and I do not think I am ever likely to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anything, at times I find it frustrating that I have not been able to spend enough time working on policies or making enough difference in some of the committees that I have had the opportunity to be a member of. To give one example, I was also a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, which is chaired by the redoubtable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). I do not think the member for Lalor is terribly impressed by my attendance record because I do not think I have been to more than three meetings in the whole term. However, this committee does a lot of important and interesting work and it is disappointing to me that I could not get more involved in its work. But, coming back to the point I made before, you do have to weigh up priorities; this is what it is about and this is the way it goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention some of the caucus committee work that I have been involved in; work that I believe is worthwhile and which has, hopefully, made a bit of a difference. I am on the caucus economics and industrial relations committee and, by virtue of being secretary of the committee, I was a member of the employment task force which was chaired by the member for Lilley (Mr Swan). This caucus committee played a very important role in providing input by the backbench members of the caucus to a green paper which itself became very much the basis on which Working Nation was formed. Working Nation is another of the major policy initiatives of this government, and I am very pleased to have been involved in its preparation. We had a few interesting debates and we certainly collected a lot of information from people. At the end of the day, the product is a pretty good one for the Australian people. Employment is continuing to go up, and you do not need me to repeat the positive things which have been said about Working Nation or to repeat the very positive things which have been achieved in the last 18 months. In a very real way through the task force, caucus was able to provide input to the positive things which have been achieved, and I believe that it is very important for Labor governments to have this caucus input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have obviously been involved fairly heavily in the caucus community services committee, which is chaired by the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). This committee is a pretty important committee in the sense that it seems it covers so many different portfolios: social security, all the different aspects of human services and health, veterans affairs and so on. For Labor governments concerned with social justice, this particular committee is a key committee. I am very pleased to have been part of this committee. The committee became so big, at one stage, that it had to be split; the caucus housing and regional development committee was formed, which was chaired by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). I was also a member of this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising out of the caucus community service committee, I was asked to chair a subcommittee or working group on mental health, and this work is one of the things that has given me most pleasure and is something I have been able to devote some time to in the last 18 months. Brian Howe actually spoke earlier today about the national mental health strategy. As the minister then responsible, it was his belief, arising out of the strategy and out of the Burdekin report, that the Commonwealth really needed to play a much greater role in mental health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with so many other areas of social policy, it has&mdash;sadly and regrettably, in my view&mdash;always been the province of the states. Certainly, constitutionally, state governments have responsibility; and in areas such as mental health, Aboriginal health and many others, perhaps that is why those issues have been neglected in the past. It was decided, quite rightly, that the Commonwealth should play a greater role, and that decision was reflected in the formation of this committee. Shortly after that, Brian Howe changed portfolios, but I am pleased to say that the commitment to mental health at the Commonwealth level has been well and truly continued by the current minister, Carmen Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being offered the position of the chair of that subcommittee gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about mental health, which was one area of social policy that I did not really have much of a background in. I was able to meet people in the mental health sector and a number of mental health workers, consumers and carers right across the spectrum. I think I played some part, and I certainly received feedback in terms of the Commonwealth's role and the fact that people in the community appreciate that the Commonwealth is now taking a role in mental health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank all the people in the Australian National Association of Mental Health, the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition and the other peak mental health groups, and the various groups around different states that I have had contact with and that have given me great support. I will not try to name them all, but they have given me great support and encouragement and, in particular, have been very supportive of me in recent months since my failure to regain preselection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking of mental health and the people I have met reminds me of something that was said to me a few months ago at a conference. I was talking to a young man who was a mental health consumer and was a member of one of the ministerial advisory groups on mental health. He said to me, `Chris, you don't seem like a member of parliament.' I looked at him and I thought, `Here we go again; this is another bruise to the ego coming up; what have I done now?' I said to him, `What do you mean?' He said, `You're not arrogant or anything; you seem like a nice bloke.' I thought, `Oh, I see!' and then it dawned on me that he actually was paying me a compliment. But it also dawned on me that many people have said that to me, and one can never be quite sure how to take it. But I think it was meant as a compliment in that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that story says a bit about my attitude, but I think it also says a lot about the life that politicians lead. We really are all ordinary people. Perhaps it also reflects on the fact that we are all sometimes unfairly treated by the media and by people who expect certain things of politicians but forget that we are all people like everybody else and are trying to represent the rest of the people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I joined the Labor Party in the late 1970s because I was committed to the social objectives that I grew up learning about. My teen years were the 1960s, when Gough Whitlam was Leader of the Opposition and we had the Vietnam War and pressures for social change. I did not even get to vote in 1972 because I was too young, being under 21, as the voting age was then. I certainly got to vote at the next election, when Gough was returned as Prime Minister for a second term, albeit a brief one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) earlier today made a reference to my cricket career. It was interesting that Kim Beazley and I both played at different times for the same club in Perth, the Claremont-Cottesloe Cricket Club. I was there from 1973 to 1977, and that period included the year 1975, when Gough Whitlam's Labor government was sacked. A lot of people commented a couple of weeks ago, on the 20th anniversary of the dismissal, that everyone knows where they were when Gough Whitlam's government was sacked. I certainly remember where I was. I was actually at work in Perth in the social security office when it happened. That night I was at cricket training and, at the time, I was almost the only Labor voter to play cricket for that club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what I remember more vividly was the election in December 1975 when the Labor Government was defeated rather comprehensively. In Western Australia we held only one seat, which coincidentally was the seat that I lived in. I happened to vote for Kim Beazley senior in Fremantle and it was the only seat that we held in Western Australia. The election day in December 1975 was the day of a Test match at the WACA and so we didn't play club cricket that day. I was invited to a party at the home of one of the players after everyone went to the Test match. It wasn't until I got there that the television was blazing with the election results. By the time the polls closed in Western Australia it was 11 p.m. in the eastern states and it was all over, and I was the only Labor supporter at the whole party. I do not know where most of you were on the night of the election in 1975 but I was amongst a bunch of Tory cricketers in Western Australia and it wasn't the most pleasant or enjoyable night I have ever experienced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election defeat and the outrage that many of us felt helped eventually to motivate me to get involved in the Labor Party and in politics. I know that I and a number of other members making our first speeches in 1993 mentioned that we had been motivated by the events of 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one particular incident that night that I will mention to the House. It was getting fairly late and everybody had had a fair bit to drink at that stage. We were talking away and I was having a conversation with some people&mdash;I forget what it was about now; it might not even have been about the election&mdash;when I suddenly heard my name called very loudly from behind me and the whole place stopped. Everyone turned around, I turned around and this very large gentleman behind me&mdash;a first grade fast bowler&mdash;said, `What did you say?' and I thought, `God, what did I say?' It turned out that I had used a four-letter word or something and this particular gentleman had a thing about people swearing when his wife was present, so I had to apologise. I remember that, because it was with some amusement and interest about five years ago that I discovered that this same bloke, Dexter Davies&mdash;he was actually a friend at the time&mdash;had become the president of the Western Australian division of the National Party. That is a story that I have dined out on a few times in the Labor Party in my electorate, and I shall certainly be reminding Dexter of it when I see him at the centenary dinner of the club in two months time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might take the opportunity to mention some of the other retiring members that have spoken today. Brian Howe, of course, as has been said a number of times, has been a very fine minister with a particular focus on social justice and social policy and a commitment to ensuring that this government delivered good social policy and that his department delivered good social policy. I worked for the department for which Brian was the minister from 1990 to 1993, which has had a variety of different names but these days is called the Department of Human Services and Health. I recall that nobody who worked for the department then had any doubt of Brian Howe's commitment to his agenda of social justice in all the different programs, particularly the ones that Brian has worked on very hard and successfully in this government&mdash;the housing program, disability services and, as I have already mentioned, the mental health area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Staples was also a minister in the same portfolio for about six years that I worked in it. He had aged care, child care and family services. He was an excellent minister in that period, and his commitment was certainly well noted by all the people who worked for the department, as it has been noted by the Prime Minister today and his other caucus colleagues that have spoken. He was an outstanding minister, and I actually mentioned him in my first speech here because of the work that he had done in promoting the Commonwealth policy on child care, because child care is a very important issue in the electorate of Macarthur, being an electorate with a young population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jeannette McHugh has always been a particular inspiration to me. I can recall Jeannette, from about l979 onwards, speaking at state conferences of the Labor Party at the Sydney Town Hall. She made particularly passionate and emotional, but very sincere, speeches about, in particular, uranium and related issues. She was always an inspiration. I recall working briefly for her campaign in Phillip in l980&mdash;my union was doing some work in that electorate, amongst others. She did not win that time, but she certainly made up for that in l983. She has been an inspirational member of the Left&mdash;both on the ground and in federal parliament. She has, and deservedly so, been Minister for Consumer Affairs for the last four years and has shown her usual commitment in that area as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank David Simmons for the local capital works program in l992. I know that everyone on this side of the House appreciated it. It was particularly beneficial for me as, at the time, I was involved in local government on the Campbelltown City Council and on the executive of the New South Wales Local Government Association. That program came in very handy. That was not just because I was a marginal seat candidate. There were suggestions that that program was a bit of a marginal seats winning program. If it was, it was not a very good one because David Simmons's electorate of Calare did not get one cent from that program and he was the minister. But it was an excellent program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I might also say that I believe sincerely that the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program of this government was also an excellent program which provided amenities in areas where they were needed. I was sorry to see the end of that program, especially in the circumstances that it came about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give my best wishes to some of the other former ministers and members who are retiring&mdash;and I do not know some of those as well as the others: Ben Humphreys, Russ Gorman, Alan Griffiths and Eric Fitzgibbon. I have enjoyed your company. Michael Duffy is also going. I do not know Michael very well, but I certainly know that he is one of the most respected members of the caucus and he was certainly one of the ministers most respected by backbenchers in the last 13 years. Wendy Fatin has also, like other people I have mentioned, demonstrated a commitment to social justice, and I wish her well. </PARA>

I would particularly like to thank the members of the Government Caucus Committees Secretariat&mdash;Doreen, Shirin, Frances and all the rest of those people&mdash;because without them we would not be as effective as we are in caucus and in caucus committees. They do a wonderful job. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank those members of the Labor party in the electorate of Macarthur who have stood by me and assisted me over the three years&mdash;including the last few months&mdash;for their support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank my family: my wife, Kerry, and my three daughters, Angela, Brigitte and Jacqueline. Politics is alleged to be notorious for the strain it puts on families. I am probably no exception to the rule. We all have to deal with that. In my case it has been not only for the three years here but for six years in local government. Local government councillors have day jobs as well, so it becomes taxing on families and the time we get to spend with them. Previous to that my time in the trade union movement has all added to the toll. Certainly, I would like to thank my wife and three children for their support and for getting me through these three years, particularly the last few months. Their support has been very important to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good luck to everyone, but particularly good luck in electoral terms to all my colleagues on this side of the House. Good luck to people like Peter Knott, Maggie Deahm, Garrie Gibson, Mary Crawford, Peter Dodd and especially all those marginal seat candidates in New South Wales and Queensland who have the fight ahead of them. I am confident that more of them will get through than will not. Like most of the people who have spoken before me, I think we will win and that the Keating government will continue after the next election. I believe that we deserve to because of some of the things I mentioned that we have done in the last three years. I believe we still have the best policies to govern Australia in the broader sense to continue our objective of social justice. The words `social justice' get thrown about a lot. It is probably an overused term. I probably use it too much as well. It does have a meaning, especially to people on this side of the House. So when I say social justice, I mean everything to the fullest extent. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On my own side, Mr Speaker, much has been said about the people who are retiring&mdash;a very distinguished group&mdash;but I want to say of Michael Duffy that somebody ought to mention, during his time as Attorney-General, the one time I had a serious dispute with my then senior minister, Robert Ray. It had to do with the treatment of the sexes in the armed services. It became known as the debate about gays in the armed services. In fact, it was about sexual conduct in the services. There we fought a victory for a very important principle, and we got further with it in this country than has happened in the United States. I shall miss Michael, as everybody here will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to Eric Fitzgibbon, who was FK, and who added a great deal of spice to our lives, and to Brian Howe. Many people more qualified that I am have spoken of him. Along with them I pay tribute to Russ Gorman, a character if ever there was one; Chris Haviland, who preceded me in this debate; and Ben Humphreys, whom I first knew as a whip but who was a very distinguished minister for veterans' affairs. </PARA>

We came in as a group of 28 new members, of whom 16 are still around&mdash;there will not be that number after the next election&mdash;and six senators, although, of course, one does not count them! Many of them rose to ministerial office or did other things of considerable use and relevance in this place. </PARA>

It did not give him the judgment not to support Essendon in the AFL, but there you go. Jeannette McHugh is a woman with passions&mdash;and I think she has had the chance to indulge those passions here&mdash;a passion for equality and a passion for social justice. I admire her, even though I am not from her part of the Labor Party. Peter Staples, along with his mate Pete Steedman, did a great deal about the dress standards in this place. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in speaking of him, said that he did groundbreaking work. He did groundbreaking work in the areas of aged care and child care. I had the office next door to his, and may I say also that, when he was a minister, his ministerial office was the most responsive to the concerns of backbenchers that I have ever known. I admired him for that. </PARA>

She could have become a minister earlier than she did, but she chose instead to carry out her family responsibilities. She had a very sick father. She is a nurse, and another woman I admire. Last but not least of that group is David Simmons, a prominent member of the prayer group but also a Labor member from the bush. That is a pretty difficult thing to be. I know there are more of us from the bush than there are of the National Party, but it is still not easy.

My first dealings with David were when I was a young student and came to him to complain about what was going on in the SRC in the Australian Union of Students. David took up this cause. He even spoke about it on the adjournment in this parliament. In those days the adjournment debate was obviously taken much more seriously than it is today because it was covered in the national newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the 1980s David was a regular visitor to my parents' home, often in company with the then state member for Gordon. The state member would invariably stand up and say, `Ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to make a long and boring speech,' and he would then add, `I am going to make a short and boring speech.' He was wrong on both counts. David was never like that. David's speeches were always informative, combative, witty and brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the lowest time of my life, at a time when I emerged bloodied and bowed from three years wrestling with God at the seminary, it was David Connolly who arranged to get me a job. I guess it was my own silly fault that instead of taking the job David arranged, I went off and started writing articles for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. I hope that one day I might even be in a position to return the compliment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David is a member of that class of 1974&mdash;a most unfortunate class in the federal parliamentary Liberal Party because so many of them entered their political prime just as the federal parliamentary party was entering a long period of opposition. It is my great hope that some of those members might enter into their own after the next election and might have the opportunity to prove to this nation what they are capable of. Unfortunately, David will not be part of it. It is his personal tragedy that he is not able to show indisputably to the whole world that, as far as the Liberal Party is concerned, he was always a component of the solution, not a component of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was there on the day that David lost his pre-selection. It was an ugly day for everyone; it was a most unfortunate day, a most difficult day. I have to say that the people there were not voting against David. They were voting against 13 years of opposition. They were voting against all that mob that had lost for all that long. So in the years David has ahead of him I hope that he does not take it personally because, believe me, those Liberals were not voting against him. They were voting for victory, not for defeat. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not quite been wedded to Eric Fitzgibbon's plan for parliamentary reform. Eric's contribution and Russ Gorman's contribution point up the value to the parliament of people who say that they see their role, quite properly, as just being representatives of their electorate and who do not necessarily wish to seek higher office. Many of the other people who have spoken have held ministerial office. But people like Eric Fitzgibbon and Russ Gorman add a texture to this parliament that all the parties should ensure we keep here, because there is a very valuable contribution to be made, both in party rooms and in the chamber, by people who can genuinely articulate the voice of the person on the street. If we start to get too specialised, or have parties full of ambitious people, that flavour will be lost. I will miss both Eric and Russ for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will miss Alan Griffiths very much because he is probably my best friend, and this will not be as nice a place without him. The Labor Party will also miss Alan. As Kim Beazley said, if Alan Griffiths had stayed, he would certainly have been one of the people who would have been in contention for the leadership of this party in the future. I wish him and his wife Pascaline well in the future. I suppose that a plus for me in Alan leaving the parliament is that he is probably going to move to Sydney, and that means we will probably see as much of each other as we do now, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the year, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Labor Party side particularly for putting up with the way we try to drive them in here to vote at all sorts of peculiar hours of the day and night. Fortunately, we do not have too many night-time sittings any more, because the Main Committee has been able to take up that role and we have not had any late night sittings this year. Usually, at this time of the year, we would have been sitting late all week and we would have had a running guillotine going on today. The Main Committee has civilised us a little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to particularly thank you, Mr Speaker, and the chairs of the parliamentary committees, the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker, who are the people who provide the chair duty for the Main Committee. They work very well in that job. I would also like to thank Ted Grace and Rod Sawford, who are my two deputies, who have made my life much easier through their great and unfailing support over the year. In particular, I would like to thank Joan, Karen and Linda for the work that they do in my office. As someone said earlier, no-one likes the Whip, but one thing that is true is that everybody on the government side likes Joan Connor; and Karen and Linda provide a very light atmosphere in that office, which I think is very useful and very helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Jeannie Hall, and her staff help make our life easier. The professionalism of the Parliamentary Liaison Office is shown in the fact that, although the staff has nearly all changed this year, the changeover has been almost seamless. That just shows what a good job they do. The staff of the Table Office, the Bills and Papers Office and the Serjeant-at-Arms' Office, who all help my office with a number of things, have also been useful and helpful, and I thank them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly thank all those people who sometimes find that the Whip's office rings them up and says, `We need you to speak on a bill in five minutes time,' and who say, `Thank you; we didn't really need that much time to prepare.' The government members have been good in their response to those requests, and I thank them very much for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will complete my remarks by reiterating my thanks to Rod and to Ted and also to the Chief Opposition Whip and his staff for the cooperation that we have had with each other.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of myself and my family, I wish every other member and their family a happy Christmas. To all the members here, I hope that every single one of you is returned at the next election, whenever it is held. That will mean that those people who have been working hard in the job that they have been doing on the opposition side of the House will continue to be able to do it because they have trained for it for a long while, and that the people over this side who do their job well will be able to do it because they have been doing it for quite a while too. If we can say that we hope that everybody gets re-elected, then that will be a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just finish off by saying that I will also miss Ray Braithwaite. Ray was a member of the expenditure committee when I first got elected to this parliament. It was the first parliamentary committee that I was on. I thought there was some symmetry in Ray Braithwaite and Ken Aldred retiring at the same election, because at one stage, when the expenditure committee was doing a report into government purchasing&mdash;the coalition was in government&mdash;the National Party members and the opposition members from the Labor Party ganged up on poor old Aldred and we would not provide a quorum so that a report that Aldred was very keen on getting out just before the election could be brought down. The committee never had a quorum because Ray and I never used to go to the meetings. Aldred lost his seat at the election and Braithwaite and I were re-elected. I was elected the chairman of the committee. We re-established a subcommittee of which Braithwaite was the chairman, to bring down Aldred's report. There is some symmetry, I guess, in Ken Aldred and Ray Braithwaite leaving at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always found Ray to be a very decent person.

At the end of the day they both believe in the institution of parliament and the institution that is the chamber of the House of Representatives.

In this difficult, combative chamber, a little bit of that occasionally also helps. In that respect, I would like to thank Gary Punch, David Beddall, Ross Free, Leo McLeay, Neil Andrew and Michael Ronaldson, in particular.

I was drawing attention to a decision about the location of a departmental building in Dickson. I was questioning whether this location was appropriate. There are a number of relevant issues. The first issue is whether it is appropriate for a building of 6,000 square metres to be located in an area which is not an employment centre. It is a service centre. In service centres, the maximum size of buildings is supposed to be 2,000 square metres. This building is three times larger than the maximum.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the process through which the lease was let also raises some questions. Why was this site selected? Why was this developer chosen? What were the relationships between the developer and the people making the decision? If there were any friendships involved, were conflicts of interest declared, and, if not, why not? What formal or informal undertakings were given to the applicants or the developer regarding a future sublease of offices and what might be the commercial value of such pre-commitment from tenants? This is not the appropriate moment to go into any more detail than that. This particular incident raises important questions which the ACT government needs to investigate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, and I appreciate the Christmas spirit in which it was extended to me. I wish to expand on the speech I gave in the House on Tuesday in relation to this matter of Wanneroo Inc. Ironically, yesterday afternoon detectives investigating Wanneroo Inc. charged a developer with bribing corrupt former mayor Dr Wayne Bradshaw in 1987. Police will allege that a Mr Dominic Cassella paid Dr Bradshaw $20,000 in October 1985 when Mr Cassella was involved with the development of the Ocean Reef medical centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was attacked in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly yesterday for being paranoid, for somehow overreacting. I made the comment in my speech that the September conviction by the District Court of Wayne Bradshaw for official corruption was not a one-off event. Yesterday's charges show that there are other matters still on the way. I just wanted to point that out to those three members. Wayde Smith denied being an associate of Dr Bradshaw some short time ago. He was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of October 1993 as emphatically denying having any association with Dr Bradshaw, even though he actually held power of attorney for him and was a director of a number of companies in which they had business interests. There have also been allegations on television that a cheque that was given to him for $50,000 was signed over into an account controlled by him. He is still a member of the legislative assembly at the moment and he will continue to be and will become more of an extreme embarrassment to the Liberal Party in the area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out, in relation to this question of Wayde Smith and his relationship with Dr Bradshaw and others who were in this clique that was developing control of the northern metropolitan area of the Liberal Party activities, that Mr Smith spent a great deal of time trying to tell people that he had no contacts whatsoever with Wayne Bradshaw. He then had to change his mind when the truth became apparent, and he then apologised for lying publicly to the community. In fact, he was on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> for about four days, apologising, in the final analysis, for those particular lies. At the time when he said he had no business interests whatsoever with Dr Bradshaw, he was in debt to him to the tune of something like $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not resile from any of the comments that I made on 28 November. They were comments made in the spirit of wanting a resolution to a longstanding and serious problem in the area. The people who attacked me in the legislative assembly, Wayde Smith, Rob Johnson and Ian Maclean, were part of that. I understand why they would want to attack me and show that I was either paranoid or not telling the truth. All I can do is point to the record. It is quite clear, open and in the public domain. </PARA>

The computer bounty is currently scheduled to expire at the end of December of this year. At the eleventh hour, the government has proposed a number of amendments that will extend the bounty for another five years until 31 December 2000. The decision to extend the computer bounty comes after much stalling by the government. For well over a month now, we have been reading that a decision on the future of the bounty was imminent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports extension of the computer bounty. We have a commitment to support the development of an internationally competitive IT&amp;T sector. We recognise that the very great potential that the information technology and telecommunication industries possess will not be maximised without a supportive policy environment. This requires a strategic vision on the part of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is committed to providing the vision and leadership necessary to help the industry maximise the opportunities for growth and development as we move towards the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1987, the government has provided support to the IT&amp;T sector through its information industries strategy. In its early days, that strategy undoubtedly played a role in setting goals for increased production, employment, exports and R&amp;D in the IT&amp;T sector. However, I am concerned that the government's approach has not kept pace with dramatic change in that sector. I quote from a recent policy submission, prepared by a leading IT company, which in fact was IBM:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The programs and policy thinking that created the framework of the information industries strategy are only encouraging the retention of an industry structure of the 1980s and not one for the 1990s and the next century.</PARA>
<PARA>The international IT industry has been subject to dramatic forces of change and development over the past decade. The industry has been at the forefront of global economic and technological change over that decade. Australia's IT industry has likewise undergone rapid development. In particular, there has been very strong growth in areas of software development and related areas of service provision. Yet, if you look through the various components of the government's existing information industries strategy, you will find that these areas receive by far the least assistance. Moreover, it is worth noting that, while activities such as the production or assembly of microcomputers, minicomputers, mainframes, personal computers, computer equipment, printed circuit boards and eligible systems hardware all receive bounty assistance, production of other computer components and telecommunications systems are still the subject of tariff protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, I have a number of information technology companies that also deal in manufacture of significant printed circuit board and modern technology. Three of those companies that do significant business are Telspec, Siemens and Datacraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to present to the House a little bit of a letter from Telspec to me back in September of this year. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Bob,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I would like to confirm our push for continuation of the Computer Bounty or equivalent industry assistance scheme. The reasons for our strong support for such a scheme were discussed with you at length. They can be summarised as follows:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The Computer Bounty Scheme represents $500,000 of industry assistance used to fund Research and Development and expansion into export markets.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Computer Bounty is by far our biggest Government assistance, along with 150% R&amp;D concession of $800K or $264K tax effective assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Australia must export. Telspec utilises Computer Bounty to assist and overcome Trade barriers such as:-</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 Computer Bounty assisted Telspec in obtaining new export business in Indonesia and in Hongkong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Telspec has experienced considerable export growth. This is exactly what Australia needs . . . This growth will NOT be as rapid if Computer Bounty ceases. Timing is very important. The Telecommunications Industry is growing and Industry assistance like Computer Bounty helps companies like Telspec take advantage of opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Computer Bounty ceases it should be replaced with a similar scheme. If Computer Bounty ceases and no other scheme is implemented, Australia could end up "throwing out the baby with the bath water" and lose the chance to take advantage of the many opportunities that are presenting themselves in the Telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The above represents a summary of the vital points of our discussion held 11th September 1995. Once again, thanks for taking the time to visit Telspec. I am sure the visit was of mutual benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure the House that it was, because now we have the computer bounty still intact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Industry Commission pointed out in its report on the IT sector:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assistance regime may have been appropriate when telecommunication and computer based activities were clearly separate, and software and computer services were in their infancy. Today, however, this situation seems anomalous.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the ever increasing convergence of technologies in the IT&amp;T sector, efforts to define what constitutes hardware, software, software embedded in hardware and systems, and applications software, are becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, so too is the administration of the bounty and the other forms of assistance that apply to different parts of the IT&amp;T sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the coalition's proposal that, upon taking office next year, which we will well and truly do, we will bring together a task force of industry representatives and departmental people to overhaul the existing information industries strategy and revamp it to meet the emerging challenges of the next decade. Among other things, the task force will be asked to consider the industry benefits of harmonising industry assistance arrangements for the IT&amp;T sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we will support all the amendments proposed by the government, I would note that the coalition is concerned about the impact of the decision to exclude research and development from the bounty. Over recent years, claims for R&amp;D have accounted for a growing proportion of the payments under the computer bounty scheme. According to the figures, in excess of $30 million per annum, or around 40 per cent of total payments under the existing bounty, is for R&amp;D purposes. Secondly, more than 65 per cent of all bounty recipients claim some R&amp;D. Thirdly, for 30 per cent of all claimants, R&amp;D comprises more than half of their total bounty claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said that the decision to exclude R&amp;D from the bounty was taken on the basis that there is already a wide range of alternative programs supporting research and development. It is true that there is a range of alternative programs that support business R&amp;D activity, including the 150 per cent tax concession, the competitive grants for industry R&amp;D, and the concessional loans for commercialisation of technological innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the sad reality is that Australia's business R&amp;D performance is one of the poorest in the developed world. The Industry Commission's report on R&amp;D highlights the fact that, out of the 24 OECD nations, Australia ranks 18th in terms of the share of national income that is devoted to business research and development. This is absolutely unacceptable. Access to state-of-the-art technologies and the ability to innovate and adapt to the rapidly changing demands of an increasingly sophisticated market are crucial to the prosperity of Australian industry. The government's decision to exclude R&amp;D as an eligible factory cost under the computer bounty will undoubtedly affect a large number of those firms currently receiving payments. As the Industry Commission points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firms not making taxable profits are generally not in a position to benefit from the 150% tax concession, but if recommendations in the Commission's report on Research and Development are implemented these firms will benefit from a subsidy of 18% on R&amp;D . . . Thus some firms that lose the 8% subsidy to R&amp;D through the bounty, could have access to an 18% subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition will be pursuing this course of action through other avenues. I will certainly be interested to see how the government responds to the Industry Commission's review of R&amp;D arrangements in next week's long awaited innovation statement. </PARA>

<PARA>The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 will amend five acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio. It will also consequentially amend a number of acts within the responsibility of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of the Treasury. The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. They are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the bill. The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 will rationalise the arrangements for hearing reviews of adverse or qualified security assessments made under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. Applications for review are currently heard by the Security Appeals Tribunal, which has no other function. Although it is arguable that the Security Appeals Tribunal's separate status and exclusive function were justified when it was established in 1979, its work load has declined since the early 1980s and it is now averaging less than one application a year. In fact, it has received only two applications in the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abolition of the Security Appeals Tribunal and transfer of its function to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will produce minor reductions in expenditure and administrative burden, in so far as it will no longer be necessary to have a separate annual report or separate retainers for some of its members. Moreover, the separate existence of the Security Appeals Tribunal has become increasingly theoretical as more and more of its members and staff have been drawn from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications for review will be heard by a new security appeals division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Following this, it was agreed that the operations of the tribunal should be reviewed to assess the delivery of services by the tribunal and the effectiveness and efficiency of the tribunal's existing operation, administrative arrangements and structures. Similar reviews were undertaken in the federal and family courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review was conducted by representatives of the tribunal, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance between October 1990 and November 1991. The report of the review made some 200 recommendations for reform. Many of those recommendations related to the internal operation of the tribunal and have been implemented by the president of the tribunal. The review also made a number of recommendations for amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. Some changes to the act recommended by the review were made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Act 1993. This bill includes amendments to implement other recommendations of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments are directed at streamlining the procedures of the tribunal and clarifying the power of the tribunal in procedural matters. The amendments will enable the tribunal to operate more flexibly and will assist the tribunal to achieve maximum efficiency. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the bill. The bill that was considered by the Senate contained a provision inserting a new reading down provision in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That provision was opposed by the coalition and, pleasingly, the government moved an amendment to withdraw that provision during the committee stage of the bill in the Senate. I must say that was the significant difference between this speech and the second reading speech that was delivered in another place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes amendments, both of a policy nature and a technical nature, in relation to the matters enumerated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition had concerns with the bill in a number of specific areas, including amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act. As a result, we referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for consideration. The majority of the committee endorsed the bill, and the dissenting report senators&mdash;Senators Ellison, O'Chee and Spindler&mdash;objected to the amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act which the government withdrew in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill abolishes the Security Appeals Tribunal and transfers its function to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This will produce minor reductions in expenditure and decrease administration. In the last five years, the function of the SAT has become increasingly redundant, as only two applications for appeal have been heard. By transferring it to the AAT, it will be no longer necessary to have a separate annual report or separate members. Increasingly, members and staff of the SAT have been drawn from the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will take into account the specialised nature of the work of the SAT by incorporating within the AAT provisions of the ASIO Act which relate to confidentiality of proceedings and the qualifications for appointments. For example, the new subsection 19(3B) will prohibit any non-presidential member of the AAT with past or present ASIO employment from being assigned to the security appeals division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia did express concern over the inclusion of proposed section 39A(9)(b) which they say is draconian and unnecessary. This provision purports to exclude disclosure of certain evidence to the applicant, or a person representing the applicant, when evidence is given or submissions are made which are the subject of a minister's certificate given under that section, unless the responsible minister consents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was one of the issues that was considered by the Senate committee. The committee made no recommendation with respect to the provision. On balance, given the need to protect the source and the method of discovery or protect dissemination of information in areas of government security, we do not oppose the provision. We would expect the need for a certificate to be very rare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to amendments relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the bill amends the act to give effect to recommendations in the 1991 report of the review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These amendments are directed at streamlining the procedures of the AAT and clarifying the powers of the AAT in procedural matters. The provisions in the bill are: for two-member hearings; for the office of conference registrar; that, where the parties consent, the AAT may dispense with a hearing if the issues are suitable for determination in the absence of the parties; that, after an application for review of a decision has been lodged, the decision maker may only vary the decision where the decision maker is specifically authorised to do so by the relevant statute or the AAT and the parties, and for review by the tribunal of a taxation of costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the changes to the act recommended by the review were enacted by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Act 1993. The amendments will also provide that the AAT has power to remit matters to the decision maker for reconsideration at any stage in the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to amendments consequential on the amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. An amendment has been made to that act which incorporates the term `district registrar' because it reflects the administrative practice of the tribunal under which much of the work is decentralised or is undertaken by the district registrar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following acts have had a consequential amendment made to reflect this change: Estate Duty Assessment Act 1914, Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, Payroll Assessment Act 1941, Payroll (Territories) Assessment Act 1971 and Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. There are also consequential amendments to the Federal Proceedings (Costs) Act 1981 which will ensure that, where a matter is reheard by the AAT under a two-member tribunal, an applicant is entitled to a costs certificate. This will enable the Attorney-General to authorise payment in relation to a costs certificate, up to a maximum amount of $2,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. Currently, the Federal Court is able to refer proceedings, with the consent of parties, to arbitration. However, there is no appeal mechanism for awards made in court-referred arbitration. The bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act to enable a party to an arbitration to seek a review, on a question of law, of an award made in arbitration. Where the arbitration is not complete, a party to the arbitration will be able to request the arbitrator to seek leave of the Federal Court for a review on a question of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council's federal litigation section supports the changes for a referral of questions of law to the court. However, the section considers that the provision is unduly restrictive and that litigants should be able to make such an application personally in the way that such applications are contemplated by the provisions of section 39 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department explained the reasons why the amendments differ from the Commercial Arbitration Act. Ms Bromley, the acting senior government counsel of the courts and tribunals branch, wrote to the committee chairman stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulty with allowing a party to apply directly to the Court is that parties to an arbitration may not be able to determine whether an issue in the arbitration is a question of law, particularly where parties are unrepresented. This may disrupt the arbitration proceedings, and potentially waste judicial time and resources . . . On the other hand, it is better to settle preliminary questions of law early than have the costs of arbitration wasted by proceeding with the arbitration on a doubtful or incorrect legal basis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The Law Council's second concern relates to the appeal provisions. The additional filtering mechanism applies only in determining preliminary points of law which arise during an arbitration. Proposed section 53AB of the Federal Court Act provides that, where the arbitration is complete and an award has been registered, a party to the award may apply to the court for a review, on a question of law, of the award. Under the uniform commercial arbitration legislation appeal is either with the consent of the parties or by leave of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council's overriding concern is that the lack of uniformity between the provisions for appeal of arbitration awards of questions of law in the uniform commercial arbitration legislation and in the Federal Court Act may lead to `forum shopping'. On this point, the proposed amendments do not alter the existing choice of forums for contract disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If parties to an agreement to which the uniform commercial arbitration legislation applies have a contractual dispute they can go to private arbitration or to the Federal Court if the dispute is also about a matter the court has jurisdiction over, for example trade practices or copyright. The proposed amendments are only another means of dispute resolution within the court for parties already taking court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill creates an appeal mechanism for proceedings that have been referred to arbitration. At present, no such mechanism exists. The bill enables a party to seek a review of an award on a question of law. Where the arbitration is not yet complete, a party can request the arbitrator to seek leave of the Federal Court for a review on a question of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concerns expressed on these provisions by the Law Council were canvassed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. These concerns relate to the lack of consistency between the provisions and the provisions of state commercial arbitration acts. The committee heard the Attorney-General's response to these concerns. No adverse comment was made by the committee with respect to the amendments. The coalition does not oppose these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Judiciary Act: the bill repeals section 77F(3) which confers a personal power on the Chief Justice of the High Court to issue commissions to persons authorising them to administer oaths and affirmations for the purposes of proceedings in the High Court. The exercise of this power ceased in 1972. Additional amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975: the bill removes gender-specific language from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a more controversial matter relating to the proposed amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 which were withdrawn. We observe that, although the government finally withdrew the provision, it does serve to illustrate the way in which the government thinks that there are certain matters with which it can get away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the Senate inserted a reading down provision which provides that, if a statutory provision could be read as having a particular application which would exceed Commonwealth power, and can be read as having a valid application, the parliament intended that the provision should have only the valid application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the High Court found the invalid applications of such provisions to be inseverable, and therefore has found such provisions wholly invalid. The proposed new section sought to provide that, if a provision in its application to a particular person, thing or circumstance et cetera would exceed Commonwealth power but would validly apply to another particular person, thing or circumstance, the parliament intended that the provision should not have the invalid application but should have the valid application. This is clearly not the way to solve the problem. The government should draft and pass clear, constitutionally valid legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would have changed legislation which has been interpreted to mean something contrary to that which it says. If the main point of the original legislation is to do one thing, but this is constitutionally invalid, the section may still survive on the statute book if it has another effect which is valid. While the courts would apply only the valid effect of the section, the statute book would tell the community a different story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of this proposed section would have been that the government would have been ignoring its own policy of plain English simplification legislation which is supposed to make the law more accessible to the people. This proposed amendment, while intended to cure badly drafted legislation, would have done so only by distorting its meaning in a way which was neither intended nor apparent from the face of the provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only after a degree of pressure did the government back down on this matter, probably as a result of the pressure created by the time frame in which we are operating.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee appreciates the prompt and generally supportive government response to its report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The workforce of the future</EMPHASIS>. However, the committee is concerned at a failure in the response to paragraph 2.31 to grasp the importance of developing an inventory of internationally recognised brand names. This is probably because the subject falls into the grey area between the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which coordinated the reply, and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 2.31 of the report is not about foreign investment except as an explanation for why Australia lacks an inventory of brand name goods other than wine, films, Akubra hats, RM Williams boots and Drizabone coats. Toyota Camry, IBM computers and Canon colour photocopiers are not names that automatically suggest an Australian product or encourage international consumers to show a preference for buying our goods in the way that consumers internationally look for Swedish brand names; for example, Volvo, Saab, SKF, Electrolux and Hasselblad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee rejects as a declaration of pessimism the response that it is more important for industry development that Australia become the `home base' of more firms than it is for Australia to develop an inventory of internationally recognised brand names and that Australia can best hope to be the vector of other countries' products locally produced, since we have no hope of doing for ourselves what Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland and Denmark have done in establishing a niche in world markets for quality products that are demonstrably their own. Would it seem rational to say to the Netherlands, `Give up Phillips, and become a home base for Sony', or to say to Sweden, `Give up Volvo, and invite GM to set up a home base', or to say to Switzerland, `Abandon the Nestle brand, and give up to Cadbury'?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation proposes to upgrade the Australian Language and Literacy Council from a committee to a fully fledged council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. The council provides advice to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training on priority strategies and targets for the development and implementation of all aspects of Australian language and literacy policy. If ever there was a time when a focus on literacy was needed, it is now. The Schools Council, also part of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, in a recent report found that up to 25 per cent of Australian children are battling literacy problems; that is 25 per cent of young kids are having problems with basic reading and writing skills. This is the result of 13 years of Labor policy on literacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I have seen from our consultations that such problems play a key role in truancy and can ultimately lead to unemployment. At a time of record youth unemployment, one wonders how forming a council will ever help Australian children overcome their problems; but it may be a start, and hopefully something will come from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because some children are experiencing literacy problems, they feel alienated. Not only do they stop attending school but some also end up in the unemployment queue. Given that we are looking at what the potential consequences of literacy problems can be, it would be beneficial to look at the sorts of levels of youth unemployment that we are talking about. As I stand at this dispatch box, Mr Deputy Speaker, 29 per cent of 15- to 19-year-olds nationally are unemployed. That is 143,400 young Australians looking for work. In the 20- to 24-year-old group, 274,500 young Australians are without a job. That is a total figure of 275,000 young Australians who are out of a job because of Labor's policies. The total official number of unemployed young people is equivalent to four times the population of the city of Launceston in Tasmania, three times the population of my own city, 2 3/4 times the population of the city of Townsville in Queensland and more than the population of the city of Newcastle in New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 comprises the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The 1993 federal election report of inquiry into the conduct of the federal election and matters related thereto</EMPHASIS>. I well recognise that all members in this place wish to go home, so I will make my remarks very brief. I am disappointed that the schedule of amendments agreed to by the Senate and returned to the House of Representatives tonight does not include the amendment relating to truth in advertising. I spoke at great length on that issue earlier this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the recommendations in the report of the joint standing committee, a bipartisan report, have been implemented. The amendments in this bill are largely technical and designed to improve the conduct of federal elections. The amendments deal with matters such as prisoner voting, conduct of electoral roll reviews, overseas electors, close of rolls, bulk nominations, interstate voting and procedures relating to the Court of Disputed Returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports the bill, and did have two amendments included within the bill. The government accepted the opposition's proposal that voters on the register of general postal voters be sent ballot papers as soon as they are received by the relevant DRO without the need to complete a postal vote application form. We record our appreciation of  the government's acceptance of this sensible reform, which will make it much easier for remote voters in particular to participate in elections. Hopefully it will help get us returned to the business side of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Minchin moved an amendment in relation to this issue which the government accepted, and we are pleased about that. Bill No. 2 originally sought to remove any restriction on the right of prisoners to enrol and vote. Following the coalition's opposition to this proposal and general community outrage, the government has withdrawn this unacceptable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current arrangements relating to prisoners are unworkable, in that the disqualification refers to the maximum possible penalty for the offence and not the actual sentence being served. The opposition welcomes the government's recognition of the need for some restriction on prisoner voting rights and that it should be based on actual sentence. However, the coalition believes the actual sentence which triggers a disqualification should be reduced from five years to 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that if someone commits an offence serious enough to carry a sentence of 12 months or more they should not be entitled to vote while in prison. Punishment for 12 months or more in prison should involve the loss of entitlement to vote for at least a year. The 12 months was in the Electoral Act before Labor came to office in 1983 and it is consistent with the period of imprisonment which disqualifies someone from being a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills unfortunately fail to address other electoral issues that the coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters referred to in their dissenting report on the 1993 election. The inquiry into the 1993 election revealed widespread concern about the integrity of our electoral system. Government and the AEC admit that our system of enrolment and voting is wide open to fraud and abuse, although they claim that in fact it is not being abused. However, they are not able to prove that it is not being rorted and they cannot prove that it is not systematic and endemic electoral fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition members of the joint standing committee recommended that, in order to increase the integrity of the system, individuals claiming entitlement to enrolment should be required to provide the AEC with proof of their identity together with evidence of their citizenship by production of a birth certificate, current passport or certificate of naturalisation. Coalition members also recommended that subdivisional voting be reintroduced, that the AEC trial a system of voter cards in a by-election and that section 245 of the Electoral Act, which compels electors to vote, be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has completely ignored the issue of electoral fraud and continues to preside over a system wide open to abuse. The government is negligent in its determination to ignore increasing community concern about the integrity of our electoral system and the fact that it is open to fraud and abuse. The coalition does not oppose this bill. The bill does not go nearly far enough in dealing with the problems in the electoral system identified in the joint standing committee's inquiry into the last election. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. However, Australian Air Express (AaE), a company owned jointly by Australia Post and Qantas, does provide a next day delivery service between Canberra and Perth suburbs, and will pick-up from customer's premises as late as 5pm each work day.

Australia Post's Express Post Parcel Service does not provide a guaranteed next day delivery to other than the CBD area of Perth because of airline timetable and operational constraints associated with providing customers with an Australia-wide reciprocal lodgment and delivery network. Costly, additional arrangements would be needed to extend the interstate Express Post network to include next day delivery to the whole of Perth, and this cost would have to be passed on directly to customers using this service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As indicated in (1), Australia Post's Express Post Parcel Service has a guaranteed next day interstate capability to Perth, but to the CBD area only. Prompt delivery on a non-guaranteed basis is given to Express Post articles posted to or from places outside the guaranteed network. The interstate delivery standard for such articles posted from Canberra to Perth suburbs is Day 2. However, as also indicated in (1), AaE provides for next day delivery from Canberra to Perth suburbs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (4) Australia Post offers basically three levels of service for parcels&mdash;by Road, which can take several days depending on the distance travelled; Express Post, which is a next day guaranteed, money back, service operating within a defined Australia-wide network; and AaE, which is designed specifically to meet urgent and overnight air freight customer needs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister of Industry, Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am aware of Professor Clarke's Brodie-Hall Address on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Biological Resources, Technology and the Future of Australia</EMPHASIS> on 16 October 1995 and of its report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> the following day, that is 17 October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Agreements governing the commercialisation of new discoveries are made with overseas interests when such arrangements offer the maximum available return to Australia on the originating research. This usually occurs where the scale of finance or the technical and commercial expertise required for commercialisation do not reside within Australia. Australia seeks to maximise the returns in such circumstances through equity based partnerships and/or appropriate licensing arrangements&mdash;as is common practice for most technologically advanced economies of comparable size to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does not normally forfeit access to those of its technologies commercialised abroad. Patent licensing and collaborative arrangements protect Australia's interests in these technologies, while Australian researchers are entitled to conduct further research on them and protect the resulting improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As an example of overseas ownership of emerging technologies, Professor Clarke referred to the importation of chicken germplasm. Industry sources advise that within the last 2 years, fertilised chicken eggs have been brought into Australia under quarantine, mainly from Scandinavia and the UK.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This egg importation ensures an adequate supply of suitable material for the poultry industry and royalties in respect of the chickens are paid as part of the commercial agreements. According to industry sources, the royalties are paid on less than half the total flock and are estimated to be less than 1 cent per bird&mdash;substantially less than the 2.5 cents indicated in the newspaper reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that these eggs have been bred and produced by standard breeding techniques, are not biotechnological products and have been imported to maintain breeding stocks. I am also advised that many Australian breeders continue to use their own stocks, breeding them in the same standard way and without these royalty payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Government's policies are directed, amongst other things, at enhancing the capacity of Australian industries to invest in and exploit core technologies developed in Australia. Relevant programs include the tax concession for R&amp;D, Competitive Grants for R&amp;D, Concessional Loans for Commercialisation of Technological Innovation, the Australian Technology Group, Pooled Development Funds, the Development and Application of Technology in Industry Program, the AusIndustry suite of business advisory service and networking programs, the National Technology Access and Diffusion Network, the Pharmaceutical Industry Development Program, the Computer Bounty, the Information Technology Development Program, the Partnerships for Development and Fixed Term Arrangement Program, the Telecommunications Industry Development Plans, the Marine Science and Technology Program, and the National Space Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Policy is also directed at bringing public sector research, the major source of core technology development, into closer alignment with Australian industry development opportunities so as to maximise its chances of commercialisation in Australia. Relevant initiatives include the performance indicators negotiated with research agencies under their Triennium Funding Agreements, including external earnings targets, the Cooperative Research Centres Program, the presence of a commercialisation arm in almost every university, and the direction of certain Australian Research Council programs to fostering industry linkages with higher education research and research training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These specific policies operate in the context of phased reductions in industry protection, the deregulation of the financial market, and a comprehensive agenda for microeconomic reform, which together are bringing about a restructuring of Australian industry towards high value added manufacturing and services. Such restructuring is essential to creating an environment in which Australian developed core technologies will be commercialised by Australian industry.</PARA>

In recognition of this, in the 1995 Budget I was given increased flexibility to ensure that my Department can manage the funding of labour market programs to ensure that assistance is provided as, and where, it is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of activity in individual programs depends on case managers' decisions at the local level about the types of assistance required by their clients. Some programs (eg New Work Opportunities) are based on advice from Area Consultative Committees. Various programs can be linked to provide group or individual packages. Any projected figures for 1995-96, the remainder of 1995, or 1996 attached to individual programs at this stage would, therefore, have little meaning.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr Lee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government has in place measures to encourage the co-location of telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Telecommunications National Code, carriers are required to co-locate new facilities (towers or similar structures) on towers unless it is not technically feasible; is incompatible with the network configuration; or is likely to have a greater adverse effect on the environment than putting a new facility in another place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, under the Telecommunications National Code, carriers are required, among other things, to take all reasonable steps to use existing sites and facilities used by public utilities to supply products or services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Telecommunications (General Telecommunications Licences) Declaration (No. 1) of 1991, made under the Telecommunications Act 1991, requires carriers to provide other carriers with access to specified infrastructure including ducts that were in place on 30 June 1991, if it is reasonable to do so. Carriers are also required to provide access to this infrastructure where it was acquired on any basis other than full commercial negotiation, if it is reasonable to do so. This access is on terms and conditions, as agreed from time to time by the carriers, or failing agreement, as determined by AUSTEL under the Telecommunications (Interconnection and Related Charging Principles) Determination No 1 of 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am advised that Telstra owns the conduits carrying Telstra's telecommunications cabling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am advised by Telstra that the size of conduits varies. Older suburbs can have conduits as narrow as 20 millimetres. Generally suburban conduit is around 50 millimetres in diameter. Wider streets tend to have wider conduit because they carry the bulk of cables, while side streets require only smaller branch-like conduits of 50 millimetres. In newer estates conduit tends to be 80 to 100 millimetres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am advised by Optus that the full range of services offered by Optus&mdash;local telephony, pay television and interactive services&mdash;will be mostly offered through a single 17 millimetre cable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) As indicated in answer to question (1), carriers are required to allow access to their conduits where reasonable. I am advised by Telstra that Optus has approximately 1000 kilometres of its telephony cable in Telstra's underground network. Shared underground placement of telephony cable had been mostly in trunk routes where large pipes for inter-exchange links or CBD loops lead to space being available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that there are reasons why it may not be feasible for carriers to share conduits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there is often not enough room in existing conduit to introduce new cabling. I am advised that, for example, in undertaking its major upgrade of underground conduit, Telstra will have to expand approximately 50 per cent of conduit ducting. Secondly, space may need to be retained to enable effective maintenance. Thirdly, insertion of new cable in conduits where there is insufficient space may damage existing cable. Carriers may also wish to retain spare space for growth in their own network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The decision whether cable is installed overhead via power poles or underground is a commercial one for the carriers, subject to the carriers' deployment abiding by relevant Commonwealth legislation (including in particular Part 7 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 and the Telecommunications National Code).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Government in establishing its telecommunications regime in 1991 put in place a regime which would enable carriers to compete with each other on an equal basis in providing telecommunications networks and services. This regime included basic rights of interconnection between carriers and rights of access. This enables carriers to interconnect with each other's networks and to share infrastructure when provision of additional infrastructure is considered commercially undesirable. Within this environment, it is a commercial decision for carriers how they deploy their networks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8)(a) I am advised by Optus that it has undertaken a significant community information program in the areas in which it deploys its cable network. The program involves individual contact with each household. Optus has advised that research indicates that opposition decreases once the community becomes aware of the full benefits of the network, including an alternative competitive local telephone services and access to the superhighway of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Carriers when rolling out cable for their network are required to comply with the Telecommunications National Code. The Code establishes procedures whereby environmental, heritage and development issues can be adequately considered. The Code requires that carriers notify relevant authorities including local government, and provide them with details, of the carriers' proposed cabling rollout activities (underground or overhead).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Such consultations with Local Government organisations are provided for under the Telecommunications National Code to enable consultation with local communities. The degree to which local government expresses concerns and the time taken to address these concerns may vary. However, to ensure that there cannot be indefinite delays to the carriers' network roll-out the Code provides for an upper limit on the period of consultation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The matter raises issues under the Trade Practices Act 1974 which have been considered by the Trade Practices Commission. The successor of the Trade Practices Commission, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (the ACCC), has advised that the conduct in question could fall for consideration under section 47 of the Trade Practices Act. Section 47 prohibits a corporation from engaging in exclusive dealing but only if the conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially lessening competition in the relevant market. The ACCC has formed the view that, given the large number of legal firms whose services are available in the Sydney region, it would seem unlikely that an exclusive dealing arrangement involving 43 firms would substantially lessen competition and, therefore, the conduct in question would be unlikely to contravene the Act. In this regard, I note that, while the matter to which you have referred made it difficult for the resident group to obtain legal assistance to challenge an action of the telecommunications corporation, it appears that legal assistance eventually became available to the group.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr Lavarch</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised by the ASC that it is aware of the 1995 annual report of the Hills Motorway Group. The ASC has provided the following comments concerning the items mentioned in the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The interest expenses of $8.99 million from THM Limited to the Trust had been capitalised and shown under leasehold improvement at notes 9 and l(e). Therefore they were not shown in the profit and loss account of THM Limited. Capitalised expenditure is to be amortised when the motorway becomes operational. This accounting treatment is considered to be proper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Provided that all these expenses can be directly related to the project and that they are not overvalued, it is appropriate to capitalise them. Capitalised expenses will have to be amortised once the motorway starts receiving income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Prepaid interest should properly be shown as an asset on the balance sheet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) In the abridged aggregated financial statements of the group set out in the annual report, the non-current liability due by THM Limited to the Trust had been eliminated in order to show the position of the Group. This is intended to reflect the substance of the transaction from the investors' point of view. The abridged aggregated accounts are for the unit holders/shareholders' information only and have no standing under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) The cash flow statement shows that the amount in question has been paid by THM Limited. Among the $47.7 million, $8.99 million was shown as revenue in the profit and loss account of the Trust and the balance was shown as unearned income on the Trust's balance sheet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) Based on information provided in the financial statements, this is the net worth of the company. The ASC is not aware of any improper accounting treatments which would affect the net worth of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am advised by the ASC that the accounting treatment of the sum $37.5 million as an asset item is independent of the liabilities of the company. Prepayments are an asset. The non-current liabilities referred to are not brought to account in the abridged aggregated financial statements as explained in answer to l(d).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am advised by the ASC that, in the absence of any further information, it would rely on the accounts provided by the directors and audited by Ernst &amp; Young, which do not indicate negative net worth. The ASC further advises that, at this stage, it has not received any information which causes it to require further substantiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am advised by the ASC that information to the effect suggested was provided in the accounts of THM Limited and the Trust as related party disclosures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) I am advised by the ASC that, in relation to the M2 Motorway project generally, THM Limited is responsible for supervising the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the M2 Motorway, while the Trustee is the sole borrower for the project and finances the project. The Trust receives rent from THM Limited in the form of sub-lease payments and makes interest and principal payments on the project debt, pays Trust expenses and makes distributions to investors. Under the terms of the Project Funding Deed entered into by the Trustee, THM Limited and Hills Motorway Construction Company Pty Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of THM Limited), all monies received by the Trust and by THM Limited are required to be deposited in accounts established in compliance with the Deed. The Agent, Westpac Banking Corporation, is then required to make certain withdrawals and transfers between the accounts. The rights of all other parties to operate the accounts are restricted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any payments made by Perpetual Trustee Limited would have been made as trustee of the Trust. Such payments would be made only on the basis of a recommendation by the Manager of the Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the structure in place for this project, the transfer of monies between the Trust and THM Limited would be expected. Based on the information currently available, the ASC has advised that it has no reason to believe that any expenses have been improperly paid or have not been paid in accordance with the various agreements, including the Project Funding Deed and the Trust Deed establishing the Trust. It would appear that no inappropriate payments have been identified by either the auditor or the Trustee of the Trust. Accordingly, in the absence of any suspected contravention of the Corporations Law, the ASC would not propose to investigate the matter at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) I am advised by the ASC that nothing has come to its attention which would suggest that either the prospectus for the M2 motorway project contained any material breach of the Corporations Law or that any of the companies associated with the project have committed any breach of the Corporations Law with respect to the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The ASC has provided the following comments concerning the items mentioned in the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The amount of $8.99 million was shown at page 42 of the Trust account. The amount has been recognised in THM Limited's accounts as explained at 1(a).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Unless there is information that the loan will be wholly or partly uncollectible, there is no reason for provision for diminution in value to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The full amount for property, plant and equipment was related to leasehold improvement. It will not be amortised or depreciated until the motorway is finished and starts operating. It would not be proper to amortise this item until income commences when income and expenses can be matched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The ASC's attention has been drawn to the inclusion of borrowing costs and preliminary expenses of $26.05 million as an asset in the Trust, the treatment of which would appear to be appropriate. The distribution to unit holders of $9 million included $8.99 million interest income of the Trust, which does not have to be deducted from unit holders' equity. The balance of the distribution has been deducted from the unit holders' equity. The issue price of units in the trust was 99 cents, although the net asset backing for each stapled security (that is, one share in THM Limited and one unit in the Hills Motorway Trust) was estimated in the prospectus to be 83 cents. The value, on the basis of net asset backing, for units in the Trust was not shown as 99 cents. The Trust is now a listed Trust and the value of the stapled securities is determined by the market. As the market trades the stapled securities and not units in the Trust and shares in THM Limited separately, the market does not ascribe a separate value for the units in the Trust and the shares. Each set of financial statements will provide information regarding the net asset backing for units in the Trust and shares in the company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) I am advised by the ASC that it is apparent from the audited trust accounts that the borrowings at 30 June 1995 did not exceed 80% of the gross assets. The ASC is not aware of any instances where the borrowing limit has been exceeded. In accordance with the Trust Deed, should that limit be exceeded, the Manager of the Trust is obliged to notify the Trustee that this has occurred and take appropriate steps to remedy the default as soon as possible. On the basis of the information before it, the ASC has no reason to believe that either the Manager or the Trustee has failed to comply with its obligations under the Trust Deed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. I am also advised that the ASC is aware of the matters outlined in part 1 of the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. I am also advised that the ASC is not aware of any specific claims that the projections referred to in part 1 were incorrect at the time they were made. The ASC is aware of and has considered the fact that the results for the financial year ended 30 June 1995 for NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited were at variance with the projections for that period contained in the prospectus dated 23 August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) It is not clear from the question who is supposed to have established these matters. However, I will answer the question on the assumption that it is asking whether the ASC has established these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the ASC is not aware of the internal reporting structures of NRMA. The ASC is aware that the Boards of NRMA Limited and NRMA Insurance Limited meet monthly and is aware that reports by management on performance are presented at those meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I am advised that the information on page 57 of the prospectus for NRMA dated 23 August 1994 consists of a summarised consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 1994 based on the audited accounts at that date and a pro forma consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 1994. The pro forma balance sheet as at 30 June 1994 was based on the audited 31 March 1994 balance sheet and then adjusted for a number of items which are summarised on page 58 of the prospectus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) I am advised that the answer is yes. I am advised that the basis used for estimating the market value of the shares at approximately $2.00 per share is detailed on page 28 of the prospectus. The estimated price was calculated as if NRMA Holdings had been listed on the Australian Stock Exchange at 30 June 1994. The prospectus says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The total market value is calculated with reference to the multiple of reported net tangible assets (at 31 December 1993) of the companies which comprised the Insurance Index at 30 June 1994 and with reference to the forecast 1994/1995 price earnings multiples of those companies. Share prices at 30 June 1994 were used in calculating these multiples."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This indicates that the NRMA had reference to the multiple to net tangible assets and the price/earnings multiples of other insurance companies in assessing the estimated total market value of NRMA Holdings Limited and consequently the estimated market value of NRMA shares. The pro forma balance sheet for NRMA Holdings Limited was then used to provide the net tangible asset value of $1.72 per share and the basis for a market value which was estimated at a market capitalisation of 1.17 times net tangible assets, or $2.00 per share, as shown at page 28 of the prospectus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) This is a question which asks for an opinion or exercise of judgement. However, I am advised that the consolidated profit after income tax for the nine months ended 31 March 1994 is shown in the table set out on page 64 of the prospectus to be consistent, on a proportional basis, with the corresponding item for the years ended 30 June 1992 and 30 June 1993. The estimated consolidated profit after income tax for the full year ended 30 June 1994, which is set out on page 52 of the prospectus, is substantially less than the consolidated profits after tax for either of the years ended 30 June 1992 or 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospectus states: "The forecast for the NRMA for 1994/1995 is based on budgets prepared by management as part of the usual budgeting process and adopted by the directors of NRMA Holdings."  The profit forecast was based on a number of assumptions outlined in the prospectus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) $1,589,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) $1,650,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes, a former employee did allege mismanagement. AusAID's considerations were based on the findings of an independent audit by BDO Nelson Parkhill, submitted on 25 March 1995, which did not generally substantiate the allegations. The AusAID grant for AESOP in 1995-96 was therefore same real, ie. the same money amount as 1994-95 year plus inflation. The payment to AESOP is made in two tranches. Payment of the second tranche in 1995-96 is dependent on the AESOP Board addressing satisfactorily the issues raised in the audit report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As indicated in the previous answer, the AESOP grant for 1995-96 was held at the same real level. (a) The independent auditors report indicated that there were some breaches of the grant agreement between AusAID and AESOP but that AESOP did have adequate systems and procedures to account for Government grants. (b) The Volunteer Programs Effectiveness Review of all four volunteer agencies funded through the aid program, including AESOP, commenced in July 1995. No prejudgment of the outcomes was made in allocating funds to AESOP for 1995-96. (c) AESOP did provide AusAID with details of its 1995-96 program. A high level budget consultation between both parties took place prior to any grant payments. (d) Refer to answer (c).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. There appears to be no standard criteria to judge whether grantee bodies such as AESOP spend an appropriate ratio of funds on program and administrative expenses. The bottom line for assessing cost-effectiveness would appear to be the cost per placement and the ratio of employees to placements. Based on figures provided by AESOP, obtained at a recent international meeting in Paris of similar agencies, the unit cost per placement for AESOP is USD4,128, for the British agency USD4,242, the Germans USD6,495 and the Canadians USD9,458. AESOP has 19.8 placements for every employee, the British 17, the Canadians 13 and the Germans 9. AusAID is not presently in a position to validate these figures, but its Effectiveness Review is attempting to provide an objective basis to compare agency performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The audit report will be made available to the public together with the report of the follow-up audit which is to commence in November 1995 to examine AESOP's response to and implementation of each of the recommendations contained in the audit report dated 24 March 1995. The report of the Volunteer Programs Effectiveness Review will also be made available to the public.</PARA>

The representative advised he was most impressed by the enthusiasm of the clients regarding the proposed projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) AESOP advises that volunteers were despatched to undertake 4 of the 5 projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) AESOP advises that:  (a) The Royal Express Company, Travel Agency Management assignment was from 22/8/94-29/8/94. This was a preliminary assignment as a suitably qualified volunteer was passing through Thailand on personal business at the time and agreed to assist. He spent one week with the company. The cost to AESOP for fares and incidentals was $221.00. The project was to be followed up by a full assignment at a later date, however this did not occur. (b) The Jommanee Royal Company Limited, Hotel Management assignment was from 5/8/94-29/10/94. (c) The Jommanee Royal Company Limited, Food and Beverage Management assignment was from 3/9/94-11/11/94. (d) The ESAN Institute of Training and Development, Education Administration project did not proceed. (e) The ESAN Institute of Training and Development, Computer Training assignment was from 18/8/94-9/9/94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) AESOP advises that:  (a) In a letter to the Operations Manager of AESOP in October 1994, the volunteer who undertook the Hotel Management task advised that the two offices at the back of the travel agency premises were being used for cosmetic surgery under the direction of Dr Nantachai Jiyasak (one of the client Directors). He further advised that patients entered through the travel agency, indicating that the agency was still in operation. Prior to this, one of the offices was used infrequently as a meeting room. (b) The volunteer reported as quoted in the question. He also reported that the hotel had no existing profit and loss account and he introduced and trained staff in accounting procedures. The volunteer also persuaded the owners not to build proposed extensions as he saw these as not being viable. He also changed staffing levels and introduced multi skilling in some areas. (c) Although the volunteer had some problems with the owner, he reports the staff were trained in western style food preparation and serving, new menus were printed in Thai and English, dishes were accurately costed, and training was given in speaking and writing English. He further reports, staff results were commensurate with their learning abilities. (d) Yes. While the project had much merit and was strongly supported by AESOP, the Institute was shelved due to lack of funds. (e) No. The computer training project did not proceed as planned as there were problems with the ESAN Institute of Training and Development. The volunteer then taught English as a Second Language at the Jommanee Royal Company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Yes. AESOP advises that the statement submitted by the client in support of the application indicated that the Institute was intended to provide vocational training to Nong Khai and surrounding provinces plus students from Laos. It was intended that the AESOP volunteers would train local staff who would then assume responsibility for the operation of the Institute. This proposal fitted AESOP guidelines and development philosophy closely and was therefore supported.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) Yes. AESOP advises that two volunteers were despatched, one to undertake the financial management, accounting systems and computer systems projects and another to undertake the beef cattle project.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) AESOP advises that during the period of recruiting volunteers for the projects referred to in part 14, the Hong Kong partner of the Thai business withdrew its support for the venture. This information was not made available to AESOP prior to the dispatch to Thailand of the volunteer carrying out the 3 projects. On receipt of this information, all 3 projects were terminated immediately and the volunteer repatriated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) AESOP advises that a search of it's records has failed to locate a report in the terms referred to in part 18. The project was terminated on the advice that the client company was experiencing difficulties. The overall result in the country representative's final report assessed the outcome as being very poor but advised there had been some minor training of the farm manager. The volunteer's final report indicates that overall there was a good result and the project led to introduction of new procedures, and improvements in  morale, savings and product quality. The volunteer also reported that he had provided advice to neighbouring farmers on a range of issues.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) Yes. AESOP advises that the volunteer assigned to assist with factory management also reported: "Overall the consultant [the volunteer] has concluded that it [the project] was justified in that advice has now been given on further steps that the client management should take to make the essential changes for improved company operation." He went on to state that the client's "current management is/was so unprofessional, even naive, that the help provided by AESOP has probably been of value to them to identify their needs and deficiencies so that they can now take appropriate actions to achieve their newly defined objectives."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(22) (a)  Yes. The Industrial Engineer who undertook the first assignment reported that the second assignment had been unacceptable to the client, but, AESOP advises, the Banker who actually carried out the second assignment on financial systems and management  advised he did have client support and was satisfied with his results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Yes. However, AESOP advises that the Industrial Chemist who actually carried out the third assignment on fish net dyeing advised he did have client support, that savings were made, and product quality was improved.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(24) AESOP advises that management considered the reports of the volunteers and the country representative for each project. It was found that there had been some differences of opinion and even friction between the AESOP volunteers during the projects. It is now policy to send multi-disciplinary teams only in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(25) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(26) Yes. AESOP advises that, from the correspondence received from the client and the reports of the volunteer and the AESOP representative in Thailand, it is apparent that the client wanted the volunteer to act in a management role, rather than that of an adviser as described in the project proposal. Difficulties arose and the project was ultimately terminated by the client. Despite the difficulties, irrigation and hydroponic systems were redesigned and production management papers issued to staff. Recommendations on the future direction of the company were also made to the client.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(27) AESOP advises that the actual duration was 15/3/94 to 16/6/94. The original request had been for the period 15/3/94&mdash;8/6/94. The extension of the project was requested by the client.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(28) No. AESOP advises that based on the average cost per project over the two years to June 1994, the cost of the 13 projects mentioned previously would have been in the region of $97,500. One project did not proceed, however, one project was completed without any expenditure on international air fares, and three projects were combined into one. The actual cost would therefore be in the order of $70,000. The success of the projects varied. Most had some positive outcomes, as can be seen from previous answers to questions. During the period covered by the projects mentioned in the preceding parts, 29 projects were undertaken in Thailand. Most volunteers reported satisfactory results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(29) Yes. AESOP advises that representational arrangements vary from country to country as do in-country costs. Responsibilities also vary from country to country. In some countries, representatives are employees of Australian companies which bear the cost of providing a point of representation for AESOP. Representation arrangements are continuously under review to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place in every country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No. The Government has consistently taken the view that the implication of the decisions of a majority of the judges in Mabo (No. 2) is that valid pastoral leases extinguished native title. However, it has also taken the approach that the most appropriate course is for the issue to be finally determined in the courts. In this way, indigenous parties and others can present material and fully argue the issue and the common law principles governing the recognition and extinguishment of native title can be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not appropriate to pre-empt this judicial consideration by legislative action. Nor is it necessary to provide protection for pastoralists: any doubts about the validity of pre-1994 pastoral leases have been removed by the Native Title Act 1993 and that Act clearly allows for the extension, renewal and re-grant of pastoral leases after they expire, even if some residual native title rights have survived. Mining on pastoral leases can take place by following the `right to negotiate' regime.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) That the Constitution and laws of the United States contain extensive protections of individual freedom of speech, expression and association. Accordingly, the United States does not accept any obligation under this Convention, in particular under articles 4 and 7, to restrict those rights, through the adoption of legislation or any other measures, to the extent that they are protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) That the Constitution and laws of the United States establish extensive protections against discrimination, reaching significant areas of non-governmental activity. Individual privacy and freedom from governmental interference in private conduct, however, are also recognised as among the fundamental values which shape our free and democratic society. The United States understands that the identification of the rights protected under the Convention by reference in article 1 to fields of `public life' reflects a similar distinction between spheres of public conduct that are customarily the subject of governmental regulation, and spheres of private conduct that are not. To the extent, however, that the Convention calls for a broader regulation of private conduct, the United States does not accept any obligation under this Convention to enact legislation or take other measures under paragraph (1) of article 2, subparagraphs (1)(c) and (d) of article 2, article 3 and article 5 with respect to private conduct except as mandated by the Constitution and laws of the United States.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The expressions "private access roads", "at the place where the mining operation is carried on" and "exploration" found in the definition of "mining operations", are not themselves defined in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1995. Therefore, these expressions are to be construed in the context of the legislation and are to take on their ordinary English meanings, unless a Court has decided, as a matter of law, that a particular expression should carry a technical meaning and not the ordinary meaning. There have been no Court decisions on the expressions to this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian Customs Service is responsible for the administration of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and is therefore solely responsible for the giving of advice on the interpretation of terms or expressions contained in the legislation. The Department of Industry, Science and Technology does not give advice to beneficiaries of the Scheme on such matters and therefore, there have not been conflicting advices.</PARA>
