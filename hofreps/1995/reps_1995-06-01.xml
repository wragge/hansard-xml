<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The committee's seventh report of 1995 relates to the proposed construction of a multi-level car park for the Federal Airports Corporation at Melbourne airport. Melbourne airport is the second busiest in Australia and is subject to continuing growth in passenger movements. The existing short-term car park is suffering severe congestion and frequent closure. The Federal Airports Corporation submitted to the committee that it is necessary to increase the capacity of the short-term car park by providing a multi-level car park adjacent to the terminal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the proposal examined by the committee includes a four-level, open-sided concrete car park. It also includes associated facilities such as office accommodation for car rental companies and police, accommodation for some high vehicles, lifts, stairs, pedestrian bridges, goods loading dock, landscaping and planting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preliminary cost estimate of the project is $55 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed. The committee found that current short-term carparking facilities and arrangements at Melbourne airport are inadequate. There is a need to upgrade short-term car parking to overcome current shortages and provide for future growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a suggestion from the Public Transport Users Association that improved public transport from the airport to the city may obviate the need for a new building, the committee found that the majority of motor vehicles requiring short-term parking emanate from the wider metropolitan area and other parts of the state. The committee notes, nevertheless, that options for a longer term future rail link to the central business district have been identified and easements are being protected. Because the new car park will be some distance from the terminal building and will be linked by three walkways, the committee has recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation should consider the provision of mechanical moving walkways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A substantial building site between the terminal and the car park has been reserved for a future hotel. The committee has some misgivings about the suitability and practicality of locating a hotel between the terminal and the car park. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Federal Airports Corporation should re-examine the arrangement of car park and future hotel sites to satisfy itself that the proposed sites are the best locations for both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two features of the car park include a loading dock and tunnel, which it is planned will facilitate the movement of goods to and from the terminal. Qantas raised a number of concerns about the tunnel and the loading dock, and the committee has recommended that, during the development of detailed designs, the Federal Airports Corporation should continue discussions with Qantas and other terminal users about the functionality of the loading dock and tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same vein, in response to a submission from the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigades Board, the committee has recommended that the FAC should, during design development, consult the brigade about modifications to state regulatory fire safety requirements before they are submitted to the Building Appeals Board for approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's eighth report of 1995 deals with a proposed housing development at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coonawarra</EMPHASIS>, Northern Territory. The proposal examined by the committee involves the construction of 32 family dwellings by the Defence Housing Authority on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coonawarra</EMPHASIS>. The site for the proposed housing is adjacent to existing family units which have been completed over the past two years. Upon completion, the new houses will be allocated to families of army non-commissioned and commissioned officers. Included in the project are supporting community facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated cost of the proposed work is $6.8 million. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed. The committee concluded that, as a consequence of the army presence in the north project, there will be a need for a continuing program of housing acquisitions or Defence Housing Authority sponsored new construction to be provided in Darwin to cater for planned relocation of Defence personnel. The committee found that, in order to reduce reliance on temporary rental allowances and to avoid over-reliance on acquisitions, there is merit in the Defence Housing Authority proceeding with the funding and development of the new construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory government pointed out to the committee that the site proposed for the housing development is prone to noise from a number of sources, including aircraft, speedway racing and road traffic. The committee is not convinced that a housing subdivision, situated in close proximity to two major roads and within a short distance from a speedway and underneath an aircraft flight path, will not have substantial noise problems either now or in the near future. The committee raised these concerns with the Defence Housing Authority and has approved the proposal only on the assurance by the DHA that, whilst recognising the potential disadvantages, they are outweighed by the advantages. The committee remains to be convinced of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also raised concerns about the close proximity of the houses. They share one television between five houses. The committee raised the question of the payment of subcontractors with the Defence Housing Authority. The Defence Housing Authority is considering making it mandatory for builders to certify that these payments have been made. The committee believes this is an urgent matter and has recommended that the Defence Housing Authority should move swiftly to make it a mandatory requirement. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 1995 formally places before parliament, as required by law, a tariff alteration made by notice published in the Commonwealth <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> on 31 March 1995 during the recent recess of parliament. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 1995 is operative on and from 1 April 1995. Customs tariff rates of duty have been subjected to a graduated phasing regime since July 1988. This government is aware of the consequences to industry of sudden and large reductions in the customs duty impost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blood packs and blood pack systems used for collecting, processing, storing and administering blood and blood components have traditionally been classified by the Australian Customs Service as infusion and transfusion sets for blood and other fluids and currently subject to 10 per cent duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This classification was successfully challenged in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, with the result that the AAT set aside the customs classification, considering the goods to be properly classified to a duty free item.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment reinstates the level of assistance for the subject goods by specifically providing for blood packs and blood pack systems used for collecting, processing, storing and administering blood and blood components in the tariff classification that customs originally considered appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends four acts dealing with superannuation for Commonwealth sector civilian employees: the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1994. It also removes gender specific terms from the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the bill is to make amendments to continue the process of ensuring that the two superannuation schemes for Commonwealth civilian employees comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and regulations under that act. I expect the boards of trustees of the two schemes to elect that the schemes become regulated superannuation funds under SI(S) with effect from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also make some technical amendments to the acts to name the schemes, the boards of trustees and the funds as the commonwealth superannuation scheme and the public sector superannuation scheme, the CSS and PSS boards and the CSS and PSS funds. This will ensure that the generally used names have a legal basis and will enable ease of reference in other legislation. The opportunity has also been taken to include amendments to correct anomalies that have arisen and caused inequities&mdash;for example, to provide restoration of an invalidity pension that had been cancelled on a return to work that is terminated in the probationary period because of ill health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes amendments to restore the original intentions of the 1976 act as a response to the changing employment conditions in the public sector. For example, the change to the definition of minimum retiring age in that act formally recognises that most members of the scheme are able to retire from age 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also included are some amendments to assist administrative efficiency. For example, the boards will be able to rely on advice from employers rather than have to check personnel records for over 200,000 members. These amendments will not prevent the boards from correcting errors in such information nor interfere with members' appeal rights. The bill includes several technical amendments and drafting corrections resulting from previous amendments and to remove gender specific terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the financial impact of the bill. The amendments to correct anomalies will increase the cost of the schemes slightly. Most of the provisions designed to assist administration efficiency will decrease administrative costs, or prevent increases in such costs. A further administrative amendment will reduce the cost of the CSS but not the overall cost to the Commonwealth as there will be an offsetting compensation cost. Because the anomalies occur only in unusual situations, it is likely that there would be no overall cost to the schemes or the Commonwealth from the proposed amendments. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 is essentially amending legislation, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has outlined the details of it to some degree. It amends four acts dealing with Commonwealth sector civilian employees to ensure that the Commonwealth superannuation arrangements comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, otherwise known as the SI(S) legislation. It also covers regulations under that act. It corrects some anomalies. It restores the original intentions of certain provisions. It removes gender specific terms and makes technical and drafting changes to improve the administrative efficiency of the schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SI(S) requires that the trustees of public sector superannuation schemes should elect that the schemes become regulated under SI(S) from 1 July of this year. Amendments to the act are to take effect from that date. The bill also includes various other formal amendments to related legislation. This legislation does give us the opportunity to explore in greater detail the substance of the government's policy in terms of superannuation and to draw to the attention of the parliament those shortcomings which are quite evident in the policy for anyone, except members of the government, who wish to examine them in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The genesis of the current superannuation policy dates back to 1982 when the former government established a task force, of which I was the chairman, to examine a whole range of fundamental changes to superannuation throughout both the public and private sectors of Australia. Subsequently, following the loss of the 1983 election, this work was continued by the incoming Labor government under the then Treasurer, who is now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In June of that year, 1983, the first major changes were introduced to establish a new regime for superannuation. It is fair to say that the work undertaken by my committee initially did have some relevance to that outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years since then, we have seen a plague of changes to superannuation law in this country. In fact it is estimated that there have been over 2,000 substantial changes to superannuation law and regulations with the result that the community at large has found very great difficulty in absorbing this rate of change. Certainly the industry has reached a stage where it simply cannot take any more. In a sense, this is sad because in my view&mdash;and I have said this to industry on a number of occasions&mdash;we have created a situation where, by and large, those who should be involved in the development of superannuation policy in the industry have had to spend most of their time and resources simply responding to the initiatives introduced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the industry has tended to become very reactive in its approach to superannuation planning and design and has left most of the initiatives in the hands of the bureaucrats and advisers to the government. I think this is a shortcoming which needs to be addressed and needs to be addressed very soon. In an area which is as complex as superannuation planning, in an area which is going to have enormous impact on the capacity of domestic savings to increase over time, with all the economic implications associated with that, equally as important is the need for the industry as a whole to be in a position where it can be proactive to the need for change and be in a position to go to government on occasions and put forward proposals for policy changes which are clearly to the benefit of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point in the context of a very changing community. The basis of the current superannuation policy is well and truly found in the traditional lifestyle of an Australia which, regrettably, has now passed. The principle which the government takes for granted in relation to long-term superannuation savings is that people will go into the work force at about 18 to 20; they will stay there for about 45 years; they will never lose their jobs; they will never get divorced; they will never have any kids; they will never get sick; they will never need retraining; their income will continue to rise inexorably throughout that period; and, glory of all glories, at the age of 65 or so they will finally get their gold watch and go into retirement with a substantial nest egg. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure you, Mr Speaker, and members of this House that unfortunately that is not the reality of life today for any of us. In that context it is clear that you need to have a much more flexible approach to long-term saving and also to intermediate saving. The point has been made by ACOSS on a number of occasions recently, and I think correctly, that the emphasis in the government's whole proposal has essentially been to introduce as close to a universal system as possible, which may have the advantage in terms of macro-savings policy but equally carries with it the significant disadvantage that you are reducing the take-home pay and thus the disposable income potential of a substantial proportion of low to middle income earning Australians in the guise of saying to the Australian people, `When you retire don't worry; everything will be wonderful. You will be going out with a substantial sum of money.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole base of the government's approach to this came out manifestly clearly in the Prime Minister's claim at the time of the last budget that the latest proposed changes to superannuation will see every retiree sailing off into the sunset with a minimum of $460,000. According to the Treasury's own estimates, to achieve that glorious amount a contributor would have to enter the work force&mdash;the mythical concept I spoke of earlier&mdash;in seven years time at the age of 25 and work full time on average wages for at least 40 years, and that is after the year 2002. Consequently, unless you are currently under 18 and can avoid any lengthy period out of the work force, the likelihood of you achieving anywhere near this mythical figure of $460,000 is, to say the least, highly dubious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again this is an example of how the Prime Minister tends to make an art form of using case studies such as this, which are at best the particular, and applying them to the general. It is my task before the House today to demonstrate that that is not the basis of a sensible long-term planning approach to superannuation, nor is it a policy which is necessarily going to be to the advantage of those very same people who the Prime Minister claims will have $460,000 at some stage in the future. The evident weakness of this approach is that, unless you are in your early 20s, in the foreseeable future you will be worse off under the government's proposed scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has effectively done is to mix the benefits of a national savings strategy, which no-one would dispute. Australia must reach a situation where its domestic savings profile is significantly better than it has been over recent years. Under this government the numbers have fallen, contrary to what the general impression may be. Domestic savings under the last 12 years of Labor have been appalling. It has only been in the last couple of years that we have seen effectively a one per cent increase to about 17 per cent of GDP from where it was before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This point was made very clear by the economic consultant Vince FitzGerald, who advised some two years ago in a major government report on Australia's national savings that they had fallen to their lowest level this century. He excluded from that, of course, the Great Depression and both world wars. For most of the post-war period national savings were around 23 per cent of gross domestic product. By 1991-92 that had fallen to 16 per cent. As I said, it has now risen slightly to 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget was aimed at addressing that appalling savings performance. In fact, it was the very centrepiece of the government' strategy for re-election. Central to the plan is the reworking of the superannuation system from 1 January 1997, which is a long time away&mdash;again, over the hill far away. It reminds one of the legislation in this House on taxation reform which was going to be there, guaranteed; it was in law&mdash;l-a-w. We have exactly the same re-run on this. In that context a new three per cent employee superannuation payment was to be phased in through industrial awards. That was to be done because the government was not sure that it could control its vote in the Senate and was therefore not prepared to take the risk of what that may incur. So it has gone to the IRC and said, `Through your industrial award process we will now, over a series of years, reduce the take-home pay of every worker in Australia by three per cent.' This is in addition to the existing six per cent, bringing it up to nine per cent. The intention is that by the year 2002 the total contribution will be around 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental weakness of that approach is simply this: it will depend to a large degree on which union you belong to, under which award you happen to fall and if the union has the power and the capacity to influence the outcome as to whether you will get either that three per cent arrangement included in your final wage determination or whether you will end up being a loser. As I will demonstrate, the evidence is quite clear that there will probably be a lot of losers under this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, before the last election, the public was sold the legislated tax cuts, which were to commence on 1 January and were worth $1.8 billion for the first half of the year and over $4 billion for each full year after that, they thought they were going to get those as tax cuts from 1 January 1996. At best, they are now being told that they will be paid out, on a needs basis, on the basis of a subsidy of up to $1,000 per superannuation contributor as the government's share. In other words, it is a `feel good' promise. It is not a `be good' promise but a `feel good' promise&mdash;and there is a big difference between those two in politics. But we are told that politics is so much a case of impressions and not reality&mdash;and the Prime Minister has made an art form of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as I have said, this whole package is not before the parliament, apparently it is not intended to be before the parliament, with the possible exception of amendments to the taxation law. But certainly the proposal will not be before the House and it will go through the industrial relations system. The fundamental question that has to be asked is: will this proposal benefit everyone, as the Prime Minister claims? I now want to demonstrate to the House beyond any doubt that the answer is clearly no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the employer levy was implemented by legislation, the proposed employee levy will not be. If you are not therefore covered by an award, you simply miss out. There are hundreds and thousands of Australian workers, especially those on low income, who currently are not covered by awards in Australia. In reality therefore, the government's decision means that, once again, it will be employers who bear the cost of superannuation, largely. There is no doubt, given the experience of wage demands before the Industrial Relations Commission, that all new wage claims between now and the year 2000 will factor in the superannuation component, together with its inflationary impact. That will be particularly so for strong unions. It will be the strong unions who will have the major controlling impact on the demand for labour and on the price which labour will be able to seek in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the Prime Minister's claim that the proposal will see everybody retire and sail into the sunset with the minimum amount of $460,000. The fact of the matter is that Treasury estimates make it quite clear that the likelihood of that occurring is very slight indeed. Nevertheless, this is the way it has been approached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that the Prime Minister, in endeavouring to sell the benefits of his package, has used a four per cent real rate of return, which is totally spurious. It is true that the ASFA funds over the past 30 years have earned 4.4 per cent, if you take account of price increases only. But when salary increases are taken into account, the real rate of return has been almost half of that&mdash;some 2.8 per cent. What we are seeing here, yet again, is the grotesque raising of unreal expectations right across the country by a Prime Minister who wants to use superannuation and the savings of ordinary men and women in Australia as a political weapon for the next election campaign. It is a disgrace and he should be absolutely ashamed at doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that retirees between now and the year 2002 who would otherwise have had the benefit of income tax cuts starting on 1 January 1996, having been legislated in this House under that l-a-w principle that the Prime Minister told us about at the last election, will receive nothing except this very dubious superannuation promise, possibly some form of future subsidy from the government in 1998-99. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely gone, no doubt about that. For the self-funded retiree, there is nothing. Once again, the efforts of those who have, wisely and often with some difficulty, saved to provide for themselves have been totally ignored. The costs to the government's superannuation package under this new proposal, when existing tax benefits are included, will be at least $8 billion per year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Treasury's own document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Savings for our future</EMPHASIS>, the important thing is that the benefits are unquantifiable. In other words, unless you are presuming that bracket creep will be able to finance the government's proposals, there is nothing in the budget, including, as I said, the intention to legislate, which will provide any evidence as to where the additional $4.4 billion is supposed to come from. Again, it is pie in the sky. It is a promise in a rainbow. It is far from reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse than that is that the cost of the superannuation package, again according to the Treasury's own document, will grow faster than the cost of the tax cut it replaces and will eventually exceed the cost of those tax cuts. The consequent result of that is that there will be an unquantifiable impact on revenue loss, as earnings on increased superannuation savings are taxed at the concessional rate compared with those applying to alternative forms of saving. Furthermore, increased contributions by the self-employed would add to the cost of the package in net terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seems to have been ignored in all of this is the whole problem of churning. A real addition to saving can only be found if it is new savings&mdash;not the reworking of the existing savings dollar and not the removal of savings, say, from the banking system to put into superannuation. That is not real savings. That is simply a churning effect, which is often the outcome of policies which are badly designed, as this one clearly was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the budget's centrepiece? What was the reason behind this whole great strategy, apart from trying to win an election? It was rightly based on two words: national savings. The question therefore has to be: to what extent will this proposal translate into productive investment and economic growth? Projections from the Treasury's retirement income modelling task force, RIM, estimate that the proposals will contribute a mere one per cent increase in savings by 2005. By 2020, this figure is expected to rise to 1.7 per cent, a less than generous figure. It never goes beyond that. Given that the FitzGerald report recommended a rise in national savings of five per cent as being the target that Australian governments should aim for, one has to conclude that the efficacy of this Labor proposal as a savings measure is, quite simply, too little and too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the superannuation proposal is not really an effective savings measure, the question then has to be asked: who is going to benefit&mdash;apart from the government, of course? The obvious winners in this case are the ACTU and the affiliated unions thereof. They will be the ones who negotiate the package. They are the ones who negotiated this deal with the government in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their proposed award route, and the fact that only employee contributions paid into funds to which employer superannuation guarantee contributions are made will be recognised by the government for its contribution, blatantly ignores the rights of individual employees to freedom of choice, of either their fund or the style of investment they want, and directs a generous proportion of future superannuation contributions into industry funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean for the trade union movement, the membership of which is falling day by day? The answer is quite clear. Through this mechanism, the financial future of the trade union movement is absolutely guaranteed because through industry funds they will now have access not only to that three per cent. When that is spread over the majority of the work force, it runs to hundreds of millions of additional dollars of investment, which is giving the trade union movement into the future an enormous level of economic and social power in this country, regardless of the size of their membership. That is the most horrific and worrying aspect of this whole package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Willis), in an address to the Industry Funds Forum last week, justified the lack of provision for consumer choice as being compelled by `administrative simplicity'. I tell you what administrative simplicity is: it is all about monopoly. It is all about ensuring through the IRC that one or, at most, two superannuation funds are given effectively monopoly or duopoly control over all investment policy of all workers in a whole industry or group of industries. It also takes no account of the fact that you are going to see in the foreseeable future the aggregation of funds. Already there are probably too many. There will be fewer funds but they will be bigger funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those industry funds especially will, in due course, become in their own right new Australian investment institutions. They will not need the AMPs, the National Mutuals or any of the other major institutions which are currently operating in this area. These new institutions will stand alone, but they will have enormous economic power. Through shareholdings in the companies where their workers are employed, they will be in a position to call the shots on Australia's economic future well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues have not been raised by the Treasurer. These points certainly have not been raised by the Prime Minister. But these are the issues which the opposition is particularly concerned about. The aggregation of power in this country will ultimately be a danger to the Australian people, to their freedom and to the importance and relevance of this parliament. These issues must be looked at very carefully indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition supports the development by the industry of an effective transfer protocol between funds to help employees who are in more than one scheme and who often find themselves in a situation where the fund is actually going down year by year because no new contributions are being made but the costs, fees, charges and taxes are still being applied. The ultimate outcome is that the funds at retirement simply do not exist. That is why we have called upon the industry&mdash;as has the government, to its credit&mdash;to develop an effective transfer protocol between funds so that issues of vesting and portability can be addressed, to the interests of the contributors who are forced to save by the government through the compulsory system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has long supported greater freedom of choice for superannuation contributors. This is where our policy and that of the Labor government are absolutely at odds. The government wants a compulsory system. It wants a system where people are forced into it, with no freedom of choice, either in terms of choice of fund they want to belong to or choice of the investment strategy which they would like their funds to apply within the individual fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that monopoly situation, in that reactive environment which I referred to earlier, the industry has not had the opportunity to develop more flexibility so it can offer greater freedom of choice which we see as absolutely important. Surely, in the context of the Hilmer report, which we have heard so much about in this chamber and elsewhere, the same principles should apply to the superannuation industry as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is nothing wrong with freedom of choice. There is certainly nothing wrong with greater competition. It is in everybody's interests. Ultimately, that is the only way you can reduce costs, fees and charges; and, on the other side of the equation, maximise the opportunities for a more effective system where the funds have to relate to the demands and the needs of the community and their contributors, not be in the passive role where the contributors are simply putting funds in a compulsory scheme whether they like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the realities of all of this, according to Treasury, the amount which will be available to superannuation funds is expected to increase tenfold by 2020, from the current level of about $186 billion. In other words, quite early in the next century, we are talking about trillions of dollars of investment through superannuation funds. That is the most likely outcome that we are going to see in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the danger of this is that you are putting in the hands of a few fund managers economic power quite beyond the capacity possibly of this parliament or of most Australians to fully understand. It is a sad fact that, in that environment, there are risks which have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer now to the question of directed investment. Given the huge sums involved and the investment power the funds are obviously capable of creating, there will be a risk of political interference. The issue of directed investment may well raise its ugly head yet again, as it has from time to time in this place and elsewhere in recent years. The Treasurer recently gave this assurance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the government's policy not to interfere in investment decisions of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that, as funds grow, trustees will need to look beyond traditional investments if they are to sustain high rates of return. However, he added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be important not only to achieve the government's retirement incomes objectives but also to ensure that our superannuation savings are directed to maximising Australia's future economic development.</PARA>
<PARA>The danger is that a Labor government would intervene in order to ensure that this occurs, the direction he referred to will be part of the expected government policy. That is nothing unusual, because what the Treasurer said to the industry and what was said at the last Labor Party conference in Hobart are certainly not the same. In Hobart the party said&mdash;and this is its policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government will take all steps necessary, including an indication of preference in tender documents, to maximise the participation in bidding consortia by Australian superannuation funds, especially industry funds.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the attitude of mind is alive and well within the Labor Party and that attitude of mind is to direct investment of superannuation funds at some stage in the future. The implications of that are very important for every single contributor, because the government is simply saying, `You make your savings through a compulsory vehicle. We will then direct the investors as to how those moneys should be spent in what we see as the national interest.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear talk about money being directed towards infrastructure development, social objectives, the rebuilding of our cities and so forth. If that were ordinary taxation revenue taken from the Australian people as part of the outcome of a political campaign run through an election process, that may be sustainable, but this is not the same thing. These are the savings of millions of Australian workers. The reason that those savings have been taken is ostensibly to give them financial independence in their retirement. Yet there is this growing tendency in the government to say, `No, we will determine where those funds are going to be spent and, if the outcome is that there is a negligible return or no return, hard luck. Somehow or other costs will be shared with the next generation of superannuants coming through the system.' It is a very forced economic model and one which will bring considerable disillusionment to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said to LIFA last week, the industry must be forever on its guard against this sort of situation developing. However, `it is the industry's responsibility to prove to a public somewhat disillusioned by recent poor returns that it is able to manage the huge influx of funds in the community's interests. Power cannot be exercised without responsibility. Responsibility entails accountability'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the regulatory process for which the government must be responsible to ensure that accountability is clearly there. The first stage of the accountability process must be in the annual reporting arrangements in place through the CIS regulations, which bring together the contributors, the trustees and the fund managers in a symbiotic relationship which will ensure that those whose funds are being managed are aware at all times of the purposes for which that money is being used and the outcome of those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition superannuation policy has in recent months been questioned in this House by members opposite. I want to emphasise simply the points I made before. We have a policy which encourages people to be in superannuation. We have a policy which involves a mixture of compulsion on the one hand and voluntary support on the other. We have a policy which gives people much greater freedom to choose the funds in which they invest and in the management styles and the systems they want to apply. For example, people in their 20s may wish to have an investment profile which encourages greater risk but greater returns on their investment, whereas people in their 50s may prefer to have an investment profile with a heavy emphasis on capital accumulation and minimising of risks, because by that stage they are getting close enough to retirement not to want to lose their funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are two very different investment models. In most funds today those opportunities do not exist. You put your money into the fund&mdash;you are required to go into the fund&mdash;and it is invested for you under the terms and conditions determined by the trustees, not by you as a contributor. Those changes we regard as absolutely fundamental if we want to have a society which is confident of the objectives of government policy, which is to maximise national savings while at the same time being confident that their investments are secure in their own interests and the interests of their family to guarantee them a retirement which they can look forward to, and at the same time which makes a contribution to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) is the second opportunity we have had to debate superannuation issues in the past two sitting weeks. That is in addition to the opportunities we have had to talk about superannuation in the appropriation debates. In these circumstances, it is possible to explain the fact that the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) could not find the time to come into the parliament to conduct this legislation. I have great regard for the abilities of my friend the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), but I suggest he does not pretend to have established any credentials in the area of superannuation. I again make the point that once again the arrogance of this government knows no bounds. The arrogance it displays towards this parliament is despicable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could add that to the fact that with the previous piece of legislation in the previous sitting week and today not one speaker from the Labor Party was or is listed. No doubt the whip could, if he really wanted to, hurry around now and dredge up someone to come in to make a few innocuous remarks. During appropriation debates a whole raft of speakers opposite get up and talk about superannuation, which they claim is the centrepiece of this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a chance to talk about the nitty-gritty of the legislation and how we will get to what those opposite say their Prime Minister-cum-emperor says will be achieved by the superannuation policies of his government. This is the opportunity to see the legislation and how it will work, but where are the supporters of the government? They are missing, absent&mdash;not without leave but with leave, I suggest. So we have this stupid situation where people get up over there and rabbit on about the policy on superannuation promoted by this government and what it will achieve, but not one of them can come in here or will take the time to understand the legislation which makes those stated policy objectives possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill relates to one of the Commonwealth Public Service employee superannuation schemes, whereas the other piece of legislation I referred to a little while ago had to do with problems with small accounts. This bill was introduced into the House on 29 March. Members opposite have had plenty of time to prepare their remarks and try to understand it if they were genuinely interested in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's primary goal is to complete the process of bringing the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, the CSS, and the public sector superannuation scheme, the PSS, under the guidelines of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, which will be referred to as `the act' in later remarks. It is a goal with which the coalition has no argument. It follows that we will not be opposing the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there is also a significant amount of discussion about superannuation, and I have referred to it in this parliament. Seemingly every speaker on the government side wants to mention it but none of them wants to understand how it is working and, more importantly, how it is not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures contained in the budget, and a renewed interest in the limited choice of superannuation schemes as well as portability, are among the reasons for my interest today and that of many in the industry and many potential superannuants. Whatever the reason, it goes without saying that superannuation is an issue of national importance and should be treated as such. This applies to public sector superannuation schemes, of which the CSS and PSS are examples, and the various private sector industry award schemes and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Public sector schemes at both state and federal levels are traditionally very generous to their members. It is no doubt appreciated by those of us who have benefited over the years, but the fact remains that they are largely funded by taxpayers and they are largely built upon unfunded liabilities of many millions of dollars. The exception to this is Queensland where successive governments have maintained a fully funded scheme. I intend to touch on these matters in more depth later if I have time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is an important issue simply because Australia has a population which we describe as ageing. In 1992, 13.4 per cent of the Australian population were of age pension vintage. I am informed that the Department of Social Security predicts that this will increase to around 14.4 per cent by the year 2001 and finally reaching a peak of 25.7 per cent in the year 2031. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As government funds are limited&mdash;and I presume they always will be&mdash;the importance of individuals making provision for their retirement has never been greater. The number of self-funded retirees in our community is increasing greatly. The proportion of the population who are of pensionable age and who are receiving the pension or equivalent has declined from something like 86.3 per cent in 1980 to an estimated 77.5 per cent in 1992. It has been estimated that by the year 2031 the proportion receiving the pension may reduce to around 20 per cent of the population eligible, by reason of age, for a pension. Let us hope that by 2031 we will still be able to afford a pension system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it follows that the need for government to foster a fair, just and equitable system for self-funded retirees cannot be overstated. One of the most important starting points for many people in planning for their retirement is to be assured of a stable and predictable political policy and economic environment. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know only too well, this has not been the case over recent years; it has not been there over recent years. Year after year Labor has failed to develop a retirement income strategy, yet the government has been quick to grab the extra revenue it receives because of the superannuation contributions tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I am sure you have not forgotten&mdash;that in 1988-89 the government collected $7 million in superannuation tax. In 1994-95 the government will collect $1.9 billion and the estimate for 1995-96 is $2.15 billion. That is not a bad sort of a milch cow. It is no wonder people looking at their individual superannuation account statements see that they are going backwards, because the funds have not been earning well in recent times. Taken off the top of their five per cent contribution is the government's 15 per cent tax. So they are really not paying five per cent into their superannuation account; they are paying 4.25 per cent. That is why it is going backwards. People think five per cent is good, but when they do the compound multiplication they find it is not adding up because there is 15 per cent taken off the top. That is not a bad return for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the estimated superannuation tax from 1988-89, when it was $7 million, to 1995-96 is a factor of over 30,000 per cent&mdash;not a bad little earner. We will have to ride that pig's back right into the next century if we should be unlucky enough for Labor to stay in government. Heaven help the taxpayers of Australia and the potential superannuants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building blocks of a genuine retirement income strategy are there, and they are not in dispute. I made mention of these points in the debate on the previous legislation, but they deserve to be listed again. A genuine retirement income strategy requires a stable and predictable political environment; security; incentives to encourage financial independence; better integration of the tax and social security systems; and the guarantee of a government safety net. Few would disagree with those fundamentals, I suggest. However, the fact is that for many people retirement policy these days is beyond comprehension. The changes to the legislation have been massive and seemingly unending. We have already had two bills this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in complexity of superannuation law is nearly as great as the growth in complexity of taxation law, and that is saying something. The FitzGerald report on national savings summed up the mess which the government has created with superannuation when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It goes almost without saying that further change to superannuation is not desirable in itself&mdash;continual change in recent years has engendered complexity and uncertainty and diminished confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>That was at the time of the FitzGerald report, which was more than a year ago, and it has not got any better since then. The challenge that remains is to keep it simple. The government obviously cannot come to terms with that. It cannot decide what its strategy should be to meet its total objectives. The government has eroded the community's confidence in superannuation in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the results of Labor's persistent meddling and tinkering has been the growing perception that superannuation no longer represents an attractive savings and investment vehicle. Public confidence in superannuation needs to be restored. This will be a primary objective of the coalition's approach to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to discuss in any depth here the superannuation developments contained in the budget. However, I want to make the point that whilst national savings will increase as a result of the introduction of employee contributions&mdash;provided other savings habits remain static&mdash;there is still no real choice available to Australian workers in deciding which superannuation scheme to join; that is, in deciding whom to trust with their retirement money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in post-budget interviews described the great returns Australians will receive from their superannuation when they retire&mdash;that is if they live to the year 2042 and start contributing now. He obviously does not realise that many workers are in superannuation schemes which perform dismally. In other words, they do not earn sufficient to provide the sort of end result that the Prime Minister so glibly predicts for 2042 or whenever it was. This is made worse because most workers have no choice as to which superannuation scheme their money can rest and prosper in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to amend four acts dealing with the CSS and the PSS, as I said. The amendments will ensure that Commonwealth superannuation arrangements comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act and regulations under that act. It will also correct anomalies, restore the original intentions of certain provisions, remove gender specific terms, and make technical and drafting changes to improve the administrative efficiency of the schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SI(S) requires that trustees of public sector superannuation schemes should elect that the schemes become regulated under SI(S) by 1 July 1995. The amendments to the acts are to take effect from that date. The bill also includes formal amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948. Some of the provisions in these amendments continue to apply to persons who resigned or retired prior to 1976, which is interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1994 amended the 1976 act and other acts to commence the process of compliance with SI(S). The bill proposes to amend the act to correct a drafting error. It will also amend the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 to remove gender specific terms, which I have mentioned before. These generally go along the same line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the complexity and volume of superannuation legislation, there is a need for a technical correction bill such as this, and I have touched on the complexity of its incessant changes. If this bill is a precedent for like legislation, it should be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is the perfect opportunity for me to reiterate some concerns that I have made known previously. As honourable members would be aware, there are no employer contributions from the Commonwealth to meet future claims upon the CSS and only very limited contributions to the PSS. On retirement, the employer component of the CSS, and most of the PSS, comes from consolidated revenue. This means that for the CSS alone there was an unfunded liability of $33 billion as at 30 June 1992. This was a liability of $1,903 for each man, woman and child in this country. For the PSS, the employer contribution is only three per cent of salary. This leaves the remaining 12.4 per cent unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government's potential liability does not end there. In the CSS, employee contributions are invested by Commonwealth Funds Management&mdash;the CFM&mdash;with returns to employees based on investment incomes. In the PSS though, employee contributions are invested by the CFM, but the return is guaranteed and not limited to investment returns. The Commonwealth thereby has to make up any shortfall that occurs, further exposing consolidated revenue to the need to pay out PSS members on retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fully funded superannuation scheme is the most desirable scheme to have in place. The strongest argument in support of full funding concerns the principle of intergenerational equity. It is more equitable that the cost of liabilities currently incurred should be met by the present generation and should not be left to be paid for by future generations. Future generations may simply not have the capacity to pay for the superannuation of preceding generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lessening of future fiscal flexibility will severely inhibit the ability of future generations to make the necessary decisions on where taxpayers' funds can best be allocated. It is quite clear that the postwar generation&mdash;commonly referred to as the baby boomers&mdash;has created a debt burden that will blight our children's lives. This blight will occur because the children of the baby boom generation will be left to pay the unfunded superannuation and pensions of their parents, as well as the mounting health and nursing home bills. This is a key reason why future public and private sector superannuation should be fully funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is also an important component of Labor costs, and governments should be recognising these costs and paying for them as they arise. There could also be the added bonus of giving governments increased resolve to keep staff numbers under control and inhibit governments from engaging in activities for which there is no real benefit from the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fully funded schemes would also have the advantage that governments would need to keep schemes within the demands of economic realities. One of the few arguments against the full funding of public sector superannuation is that, while Australia is a net borrower, it does not make sense to borrow further in order to fund public sector superannuation. This is a valid point, and I suspect there are others. The reasons for establishing fully funded schemes are much more persuasive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, when establishing the PSS in 1990, took the decision to partially fund the scheme to avoid a large increase in unfunded liabilities. When establishing the PSS, the government not only made it partially funded but also reduced the level of future entitlements due to fund members. This has been achieved by reducing the new entrant contribution rate&mdash;that is, the average employer contribution expressed as a percentage of salary&mdash;from 22.8 per cent to 15.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is not the only Australian government to reduce the level of its own contributions. New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have all created new public sector superannuation schemes which are partially funded and have reduced employer contributions. As of 30 June 1992 Victoria's unfunded superannuation liabilities amounted to $18 billion, which at $4,063 per capita is the worst in the nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have probably worked harder and longer for the coalition in relation to superannuation policy than any other member. The member for Bradfield, the member for Curtin and the government agree that superannuation policy is one of the most important matters of public policy in this country. It is of enormous significance to men and women, not just those reaching retirement age but all Australians who must one day cross that threshold to retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the history books record the milestones in superannuation policy of the Commonwealth of Australia, they will see that the time of the Keating government has been an unprecedented time of enormous change. The policy settings have been put in place to take this country through into the next century. The government has not only made sweeping reforms to extend accessibility to superannuation but also put in place a supervisory and prudential regime which we believe safeguards the benefits and rights of superannuation schemes. </PARA>

The tragedy is that both the member for Bradfield and the member for Curtin will be experiencing a superannuation policy of a different kind having been quite unfairly and, I think many of us on this side of the House believe, unjustly removed in preselection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak today on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I intend to focus my remarks on the economy of local areas, local governments, the budget's implications in those areas and some of the issues which I believe are still causing some problems in the economy in relation to regional Australia. Under the budgetary proposals, money was appropriated for housing and regional development, urban management, local government and industry, and I wish to cover some of those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In urban management, the government has instituted a continuing and active role for the Commonwealth in Australia's cities through $247 million in additional funding for the continuation of the better cities program. That $247 million includes: $36 million over six years for continued better cities planning and detailed studies in priority areas where major capital investment is expected; $200 million over four years for capital investment in developing and renewing key areas of Australia's major cities to advance national economic, social and environmental performance&mdash;of this amount, $100 million will be allocated over the next three years through Better Cities for investment in key rail-based urban corridors in Queensland, and I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford), who is at the table, would take interest in that one&mdash;and $11 million over six years for running costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, there is an allocation of $2.4 million over four years to pilot and evaluate service improvements to important parts of the public transport system in the cities and $3 million over six years for urban design initiatives, including the Australia Prize for Urban Design awarded by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are incentives for local government to assist national economic, environmental and social objectives through the introduction of an expanded local government development program with additional funding of $48 million over four years. There will be an extension of the housing industry and urban exports strategy at a total cost of $12.8 million over five years, and $8.5 million will be spent over four years to improve the protection and management of Australia's coastline. These are all very important issues and need to be further developed over those periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regional development, an additional $5 million will be spent over three years to expand the department's regional office network to support regional development organisations across Australia. There will be rationalisation of the functions and activities of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, which is to be wound up, and $15.6 million will be spent over three years through the Office of Northern Development to fund strategic roads in the Northern Territory, improving access to indigenous communities. These are all very important matters in relation to regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to housing, there will be an increase in rent assistance of $5 a fortnight to families with children at a cost of $88 million over four years. Over five years, $12.7 million will be spent to increase the capacity of local government and the community housing sector to provide housing for Australians on low incomes and to support the development of the new Commonwealth-state housing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be savings from the social housing subsidy program of $10 million in 1995-96 and $16 million in each of the subsequent three years. There will be further integration of job placement, employment and training pilot programs within Working Nation and half a million dollars will be appropriated for Australia's participation in the 1996 United Nations habitat conference. Of course money will also be appropriated to the Department of Social Security for housing. It is these areas of housing and regional development to which I wish to address most of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are finding with the structural change in Australia, particularly in Victoria and in the area that I represent, the electorate of McMillan, is that there has been massive structural change all occurring in a short period of time over about three years. Some of that structural change has flowed from changes in our electricity industry in Victoria. Our region is a pretty unique region of Australia. All the power stations of Victoria are coal-fired stations, except for one gas-fired station located in the municipality of La Trobe in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of change has been particularly difficult for the people in that community. It is a very small community of 100,000 people, but they have had to carry the load of the structural change. To put it on the record in the federal parliament again, the electricity industry has gone from a work force of 10,300 when it was owned by the government to a corporatised privatised operation now of 2,800 employees at the moment. With the latest packages being signed up at present, it looks like dropping to about 1,800 employees&mdash;from 10,300 to 1,800. That would have an enormous impact on any area, and it is having a devastating impact on our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community is handling it in a vigorous way. It is not laying down and saying all is lost. There are many things we can do and the community is responding very well. Some of those employees have been re-employed by private companies which are doing the outsourcing work for the power station companies. About 2,000 of the 7,000-odd who have left the SEC have found employment with them. However, employment for the others is rather difficult. To overcome problems of this nature, and I think the Gregory report that was released recently pointed this out from the census figures, some of this impact on particular areas needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria at the moment the other restructure that has taken place has been in local government. It is probably the area, along with private industry, that will feel the full impact of implementing the structural change. But we have a particularly difficult problem in Victoria with the restructure of local government in that the Kennett government has set about the restructure in a very dramatic way. It has appointed commissioners to control the operation and has also passed legislation demanding that the commissioners act in a particular way and further cut expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cutting expenditure is adding to our problem, along with the loss of jobs in the State Electricity Commission and what has happened there. In fact our local government has been asked to cut $6.2 million from a $23 million budget over a period of three years, which also means the loss of jobs. One hundred people have now lost their jobs in the local government area. With the outsourcing and contracting out, which has been made compulsory by legislation, many more jobs will go as the contracting out occurs and people will have to find jobs with the new contractors, if they are able. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our major problem then stems from the question: where does local government get the money required to respond to some of the Commonwealth programs? One of the major initiatives of this government has been the Working Nation program. It has been very effective around Australia in assisting people to get back into the work force and giving them the training and the opportunities that are required in order to convince private employers that they do have a role to play in the economy. Our great difficulty occurs in that many of these programs rely upon some capital grant works in order to make them operational. Otherwise, if you try to employ 15 people in a supervised group with no capital you are virtually, in many cases, cleaning up weeds and planting trees. That has a very worth while end in its own right, however, there are many other objectives that I am sure the local communities would like to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem in our area. We have had a depressed area now for a considerable time. We have had a problem with the rate base for local governments. We have very run-down infrastructure, particularly in Morwell and Moe, where local government would participate in normal circumstances to assist the community. Because there has been no capital base, the unemployed of that region are expected to go and work in other regions of Gippsland, where the money is available, to provide capital for the works program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate we have to the west the new municipality of Baw Baw. They have been very successful. It is a credit to their organisation that they have been able to put programs forward. I had the privilege nine weeks ago of launching a major program there with 103 former unemployed people. Well over $1 million in labour support was being provided, plus something like $700,000 for training support and management of the program. The municipality was able to put in a fair share of funds in order to have the works put in place. I am going along next Friday to inspect the process at half stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been other programs. The Walhalla railway in the Baw Baw shire has received two programs. A third program is about to start. There have been 30 employees for half a year, 26 weeks, on works on the Walhalla rail line. The community is working towards redeveloping a rail line for tourist purposes. When you consider that some 30 people have been paid for half a year by the Commonwealth with another 10 coming on stream, a considerable amount of money has been injected into the Baw Baw shire, as well as $400,000 for supervision, support and training. The local community has also been able to raise some funds. So several millions of dollars have gone into different parts of Gippsland in these training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have great difficulty in the municipality of La Trobe getting programs off the ground. The total sum of money for 12 programs was $25,000 from local government. When the program organisers or the brokers approached the local government they were informed that only a couple of thousand dollars would be available and that therefore there would be great difficulty getting 15 people for 26 weeks. This was of great concern. We did not seem to be able to get anywhere. We were able to convince the municipality recently that the former Moe City, the people in charge before the amalgamation, had put aside $150,000 for new work programs and, therefore, that new work money should be available. However, the commissioners decided that $25,000 was all they were able to make available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioners were obviously under pressure from the Kennett government to reduce costs and to make savings. They had set aside $80,000&mdash;there would be no action at the moment; perhaps they would have a look at it in the future. When we found out that that $80,000 was there, after a few meetings of the local football club and other organisations in the area we soon had a delegation to the commissioners and we were able to raise $30,000 locally to support a program. The commissioners responded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem in the area is the lack of a rate base. The power stations in the Latrobe Valley do not pay rates. They have not paid rates because they have been owned by the government. There has been the charity bit of $10,000, a bit here, a bit somewhere else. However, with the move of Mission Energy, a private company, to Loy Yang B as 51 per cent owners, they found they were paying by law $708,000 a year in rates. That $708,000 a year has been very beneficial over the last couple of years to Traralgon city and Traralgon shire. But now there are the new amalgamations and the sale of the power stations. I have always believed that once state instrumentalities are corporatised and privatised they should pay rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the Premier putting a case to him about this. I raised the issues with him on 30 March, with a copy to Alan Stockdale, the state Treasurer. I put to him that the most obvious means by which his government could meet its responsibilities would be to begin paying rates on the local companies it has now formed with legislation and that the people in the Latrobe Valley should not have to wait for the full process of privatisation before the region sees its fair share of rate moneys returning to its coffers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kennett replied to me on 12 April, and I will read that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Cunningham</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter regarding corporatised companies paying rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are reforming the Latrobe Valley to ensure its future, that of its employees, and to bring the electricity industry into the 21st Century.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jeff Kennett</PARA>
<PARA>I wrote back to him on 1 May, saying:</PARA>

<PARA>He wrote back to me on 15 May, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Cunningham</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 1 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are getting a bit sensitive in your old age. I did not attack you personally, and I thought my answer was quite clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporatised bodies will not pay municipal rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jeff Kennett</PARA>
<PARA>That sat on my desk for a week, during which time I pondered that approach by our esteemed premier. Then on 22 May I received this letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Cunningham</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RATING PROVISIONS FOR GENERATION COMPANIES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My letter of 15 May 1995 on this topic has been superseded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following further debate of this issue, by both the Cabinet, Party, and Ministers concerned, the revised position, to be incorporated by way of a House Amendment to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">the Electricity Industry Amendment Bill</EMPHASIS> is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.the existing municipal rating exemption for Victoria Power Exchange, Power Net Victoria and the SEC remains;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.all land held by distribution companies and generation companies (in this context, including General Victoria) is to be rateable under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Local Government Act</EMPHASIS>;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.in relation to generation companies (and only with respect to land associated with power stations), if the parties do not agree the amount of rates, then an arbitration process through the Victoria Grants Commission will be triggered. One of the factors which the Commission must take into account in determining reasonable rates is to be the amount payable in accordance with section 27 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Loy Yang B Act 1992</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jeff Kennett</PARA>
<PARA>That letter certainly created a lot of interest in the local area. Reading it one way, all land will be rateable. However, I am now informed&mdash;and I have not yet written back to the premier&mdash;from discussions at the local level, when the local government sought clarification, that they do not really mean to pay the rates just yet and that perhaps, if they go and negotiate, they might get some money out of the state government. However, they do not really mean that rates should be paid until it is fully privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a confused situation where at the moment I am seeking clarification from the premier, as are the people in the local government. However, I am worried at the silence from the local members of the state parliament in the region, both National and Liberal, who do not appear to want to offend Jeffrey in any way at all. We know that our commissioners at the local government level are appointed by the Premier and are working to legislation and that he is laying down the law. Therefore, they are never going to represent the local people on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, today I am calling upon those local state members to stand up for the local people and to start putting a case to this premier. This is a serious matter, not to be trivialised. Obviously, the Premier's letter of the 15th having been superseded, we know now that the Local Government Act is to be instigated, with all land held by distribution companies and generation companies to be rateable under the Local Government Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the opinion&mdash;and I have advised the shire, the chief commissioner, that, if I were him, I would be seeking legal advice on the legislation that has gone through the state parliament, because my belief is that what Jeffrey Kennett is doing at the present time is trying to find new owners for what are clearly private companies. He has structured his legislation, they have boards of directors, they have revamped all the employee structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the state government is doing now is trying to sell those organisations to private companies by trade sale. Trade sale does not mean that he has to put through new legislation again. So I am firmly of the view that it is worth while seeking legal advice and putting the pressure right back on to the Kennett government and saying to it, `When are you going to honour this commitment?' It means about $3 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking a line through the fact that one half owner of one power station pays $708,000 in rates, then I would expect that the other half owner, which is the privatised section of Loy Yang B, would do the same. Loy Yang A is exactly the same size power station and can contribute a similar amount of money. We are talking about $3 1/2 million of rate money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that honest position were taken, the government's programs at the federal level under Working Nation would be of great benefit to the Latrobe valley region. The municipality does not have the capital funds to match the program. We are calling on the state government at this stage to move this along and to order the managers of their private companies to do their business plans again and put on the deck the fact that they do have a responsibility to the local community by way of rates. They have destroyed the economy by taking the employment out of it. Surely we are entitled to our money back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this plea today in the debate on the appropriation bills: the Commonwealth has appropriated moneys which are available for programs and, if there is a need for matching money in these programs of urban development in particular and housing, this is the opportunity for local government to participate. But it is being stifled by the fact that the industries in that municipality, owned by the government privately at present in a private structure, are not paying their way by way of rates. </PARA>

For the benefit of those who define economic recovery as that point in the economic cycle when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) acquires a $2 million home, I would like to quote from a letter I received recently:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am worrying about happiness for our children, their future and also ours. I am worrying about not getting enough money to live a decent life, about not being able to afford much, about working too hard for too little money, about having no job security. The price of property has not risen much for a very long time. I am worried about not having enough money for retirement or for my family. I am 49 years old, my husband is 60 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the message echoed in letter after letter I am receiving. Another states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My wage packet is going only to the essentials these days and I have not had a pay rise in two years (I gross no more than $27,500). It is hard when everything is going up. . . I only need one more rise in my health care insurance and I am opting out. I can't cope with any more price hikes.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet another letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel most insecure at all times.</PARA>
<PARA>These letters do not represent isolated cases of hardship. They are typical! In a recent survey of more than 600 households in my electorate, I put the question: do you consider yourself to be more financially secure than you were three years ago? Seventy-one per cent said no, they were worse off. These people are the ones the Prime Minister has forgotten in his misguided euphoria, in his conviction that `this is as good as it gets'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial hardship in a climate of economic growth is the very essence of the recoveries the Prime Minister oversees. They are recoveries in which some find themselves in a position to buy that house on the harbour they have always wanted, while others are struggling to pay their next bill. They are shallow, fleeting recoveries as fewer and fewer Australians get back on their feet before the bust. They are recoveries in which the economic sun shines briefly&mdash;and each time it does, it does so for an increasingly select few. Put together, they are dividing Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a decade of Labor rule, the share of total income earned by the richest 10 per cent of Australians rose from 21.9 per cent to just under 25 per cent in 1993. Total income for the poorest 10 per cent of earners fell to 2.8 per cent. This division is also manifesting itself between the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National economic growth for the year to September 1994 was 6.3 per cent; South Australia's growth was 1.7 per cent. Unemployment nationally is 8.7 per cent; South Australia's rate is 10.3 per cent. Given time, South Australia could have generated the growth rates and the employment that we need to tackle the massive public debt left to us by the Bannon Labor government, but we were not given time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1992, the Prime Minister announced in the One Nation statement that he would cut taxes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am promising is not to put up tax!</PARA>
<PARA>Since the last election, the following tax increases have been implemented or announced: fringe benefits tax increased by 130.7 per cent; wine tax increased from 22 to 24 per cent; excise on unleaded petrol increased by 5c per litre; excise on leaded petrol increased by 7c per litre; tobacco excise increased twice; sales tax increased across the board twice; sales tax on new vehicles increased by five per cent; sales tax on certain building materials increased by 12 per cent; company sales tax increased to 36 per cent; and the Medicare levy increased to 1.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the third year of a parliamentary term in which no new taxes were promised, the tax take will increase in the 1995-96 budget by $2,400 million. This is the second largest tax increase since the irresponsible Whitlam years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is the promise of a $718 million surplus worth? It is worth as much as all the other promises&mdash;nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget betrays the battlers like the people whose letters I have read; people who looked to the government to do what was necessary to ensure that the recovery would be sustained and to ensure that the economic sunshine would last a little longer than five minutes. To ensure this, the government needed to attack its budget deficit. This it did not have the political courage or integrity to genuinely do. At the beginning of his budget speech, the Treasurer claimed to have produced, in his words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a massive turnaround in the budget outcome of $12.9 billion . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, on page 2 of the budget speech, the Treasurer admits:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures announced tonight provide a net fiscal tightening . . . of $3 billion in 1995-96 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As this statement makes clear, the massive turnaround in the budget outcome was not achieved by spending restraint. It should be noted that, in real terms, government spending in 1995-96 will grow by 1.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the net fiscal tightening of $3 billion, the remainder of the $12.9 billion turnaround the government has achieved is made up of the increased revenue that comes from economic growth, of $5.3 billion worth of asset sales and of creative accounting. Among the more creative of the government's accounting practices, one would have to list the following: $994 million in debt repayment from Queensland; $107 million in higher dividends from government business enterprises; $250 million from a reconfiguration of Telstra equity injections; and $75 million from a capital repayment by Australia Post. These are one-off payments which only the most creative of accountants would use in calculating the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real bottom line for the 1995-96 budget&mdash;the one that deals with recurrent government spending and government revenue&mdash;is in fact tucked away at the back of the budget papers. Excluding such things as asset sales and other one-off payments, the real deficit, as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is $8.2 billion. Fudge-it budgets have no place in Australian government. The very essence of a democratic system of government is accountability, and disinformation makes it impossible to hold governments accountable. Honesty must be reintroduced into Australian government and one of the first tasks of a coalition government will be to hold a commission of audit to find the true state of the Commonwealth books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than help South Australia get on its feet, this budget will hit us hard. In the budget the government increased the sales tax on sinks, taps, putty, paint, nails, kitchen cupboards and many other building materials by 12 per cent. In this way, the government plans to raise $523 million in 1995-96. Many of my constituents on low and middle incomes have bought older, cheaper houses with the intention of renovating. The government's new 12 per cent tax on materials used in building will stop many of the renovations planned in my electorate. With the building industry already slowing, jobs will be lost as a result of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five per cent tax hike on new cars will have much the same impact and will be disastrous in view of South Australia's dependence on the car industry. The day after the budget, the wholesale sales tax on new cars rose from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. On 1 July, when the second of the across-the-board sales tax increases which were legislated for in the 1993 budget takes place, the sales tax on new cars will rise to 22 per cent. The result: the cost of the average family car will increase by $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must question why the Prime Minister has changed his mind and also, once again, his word. In his One Nation speech in February 1992 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the sales tax that was permanently lowered to 15 per cent has been raised to 16 per cent since the last election, has been raised another five per cent in the 1995-96 budget and will be increased by another one per cent on 1 July. This is permanency under a Keating government! I suggest that this tax hike on new cars&mdash;that is, cars that run on unleaded fuel&mdash;is indicative of the Prime Minister's real commitment to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who contracted to buy a new car before the release of the budget on 9 May, the $1,000 that they now are asked to pay on that originally contracted price is causing enormous hardship. I have been contacted by people caught in this situation and, having already stretched themselves to buy their car at its original price, they simply do not have another $1,000 to meet this new obligation. Yet, having signed a contract, they are required to proceed with the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reasonable government would have exempted those who have already signed contracts from this tax. It is a measure of this government's arrogance that it did not do so. I know many people in my electorate are already struggling to make ends meet. Another $1,000 for a new car will price them out of this market. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most immediate effect of this decision will be to cut sales by up to 20,000 vehicles in what was already shaping up to be a difficult year for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>This jeopardises the jobs of 37,000 South Australians employed in the car industry. Again, the three per cent tax hike for companies will jeopardise jobs at a time when sections of my electorate have rates of unemployment well above 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indicative of the government's lack of economic direction that before the last election it lowered corporate tax to 33 per cent with much fanfare. The government waxed lyrical about narrowing the gap between Australia's corporate tax rates and that of our Asian neighbours so that overseas investors would be attracted to Australia. By raising corporate tax again, the government has jeopardised this important source of investment and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the small businesses concentrated in inner Adelaide the loss of cashflow because of the increase in company tax will be a barrier to expansion, putting a lid on job growth when South Australia is still suffering 10.3 per cent unemployment. In an electorate where so much employment depends on small business my fear is that this sector, in the wake of the hike in company tax, will take the Prime Minister's advice that `If they're feeling the pinch, they ought to say, "Small business is not for me."'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the struggle to make ends meet that so many of my constituents are telling me about, it is absolutely unacceptable that the second round of One Nation tax cuts has disappeared off the political agenda. As I said during the debate on last year's budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By not handing over the&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>second round of One Nation tax cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that it promised the Australian people, the government is effectively pocketing the benefits of the recovery, benefits which rightfully belong to those who bore the brunt of the recession: the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>It is middle Australia, too, that loses out in this budget. The tax cuts abandoned by the Prime Minister could have provided significant relief to the middle income range&mdash;those earning between $30,000 and $50,000. As a leading Flinders University senior lecturer in economics, Mr Graham Scott, has said, Australia's unenviable reputation as a high income tax country has been reinforced by this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's latest promise is that the money people would have received from the One Nation tax cuts will be now paid into their superannuation fund. But those who retire between now and the year 2002 will not receive the full benefit of the tax cuts they have been obliged to forgo. And what of our self-funded retirees&mdash;those who were frugal and saved for their retirement? Those retirees pay tax and once again they will suffer from the Prime Minister's broken promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too many people in my electorate are battling. This budget plays with their future as though they no longer matter. The current account for April was $2.252 billion in the red. This is the eighth current account deficit of more than $2 billion in the last nine months. The Keating government is allowing Australia to run a current account deficit of around six per cent of GDP, allowing Australia to run a current account deficit which runs second only to Mexico as being the highest in the OECD&mdash;a current account deficit which puts us in the danger zone where in the past the confidence in the Australian dollar has collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember the trigger for the banana republic recession and that recession we `had to have'? It was a current account deficit running at six per cent of GDP. Australians are living in this danger zone, and their future is being gambled on whether the government can achieve the asset sales it has relied on to balance this year's books. The government has brought its budget into surplus by relying on $5.35 billion worth of asset sales. So it is perhaps pertinent to ask: what is the government's record on asset sales?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1990-91 the government has forecast asset sales of $8 billion. It has managed to sell only $3.8 billion worth of assets&mdash;less than half of that it had planned. Even if the government does manage to sell $5.35 billion worth of assets in one year, no progress will have been made towards increasing the pool of national savings, which was the whole point of bringing the budget into surplus. With asset sales, money will simply flow from private savings to public savings. It is ironic that the Treasurer, at the beginning of his budget speech, assured us the budget would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy . . . it will do so by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long-term decline of our national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Prime Minister travelled Australia hawking his 13th budget, he assured us, `It's never going to get any better. I mean, this is as good as it gets.' If this is as good as it gets, I urge the Prime Minister to take the same path he has told small businesses to take and say, `Politics is not for me.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That remains to be seen. Whether it is the last occasion on which I speak or not, I certainly will not be saying anything that will give any comfort to the opposition. We have to sit here and listen to opposition members rave on, as they always do, particularly about taxation. We had the outrageous figure of $2.4 billion quoted by the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) as the increase in tax receipts. I guess the honourable member for Adelaide should think about the answer she got to her question yesterday to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there were some minor tax rises in the budget, the reality is that most of that increase in taxation receipts for the next financial year will come from the fact that in the last two years there have been 560,000-plus new jobs created, which means that there are nearly half a million more people working in Australia than there were two years ago. If they are working that means they pay tax. I know a lot of people whose ambition it was to be able to pay tax, which meant that they wanted a job. A lot of those people now have jobs because of the policies of this government. Naturally, that means that tax receipts increase and as such revenue increases. We should all be very pleased about that. Indeed, the government is very pleased about that. So it is hardly justifiable to attack the government on increased tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this budget has a number of positive aspects. Like all budgets, it has been widely reported, and, I guess, criticised in some areas. One of the major positive initiatives in this budget is that of superannuation. The superannuation initiatives outlined will boost national savings, as recommended by the FitzGerald report a couple of years ago. That is very important for our economy and Australia's future.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to superannuation will be opened up for many more people. By the year 2002, most Australian workers will have access to 15 per cent superannuation&mdash;that is, a three per cent employee contribution, a three per cent government contribution and a nine per cent employer contribution. That is a major breakthrough, as superannuation is important because it provides workers with security in retirement&mdash;the sort of access that many of them did not have until this government was elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this government was elected in 1983 only 40 per cent of Australian workers had access to superannuation; it is now 90 per cent. So the number of people who have access to a superannuation scheme has increased from 40 per cent to 90 per cent in 12 years because of the policies of this Labor government. There has also been an enormous increase in the number of women who now have access to superannuation. In 1983, 24 per cent of women had access and now 85 per cent have access. The number of working women who now have access to superannuation is more than three times what it was in 1983. Only Labor could have done that. We have been able to do that because of our commitment to social justice, our commitment to working people and our commitment to economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, it is desirable to increase national savings and to provide for people through superannuation schemes so that those people are not reliant on the age pension system. With an ageing population, it is very important for working people to have access to superannuation funds, through the schemes to be introduced by this government, when they retire, so that they are not an unnecessary drain on the social security system. A very important range of initiatives has been announced by this government not only in this budget but also over the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $816 a year means tested maternity allowance, which is long overdue, has also been introduced, thanks to the negotiating efforts of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national childhood immunisation program is also very important. Some $11 million has been allocated to this program in the next financial year. This major program addresses health issues and provides social justice for families. We hear a lot from the opposition about families, but it is the government that actually has policies for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about the major initiative announced in the budget in relation to mental health. Over the last year I have chaired a caucus subcommittee on mental health. The federal government is taking a much more pro-active role in looking at mental health, which is an area of social policy that has traditionally been a state government responsibility. Mental health is a bit like Aboriginal health really. It has been a state government responsibility in the past, which is probably the reason why it has been a major area of neglect in respect of social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the federal government, through the national mental health strategy, is taking a more pro-active role. In last year's budget the government provided about $260-odd million over the next four years. Some of that money has been allocated to state governments while some has been allocated to national programs in order to improve our mental health services. In this year's budget, funding of $13 million has been allocated over the next four years for youth suicide programs. That comprises $7 million in additional funding and the other $6 million will be earmarked from existing funding under the national mental health strategy. That will come from the money that was announced last year. The funds will be used to trial a number of strategies to specifically address the needs of young people in high risk groups. This includes those people who have previously attempted suicide; young people in rural and remote areas; people with a mental illness; and young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives are likely to include pilot programs with GPs to increase their awareness about youth suicide and to enhance their capacity to deal with these issues, including preventing copycat attempts at suicide. Also, there will be incentive funding to establish and trial follow-up programs for young people who have attempted suicide; piloting of suicide awareness programs as proposed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities; further training and support of health professionals who come into contact with vulnerable young people and their families; and developing, collecting and publishing of data to increase knowledge and understanding of the risk factors associated with youth suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of reducing suicide rates was recognised by the Australian health ministers in the development of national health goals and targets. In 1994 those ministers endorsed a goal for reducing rates. Reports show that young men are six times more likely to commit suicide than young women. When there are anomalies and imbalances in statistics, as we often hear, there is clearly a problem which governments need to address. I believe that we are going some way to doing that in this initiative that was announced in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important initiative which was announced in the budget, particularly for my electorate, was an increase in funding for the development of Badgerys Creek airport, or Sydney West airport as some people call it. Some $762 million will be allocated over the next three or four years to accelerate&mdash;I will not use the term `fast-track'&mdash;the development of Sydney West airport. Obviously, this has been a very topical issue in the last six months because of the concern about aircraft noise in inner Sydney as a result of the third runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am on the public record a number of times as saying that I am one of a number of people in the Labor Party and certainly from New South Wales who has never supported the third runway. We lost that debate back in 1989 when the government decided to build the third runway instead of taking a decision at that time to go ahead with the second Sydney airport. As it has turned out, the need for that second Sydney airport is clear. The government has now decided that we will have a second Sydney airport by 1999, despite the fact that we now also have a third runway at Kingsford Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems of which the government needs to be aware&mdash;I am sure the government is aware of them&mdash;in relation to Badgerys Creek airport, or Sydney West airport. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) was at pains to point out that, in developing Sydney West airport, we need to ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of Kingsford Smith. If there is one issue in my electorate that has engendered a lot of concern and excitement lately, it is the prospect of the same sort of aircraft noise in western Sydney and in parts of the electorate, as there has been, around Marrickville, Leichhardt and Drummoyne in the inner city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not want this level of aircraft noise&mdash;nobody wants it&mdash;but we have to deal with it. We have to provide answers to the communities, certainly to those in the northern part of my electorate&mdash;from Hoxton Park to Warragamba and Silverdale, down to Theresa Park and even parts of Camden and Narellan. These people are genuinely concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party ran a very effective scare campaign in parts of that region in the lead-up to the state election. It did not work that well for the Liberal Party because Labor won the electorate of Badgerys Creek at the state election. Funnily enough, we also won Gladesville, which is under the flight path of Kingsford Smith airport. I am not sure what that says about the politics of aircraft noise in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it is a serious issue and an issue which has raised a lot of concern in the community in my electorate. We are going to have a second Sydney airport. I have always supported the need for a second Sydney airport and the need to get on with Badgerys Creek, which was first announced in 1985&mdash;10 years ago. I still support the concept of a second Sydney airport, but we have to make sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the inner city and have the chaos of the aircraft noise. We need to have some answers from the authorities on where the flight paths will be and what the contours will be. There will be a review of the 1985 EIS. By the end of this year, the residents around the areas that I mentioned will hopefully have a lot more answers on how they will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard to convince people in rural or semi-rural areas that they will be okay and will not be affected badly when, at the moment, they do not have noise from anything. They do not have any aircraft noise. They do not have trains or many cars driving around. They can actually talk to their neighbours 200 metres away because it is so quiet. They are obviously concerned about any prospect of aircraft noise, even if it is not in the 20, 30 or 40 ANEF category. We have to overcome that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the opposition will try to play up that problem, as it already has done. I know the Liberal candidates from areas around my electorate have been trying to beat up the prospect of major aircraft noise problems. I guess it is up to the government and the department, through the various studies and through providing answers to those questions, to allay those fears. It is a very real concern for the people of western and south-west Sydney. Although I have always supported the need for the second airport, we need to make sure that it is not at the expense of the quality of life for the people in those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that I want to talk about is the opposition's obsession with tax increases&mdash;and I have mentioned that. There were some minor tax increases in the budget, as there should be. We often hear from the opposition that the government is dishonest and is a high taxing government. That is nonsense. We are one of the lowest taxed countries in the OECD. Figures show that our taxation rates are the second lowest to Turkey in the OECD countries. There is a good case to argue that we should be paying a lot more tax, particularly those people on higher incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Western Australian Liberal Party believes that Western Australian business people should pay no tax at all. That was well documented in the early 1980s when the powerbroker over there tore strips off the then federal Treasurer and now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) because he was too hard on tax avoidance in Western Australia. We all know the history of that. We had the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, which assisted a lot of people associated with the Liberal Party in Western Australia. When I lived in Western Australia, the Liberal Party had a campaign slogan in the 1970s which was `Taxation is theft'. Let us not forget that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us knock on the head this hypocrisy about taxation. We are the second lowest taxed country in the OECD world. I do not know where people expect governments to get revenue from if it is not from companies and the better off in the community. I certainly support the rise in company tax because I think we all have to pay our fair share, especially those in the community who are better able to do so. The government has very important social justice programs to implement, including those on access to superannuation, mental health, Aboriginal health and youth suicide. We need to have a fair and equitable social security system and fair, flexible and efficient labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money has to come from somewhere. Liberal Party members would have us believe that we pay too much tax in this country. Perhaps if some of their rich mates paid the tax they owe instead of avoiding it through fancy tax avoidance schemes we would not have such a problem with revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation rises announced in the budget are fairly modest. The boost in taxation revenue which the member for Adelaide mentioned is mainly due to the fact that there are more people working. I have met a lot of people who are out of work and they have said that their ambition in life is to pay tax. They are not paying tax because they do not have a job. I think that is a very worthy ambition. The government should be very proud that at least half a million more people in the last two years have jobs and are now paying tax. That is why the government expects over $2 billion more in taxation receipts this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a part of the budget that is of concern to a number of people in the labour movement&mdash;that is, the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I share some of those concerns, but not because I believe the banks are necessarily sacrosanct in terms of needing to be owned by the government. We had the debate about the nationalisation of banks in the 1940s when Ben Chifley was Prime Minister. There are still a lot of people in the labour movement who believe that we should nationalise banks. In reality, that debate was lost in the 1940s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of whether banks, or airlines for that matter, should be publicly or privately owned. It concerns me that in the last few years we have often had the situation where the government has decided to sell off a public asset in order to affect the bottom line in the budget. The surplus of about $700 million in this year's budget is due to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Regardless of the debates about whether or not governments should own banks or airlines, the point is that, if we keep selling off the family silver, what happens when there is none left. How do you affect the bottom line of the budget then? That is an area of concern. I am sure most members of the government would agree with me that there are some areas of government activity that are sacrosanct; whether they relate to banks or airlines is another issue. We could have an intelligent debate about whether or not governments should own banks or airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the Labor government would not go down the track of privatising all schools and hospitals.

One thing about this airconditioning system, which can be compared to the airconditioning system in old Parliament House, is that it seems to be charged with the ability to ensure a good mix of the germs in Australia.

However, on behalf of the battlers, I battle on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995 budget will go down in the economic history books as the one where Labor formally and finally parted company with its platform not just in relation to privatisation but also in relation to social justice and equity, as this budget will increase the gap between rich and poor, which has been this Labor government's tragic hallmark since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted the agony and anguish of the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) with regard to that issue of privatisation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the 13th budget of the federal Labor government. It is the unlucky 13th budget of the federal Labor government. It is the last budget of the federal Labor government. It completely extinguishes for all time Labor's light on the hill. It is not as good as it gets. It may be the Labor Party's best effort in government, but it has been greeted with anger by so many sectors of the economy, by so many people out in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing is that it increases real hardship for the people beyond the big unions, the big institutions, the top end of town. The cold hard facts are that this budget increases the taxes in Australia which impact on those who are not well off. It does that in a way which, for example, sees the Medicare levy go up from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent. That levy is not taken into account with the OECD comparisons. When you add in all the levies, Australia's taxation position is pretty grim when compared with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget increases the sales tax on cars and on building hardware. It denies income tax cuts, and they are used in the community to pay off grocery and everyday living expenses. It tampers with the diesel fuel rebate scheme. I commend members who represent mining seats to have a look at the detail of the legislation now emerging with regard to this budget and look at the crazy situations associated with retrospectivity of considerable concern, specifically for the Pilbara operators in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a Western Australian hate tax for the iron ore industries. The diesel fuel rebate, currently eligible on the Pilbara iron ore trains, is going to be revoked for the trains running in one direction. So the full trains going down will be eligible for the diesel fuel rebate but the empty trains coming back will not be eligible. So we have a new tax on exports in Western Australia, which will affect other mines in Queensland and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget papers detail that real growth in taxation revenue will increase by 10.3 per cent in 1994-95 and, on top of that, by another 9.3 per cent for the next financial year. Given the current inflation environment, that is a giant rip-off by the government. It means bigger government, more taxation and lower disposable incomes for average Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that the overall state of the Australian economy deserves detailed examination. In that context, let me quote what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said on 2 December 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say any economy that can't travel at 4 per cent without spilling over into imports should give the game away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we ought to be able to run this economy at 4 per cent at least, and will need to bring unemployment down in a sustained marked way in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>Given this quote, it should be noted that the growth forecast contained in this budget is some 3 per cent each year from 1995-96 through to 1997-98, and then drifting further down after that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit is expected to increase from 3.9 per cent to six per cent of GDP. In short, we will have a current account deficit, according to the budget, of a whopping and continuing $27 billion. In short, we cannot sustain four per cent, let alone get four per cent, growth without spilling over into imports, sucking in imports at a rate which will affect our current account deficit and our balance of payments. This has been confirmed again by the latest growth figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They confirm that Labor not only is incapable of delivering the performance the Prime Minister himself boasted of but has no intention of delivering that performance. It has in fact deliberately slowed the economy in a way which is not reflecting what is happening at the coal face. It does not reflect the anecdotal evidence, the evidence of members, particularly on this side of the House, who go out and meet their small business operators every weekend. This is a very grim situation. The statistics do not point that out in any real accurate form for some reason or other, perhaps because of the lead time associated with those statistics. But, whether it is the housing and building industry, particularly in south-east Queensland which has been kneecapped by this government's policies, or indeed a lot of small business operators&mdash;even the tourism industry&mdash;1995 has been an extraordinarily tough calendar year to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said in 1992, `What I am promising is not to put up taxes.' This budget has absolutely exposed that to be unbelievable. It is worth carrying Budget Paper No. 1 around your electorate at the moment and carrying it with you to Howard Satler's program or John Laws's program to show them the actual adjusted deficit table. You will find it right up the back. The adjusted ABS budget deficit table No. 2 1995-96 shows a deficit of $8.232 billion. There it is in black and white&mdash;the government's own figuring in the budget statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Embraced in this is this situation with regard to taxation. Labor said during the last federal election that the Medicare levy would not go up. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has made that assertion day in and day out. Yet there in those budget documents was that whack of a 1.4 to 1.5 per cent increase, and its impact will be on people who are least able to afford private health insurance. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) may well laugh at those people dropping out of private health insurance, but that is creating its own agony, its own dynamics. It should be of concern to the government and anyone who would like to think about the strategy for health policy in this country before it is too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Willis) said that the government would never ever sell the Commonwealth Bank. On that, the government has been proved to be totally unbelievable. Just let me remind you that, in demonstrating the total lack of credibility of the government over the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and its duplicity, the Treasurer has since told us that the major parameters of the budget were set by Anzac Day. We know, because the Treasurer has since told us that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) decided on the first day of May, well after the budget was allegedly put to bed, that the government would proceed with the sale of the remaining share of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, because the Treasurer has since told us that the reason for the decision was that it was seen to be psychologically important to be able to say that the budget was in surplus. In other words, the selling of the balance of the Commonwealth Bank was for the sake of appearances. It had nothing to do with the structure of the budget, nothing to do with retiring debt, nothing to do with boosting national savings and nothing to do with cutting government expenditure. It was being done for the sake of appearances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you something else: you have deserted your own constituency with the sale of the balance of the Commonwealth Bank.

Martin Ferguson tried to fudge it and cover up for you and give you a bit of condolence on the matter, but you have walked away from your platform. You have walked away from your constituency.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House may not fully realise that what happened&mdash;and Treasurer Willis has publicly admitted this&mdash;is that the government pulled back a loan early from Queensland, $900 million, just in time for the budget cut-off. That does not help Australia incorporated in one sense because what does Queensland state Treasury now go and do? It has to reissue the debt at the state level. So it was a neat little book entry between mates, between the federal Labor government and Treasurer Willis and Treasurer De Lacy and the Queensland state Labor government. The Queensland electors of Hinkler and Kennedy and other key seats would like to know that they have been used in that way to produce that false surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the election and since the budget the increasingly desperate Prime Minister has gone out on something of a mini-election campaign.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular budget measure has an enormous effect on Australia's trade and requires examination today. It is the three per cent rise in company tax, worth $320 million next financial year and nearly $1.6 billion the year after that. It is more like a large bucket than a fistful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time I have been focusing attention on the loss of market share in certain key markets in Asia. There is an intellectual debate as to what extent that is significant as the nature of the economies in Asia change. But the truth is that we are losing market share. In a broad way our exports to APEC countries have doubled since 1985. The APEC import market itself has almost trebled. Our market share in APEC in that time has slipped from just over four per cent to around three per cent, an effective 25 per cent loss in market share in 10 years when we have supposedly been prioritising Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put it another way. If we had our 1985 share of the APEC market, we would have exported an additional $9 billion worth of Australian exports last year. That would have been a very healthy contribution to our balance of payments. I should not need to remind the House of the enormous effect that additional exports of that magnitude would have on the state of our economy overall. I maintain that the reason we have been losing that market share is simple enough&mdash;lack of true competitiveness in tax treatment, in industrial relations, in transport and across our wharves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Okay, one little step forward is being taken this weekend. We have the One Nation train leaving Brisbane for Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. Let us put that in perspective. That represents the completion of about 20 per cent of the current national standardisation and construction rail task. It is a good step in the right direction. What we did was to standardise Kalgoorlie-Perth. What we did was to standardise Sydney-Melbourne. What we did was to standardise Adelaide-Alice Springs. What we also did was to standardise Broken Hill-Port Pirie. Come in, spinner! Four-fifths of the major standardisation task was done by coalition governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I give credit where it is due. I congratulate the government on the completion of the Melbourne-Adelaide standardisation. I hope our Prime Minister does not derail that train when he grabs that throttle on Sunday in Melbourne. I wonder whether he has a union ticket to drive that particular train for the National Rail Corporation. I gather there will be a Falcon jet down and back. But I will salute that train as it comes through Albury-Wodonga at midnight the night before, and I am pleased to see this step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would make the point that this increase in company tax from 36 per cent to 39 per cent is, once again, hitting out at our international competitiveness. It is putting our taxation regime further out of kilter with that of Asia. It is contrary to what the Prime Minister himself said would be his objective&mdash;and that is, in broad terms, to match Asia; to put down parameters which allow our companies to effectively compete with Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that this is not just about the company tax increase; it is about the government's failure to really address the area of industrial relations reform and to busy itself with achieving true choice on industrial relations reform&mdash;which the coalition stands for. It is pretty simple&mdash;it is the right to belong to a union and the right not to belong to a union in the workplace. I think that is not an unreasonable tenet in Australia in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attaching to that, of course, is also the right for employees to own shares, to get proper pay rises, and the like. In other words, it is a far cry from the poor circumstance argued by some union leaders which saw, very significantly, in the last fortnight, a major walkout on the ACTU by the Transport Workers Union. That reflects the anger and angst in the union areas and the lack of performance of the unions to really latch on to what the agenda should be in the 1990s. I am not anti-union. I simply say that there should be that choice, that degree of spirit of Hilmer competition, if you like, by having the right to belong to a union and the right not to belong to a union in key aspects of the workplace of the Australian economy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend a little bit of time making reference to that surplus because it has been a feature of contributions from members of the Liberal and National parties to seek to attack that surplus figure. The basis of the attack they have made on that surplus relates to asset sales, the proceeds of which are included in that bottom line figure of $718 million surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a rather strange piece of logic, not to mention economic or accounting procedure, to want to extract from the budget income derived from asset sales. I say that because the procedure adopted in this budget is exactly the same procedure adopted in budgets throughout living memory. It is certainly the same procedure adopted in the budgets the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) applied during the 1970s and early 1980s when he was Treasurer and responsible for framing the budget. It is exactly the same process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logic those opposite appear to adopt is that we should not include any money we receive from the sale of assets in calculating the bottom line figure. That is a fairly novel approach. I wonder whether or not those opposite would take the view that we should exclude from our expenditure items the acquisition of equipment and assets which we intend to dispose of at some point in the future. If they want to adopt the logic that we cannot include the income derived from the sale of assets, then surely it follows that we do not include the expenditure outlaid to purchase those very same assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the budget is effectively a statement of income and expenditure. As such, it quite properly records all of those items on which we expect to make payment and it also records the full source of income we expect to receive, from whatever source that income is derived. That is clearly set out in the budget. It was clearly set out in the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to the House when he introduced the budget to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those in the opposition want to adopt the view that asset sales and asset acquisition, and equipment sales and equipment acquisition, should not be included, then they might like to extract from our expenditure the estimate of some $7 billion for purchase of equipment and capital items that is also embedded in that budget. But they do not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) is in the chamber at the moment. I was here listening to his speech yesterday when he used a bit of that contorted and twisted logic to press his political point. If the opposition wants to extract the income we are going to receive this year from those asset sales, let it take out the money we are going to spend on asset acquisitions. If you do that, you will take out about $7 billion because that is roughly the procurement budget of the Commonwealth, excluding agencies such as Telecom. Take the $7 billion out and then do your sums and see what you come up with. Most of those opposite understand that point. They just decide not to enunciate it because it happens not to serve their political purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may also be that many of those opposite do not quite understand what a surplus budget is.

They have not seen a surplus budget, except for the ones this Labor government has produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fairly startling reminder of the sloth and lackadaisical approach to the management of our economy and Australian industry that those opposite adopted. The many years they were in office were, I have to say, comparatively easy years, a period in which world economic growth was far ahead of what we have been able to experience in the world in recent years&mdash;during those boom periods following the Second World War, the 1950s and the 1960s. During that boom period when the Liberal and National parties dominated government they did not have a surplus budget&mdash;not once. Not since Robert Menzies got the idea he would form the Liberal Party did he ever get a surplus budget, nor did any of his successors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as best the records indicate, in that period since the Second World War this represents only the fifth time there has been a surplus Commonwealth budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may not be just mischievous intent on the part of those opposite to mislead people about the nature of the surplus.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefit of producing a surplus budget has been seen in the short term as removing some of the pressure in the money markets on interest rates and relieving some of the pressure on inflation down the track. That is a point which, if not understood by the Liberal Party in this country, has been understood by the analysts both in our markets and abroad. It is noteworthy that, I think it was the day after the budget was delivered, the senior analyst from Moody's in New York made the following comment on an ABC radio program about the budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From our point of view, going to surplus is a good idea no matter how it is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So I think this is an appropriate policy to take under present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>Moody's, one of the chief economic analysts in the world, viewed our budget and believed, in its words, that it was `an appropriate policy to take under present circumstances'. It went further because that interview also dealt with the current account. I do not propose to dwell at length on the current account, but it is worth noting the analysis of Moody's in respect of this government's performance, particularly in this budget, in dealing with the current account. The senior analyst said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the best way to try to deal with a current account deficit is to try and reduce the Government deficit. As a result, I don't know what else you could ask the Government to do to try to deal with a current account deficit, the size of which no one, as far as I know, had really predicted a year or so ago.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have the assessment of the senior analyst at Moody's in New York on the key aspects of the budget. There is no doubt in my mind, nor in the minds of the great majority of my constituents in Brisbane, that the budget has enabled them to have greater security in seeking home loans and in seeking to pay off those loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the budget we have witnessed a reduction in a range of interest rate packages across virtually all the major banks. That has been a factor of this government's budget producing a surplus, which the markets understand even if the Liberal Party does not. It has also been a factor of the changing world economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have managed to do that while at the same time maintaining very substantial economic growth. Economic growth in the year just ended has been at about 4 3/4  per cent. That is a rate of growth which most would regard as unsustainable in the long term. It is certainly a rate of growth that no other Western economy is able to match. In the budget that we are now discussing, the projection for economic growth in the year ahead is 3 3/4  per cent; a figure which, on the figures announced this week, is clearly achievable. The outcome of a 3 3/4  per cent growth rate is one that every other country in the OECD would give its right arm to achieve. There is probably only one other country in the OECD that will achieve a growth similar to ours, and that is the United States of America. Not one European economy will achieve that outcome. Certainly, Japan will not be able to achieve that sort of economic growth in the year ahead. We will and that, of course, is a slower rate of growth than we achieved in the last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That produces possibly the most important outcome in terms of policy, and that is more jobs. This government, through its broad range of policies but not least of all through its budget policies, has seen the development of more jobs in this country in the last two years than in any period in the post-1960s era. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election, we undertook to provide an additional 500,000 jobs for Australians over the three-year period. We have exceeded that in less than two years. In less than two years we reached a target which those opposite, the Liberal and National parties, said could not be achieved. They said we could not create half a million jobs in three years; we did it in two years. By the time that three-year mark comes around, that jobs target will clearly be well beyond 500,000. Indeed, it is already well beyond that 500,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the unemployment rate has turned. It has now fallen to around 8.7 per cent and is continuing to fall. That is good news for Australian working people and that is good news for Australian families. Those two points alone stand out: to ensure job security and opportunity for employment for ordinary Australian men and women, and to provide some certainty about the cost of money. This ensures that the charges they have to pay in the form of interest to the bank when they want to buy a car, a house, go on a holiday or for any other reason they take out a loan are not rising. In fact, interest rates are now on a downward trend. Those two fundamentals have been put in place and are supported by this budget. In the short time since the budget came out it is clear that our policies have had a positive impact on the market. </PARA>

It shows, for example, the manufacturing sector in Australia, a sector which languished for decades under a moribund economy which the opposition ran, now growing in the last year at seven per cent. The hospitality sector, which is very important to the tourism industry and an important industry in my home state of Queensland, is growing at 7.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me the most pleasing aspect is the growth in communications services, because I think the information technology and communication industries will provide a huge backbone for the future development of the Australian economy and the wealth, quite frankly, that our children will depend upon. The communications industry grew in the last year by a massive 13.9 per cent. That growth is no accident: it is the clear result of government fiscal policies and industry policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to a couple of the major initiatives outlined in the budget that I think are genuine, great Labor reforms. Foremost amongst those is superannuation. Superannuation was something that only a few years ago public servants and senior executives had but no-one else enjoyed. I can recall when the trade union movement, together with the Labor government, embarked upon a program of industry superannuation in the 1980s. It was decried by those opposite and by their colleagues in the employer associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to bear in mind that this was during the period when Australia had more money circulating than most of our entrepreneurs knew what to do with. At that time, the cry from the opposition, the cry from the conservatives, was, `We can't afford superannuation for all Australians. You'll wreck business and you'll wreck the economy. We can't afford it.' Their view was, and I believe still is, that we can afford it for their mates who are the business executives, we can afford it for people who are wealthy self-employed, we can afford it for public servants and we can afford it for ourselves&mdash;it is okay for politicians to have superannuation&mdash;but the moment we want to give it to every worker in Australia they suddenly say, `No. The country can't afford it for them; we can only afford it for the privileged one-third.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the position in 1986 when we as a labour movement embarked upon a process of transforming retirement incomes, providing ordinary Australians with genuine hopes for a secure financial future. We took that one step further in this parliament with our superannuation legislation when it became clear that the industrial awards were not providing the full coverage that we had hoped. Again the Liberal Party opposed it, and again it was the same approach, `It's okay for us and our mates to have superannuation, but don't give it to the ordinary workers. Not on your nelly!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget we have taken it one leap forward. In this budget the government is committed to match dollar for dollar superannuation contributions of ordinary working men and women of Australia on a very generous basis&mdash;up to three per cent of their salary. That means that, for workers earning up to about $66,000, the government will subsidise, it will put money in to top up, the contributions that individual employees are making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That dollar for dollar subsidy will apply in full up to that three per cent of wages for people earning about 1.4 times average weekly earnings, and in today's dollars that represents about $46,000 per annum. All Australians earning $46,000 or less in today's dollar terms will see their superannuation contributions matched dollar for dollar up to three per cent. That then tapers off to cut out people whose incomes are around $66,000. That is a very generous tapered income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the other great reforms in this budget is the introduction of the maternity allowance&mdash;a benefit, again, to ordinary families in Australia. It will be a lump sum in today's dollars of $816 payable in one payment to all families with children born after 1 February next year. Again, that is based on a very generous income test. It will go to families earning up to $61,000&mdash;a very generous ceiling&mdash;to ensure that the great bulk of Australian families will receive an up-front financial cash benefit at a time when there are significant costs. I can attest to those significant costs as I have a seven-month-old baby at home. I fully appreciate the value that that $816 will have to many Australians when they have a new born in the house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area which I believe the budget makes provision for and which is proud Labor policy is the substantial allocation of funds to improve the protection of our environment. The budget allocates over $220 million. I am delighted to say a substantial proportion of that will go to a new project: a major initiative for coastal management in Australia. It is long overdue, I must say. I think coastal management, as part of the environment debate, has tended to fall behind the high public profile of trees and some of the more graphic pictorials. I am delighted to see that this government has committed a major amount of money&mdash;in excess of $50 million&mdash;to a coastal management program to protect that important part of our environment. Again, as a Queensland member I must say it is a part of the environment greatly enjoyed by people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families come out of this budget, I believe, as substantial beneficiaries of our programs. They come out with greater job security&mdash;more jobs for the unemployed and more certainty of their own position being maintained. They enjoy the knowledge that interest rates are now clearly under control and falling. They can go to work in the comfort of the knowledge that on their retirement they will have some security through the superannuation system, which Labor and only Labor has fostered in this country. Never in the history of the superannuation debate has the Liberal Party had the wit, much less the commitment, to support the superannuation reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Labor, families and individuals will know they have financial security and certainty in retirement. They know that Medicare is being preserved, that it will maintain its universal nature and that there has been the slightest of increases. The Medicare levy will rise from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent&mdash;a 0.1 per cent increase&mdash;to ensure what is, in my view, the best health system in the world. I have mentioned the maternity allowance. A national child immunisation program and improved cervical cancer screening programs are some of the fundamentally important activities this budget supports for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt this budget has been well received by the Australian people. It has been well received by the bulk of the markets and the financial commentators abroad who understand the importance of the surplus we have generated. It will provide an ongoing basis for economic growth and prosperity not only for this generation but, by virtue of superannuation, for future generations. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1995-96 budget is the 13th of this Keating Labor government. It comes at a time when Australia is facing some very serious problems&mdash;most notably a forecast of a $27 billion current account deficit in this almost completed financial year and very likely marked increases in inflation combined with a wages break-out that might result in the loss of many thousands of jobs in small business, which provides 47 per cent of all jobs and which has been the fastest growing sector of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget includes an extra $6.1 billion in tax on wages and salary earners, an extra $2.4 billion in sales tax on everything from screws and nails to new cars and an extra $2.4 billion in company tax. This is also a budget where, tucked away on an obscure page, we find the government stating that it expects the amount of interest it pays on its debt to be up a massive 31 per cent this year to about $9.3 billion dollars&mdash;that is an extra $2 billion or so over and above last year's figure&mdash;and Australians are continuing to live with this on the international bank card far too much. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) seems to be out of touch with reality and, most importantly, he has fudged the figures in this budget with his $700 million surplus that is really an $8 billion deficit&mdash;a point I will return to later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer remarked that passenger motor vehicle sales are at a high level. That is not correct. New car sales in 1993-94 were 475,000 compared with 471,000 in the last full year of the federal coalition government in 1981-82 when Australia's population was only 15.1 million compared with the 17 million today. In other words, over the last 12 years our population went up by 12 per cent but sales of new cars rose by less than one per cent. Over the 11 full financial years the Labor Party has been in government, the average number of new cars sold has been only 449,000 a year, which makes the picture even worse. New car sales have actually gone backwards in Labor's time in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate on some of the effects of this budget on the electorate of Isaacs. Isaacs is notable in that it contains an older established area in the suburbs of Mentone, Mordialloc, Chelsea and parts of Cheltenham, and a much younger area focusing on Aspendale Gardens, Carrum Downs, Cranbourne and Patterson Lakes. Cranbourne is the third fastest growing area in Australia. The first budgetary measure of concern to my constituents is the imposition of a sales tax on building joinery products. As Les Groves of the Housing Industry Association said, this tax may well raise $550 million in the 1995-96 budget, rather than the $215 million forecast by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor says that this additional sales tax will cost new home buyers only $400. Master Builders Australia and the Housing Industry Association, however, disagree. Studies done by the two say that the cost of a typical new home will rise by $1,000. The study says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The building tax is not part of a tax reform package . . . it is just a goods and services tax by stealth . . . just more tax on home buyers and the building industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Many home buyers in Isaacs will have signed contracts for new homes but will find that the final bill from their builders will rise. When this happens, I am worried that many of my constituents will have borrowed close to the maximum allowed by their banks, building societies or credit unions and will suddenly find themselves having to go back, cap in hand, to the financial institution asking it for an increase in their loan figures. Obtaining approval for a higher loan may in fact in some cases be difficult for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new Labor sales tax on building materials will apply on screws, nails, paint, putty, adhesives, wallpaper, ceramics, glass, floor tiles, wall tiles, taps, nozzles, handles, parquetry and joinery. So it will also affect the large number of people who undertake kitchen or bathroom renovations or who want to paint their weatherboard houses. Mr Keith Daws of Carrum Kitchens is an example of a business hit hard by Labor. Mr Daws said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since Christmas, with interest rates having gone up, it has just died . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Daws leased a new saw in June last year, which costs him $800 a month, and for the past two months the saw has lain idle. Mr Daws, who has run his own business for several years, wants an environment where he has some certainty, but he says that all we seem to get is short booms punctured by even longer busts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Caratello of Robecraft Industries in Mordialloc, whose business has been established since 1968, said, `Mr Keating wants to kill the backbone of this country.' Isn't it interesting that we have not heard government members quoting from members of the community in their speeches on the budget? This is one of the areas that really does concern us. It addresses the area of small business. Mr Chris Arnold of Complete Kitchens in Cranbourne, who has a staff of 16 people, says that he wishes the industry could have been given more notice of just what the government had been proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from housing, another important goal of many Australians is to drive a new car. The increase in Labor's sales tax from 16 to 21 per cent on budget night and then to 22 per cent on 1 July is a cruel blow to private new car buyers. One car dealer said to me that his business has turned into a morgue since the budget. Every passenger vehicle is affected. Once the price of the vehicle is above $34,403, the remainder attracts sales tax at 45 per cent&mdash;not 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major car dealer in my electorate said to me that 30 of his customers were affected by the sales tax hike announced on budget night. He said that these customers had been waiting the usual time of between four and six weeks for their new cars. Three-quarters of these car buyers were not trying to beat any rumoured budget tax increases. They were just trying to place orders in the usual way after making a decision to commit to a new car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Simon Jefferson of Jefferson Ford in Mentone said that on the Saturday after the budget he sold 11 used cars compared with his usual total of about six used cars and six new cars. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sure knows how to reduce the sales of new cars. Of course, the price increase of $600 to $700 for a smaller car or $1,000 for a larger vehicle will feed through to potential used car buyers. Because the increase in sales tax on motor vehicles applied from budget night, dealers' customers have had to pay immediately and in most cases unexpectedly $1,000 extra on what was, say, a $28,300 new car. Dealers' phones have been running hot from disgusted customers in this invidious position. Sadly, the types of calls any business loves&mdash;that is, inquiries about new cars&mdash;have been almost non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's attitude to the collection of sales tax is that its interpretation of the law must be upheld. Tucked away on page 4.15 of statement No. 1 is the flagging of some amendments to the law. In the words of the government these amendments `seek to maintain the wholesale sales tax base or to restore it to where it was prior to recent court decisions'. If a taxpayer takes the Commonwealth to court and wins a case, the Labor government will not accept the umpire's decision, arrived at after careful consideration of the facts. Instead, it will just amend the laws in the future so that an exemption from sales tax for, say, metal shelving does not extend to scaffolding. It is a `heads I win, tails I win' approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has repeatedly claimed since budget night that the small reduction in fixed loan housing rates announced on 12 May by three banks and Westpac's one-third of a percentage point reduction in its variable home rate were evidence that this budget would lead to lower interest rates. This claim is a terrific example of the fact that if you repeat a lie long enough it will be believed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that the Prime Minister of this country has been responsible for three rises in interest rates on home loans since August last year, pushing up the cost of a $100,000 home by $120 a month in extra payments. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 15 May said:</PARA>

<PARA>The chief economist of economic forecaster BIS Shrapnel said that rates will go higher before the end of the year. He suggested that the current interest rate lull would further increase Australia's current account deficit or the amount we owe in net terms to the rest of the world. This would push up the inflation rate, ensuring further interest rate rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 29 May announcement of a $2.25 billion current account deficit for April will act to keep further pressure on the dollar. So far this year, with two months to go, Australia is effectively in hock to the rest of the world for a further $21 billion, up a staggering 59 per cent on the same period last year. On 16 May Mr Ed Shann, the Director of Access Economics, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think rates have peaked as inflation is still likely to rise further.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is still too early to tell when the peak in rates will be&mdash;the futures market has still allowed another 12 to 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA>We should all remember that in a recent survey of 25 of Australia's leading economists, 22 said they believed interest rates would rise before the end of the year. That will affect home buyers, who have already been hit badly by this Labor government. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 29 May, Fred Benchley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent OECD studies indicate that Australian nominal interest rates may have remained high because markets have a poor view of the credibility of Australian authorities in controlling inflation. Put simply, investors have been demanding a risk premium.</PARA>
<PARA>I will say it even more simply: the people who really determine the interest rates we pay do not believe the statements of the Treasurer or the Reserve Bank. Small business employs 47 per cent of Australia's work force. It is a disgrace that shortly after the budget the Prime Minister had the gall to say in Brisbane, `This is as good as it gets.' He said, `Any small business proprietors who are finding the going tough at the moment should cease business'&mdash;in other words, stop trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition certainly does not believe that in 1995 it is as good as it can get for small business. How can the Prime Minister say that this is as good at it gets, when the government he leads has just announced sales tax increases that will hurt small businesses in the housing and construction sector? This is a government that thinks an unemployment rate of close to nine per cent is heaven; in the United States, the rate is under six per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A worse example of how this government treats small business and stops honest Australians from increasing their productivity by helping us compete with the United States, Europe and Asia has been hidden away on page 11 of the Treasurer's statement. The Treasurer claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years evidence has emerged of an erosion of the PAYE tax base, where individuals have attempted to move out of traditional employer/employee relationships in order to avoid tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Government will be amending the income tax law to ensure the intended coverage of the PAYE provisions can be enforced.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard this all before. All of us remember this government's attack on legitimate contractors in the building industry. The contractors' good work has kept housing prices below what they would be if employees worked from only nine to five before becoming eligible for overtime. Employees, along with their employers, are mindful of the benefits they can get from entering into contracts. Witness how former hard-core unionists in the Pilbara iron ore companies in the west deserted their union en masse and became more involved members of their companies while winning significant increases in pay and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the Treasurer's evidence that the pay-as-you-earn tax base of wage and salary earners has been eroding? In the last two years, gross pay collections have risen from $43 billion to $48 billion&mdash;by over 10 per cent. In both 1992-93 and 1994-95 PAYE tax collected was equivalent to 11.2 per cent of government revenue. In 1993-94 it dipped slightly to 11 per cent, but this year&mdash;in 1995-96&mdash;it is forecast to rise to 11.7 per cent. Where is the erosion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contractors have a right to be treated as contractors and not as employees. The Treasurer's words in the budget mark the start of another assault by the government and the ACTU on the three-quarters of the Australian population who work in the private sector. Yet the ACTU officially represents only a quarter of all private sector employees. As a local accountant said to me, the government is attempting to dictate how a business person should set up a business. This measure will destroy hundreds of thousands of legitimate businesses from having a go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said late last year when local Braeside company John Richmond Manufacturing was under siege from Bill Shorten&mdash;one of the ACTU's recruits who was going around to local businesses aggressively trying to sign up new unionists, even if the employees had no history of being in a union&mdash;what gain is there for Australian companies if they are subjected to this type of union blackmail?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that occurs, it will be one more nail in the coffin of local manufacturing industry jobs. Allied with a whole lot of other areas in which Australia is uncompetitive&mdash;our just increased company tax of 35 per cent compares with 16.5 per cent in Hong Kong, for instance&mdash;discouraging the use of contract labour just ensures that more Australian jobs are sent overseas. With some effort they could be retained in Australia, and that is without even considering the carrot that other countries hold out to entice Australian companies such as tax free breaks, cheaper land, no payroll taxes and no taxes on bank accounts&mdash;to name just a few of the incentives. We also should not forget that between 1982-83 and 1993-94 the cost of collecting tax revenue went from 94c in every $100 to $1.22 in every $100. So the tax office has been arguably less efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of the Commonwealth Bank was done without any consultation with Labor's cabinet, except the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), its back bench or the Australian public. The backbenchers found out about the sale of the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank at 6.45 p.m. on budget night, when the budget papers had been long printed. At least when the Labor Party in Victoria was forced to sell the then State Bank to the Commonwealth Bank, we all had a bit of an idea beforehand that this would occur. With this 1994-95 proposed Commonwealth Bank sale, there was no forewarning except the correct prediction from the astute Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). There are some real questions that need to be answered with respect to that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the proximity of the Moorabbin airport to the electorate of Isaacs, many of my constituents are operators of air related businesses and their employees. The budget proposes to raise an additional $23 million in 1995-96 from the customs and excise duties on avgas and turbine fuel to pay for Civil Aviation Authority cost recovery. The duty on avgas and turbine fuel is rising 0.9c a litre as of 1 July. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Australia rightly suggests that this is yet another subsidy from the general aviation sector to the large commercial airlines. I call upon the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to again look at how heavily his government is taxing the general aviation sector.

With Qantas alone having been proposed for sale in each of the last four years, and never sold, my constituents could be excused for wondering how this government could again falsely count in these possible proceeds as delivering a budget surplus?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just let me comment on the unbridled pessimism of the Liberal member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson). He certainly does attack the government on a wide variety of fronts, but one particular element of his attack related to levels of taxation. I find this surprising, because in Victoria we have one of the biggest taxing state governments in the Commonwealth. If we look back through history at the performance of the Fraser-Howard government, it indeed was a big taxing Liberal government. I am quite surprised that the honourable member for Isaacs should be wallowing in pessimism, as Liberal members often do when they rise in these debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget which the Treasurer brought down in May has several key goals and objectives. It seeks to continue the strong pattern of economic growth that has been evident in the Australian economy over the last three years and to bring that growth to sustainable levels over time. The budget seeks to reduce pressures on interest rates and to sustain the very strong employment growth that we have experienced here in Australia compared to other OECD countries. The budget gives a considerable boost to national savings and it contains a plethora of measures that support Australian families. Indeed this budget will deliver strong support to Geelong working people and their families and it will deliver strong support to Geelong business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased at the budget initiatives that will further Labor's social justice agenda, in particular, the programs of support that can be accessed by people from non-English speaking backgrounds. If we look at the general budget parameters, the government has brought the budget into surplus some three years ahead of expectation. This has moderated pressure on interest rates and has sustained economic growth and patterns of low inflation that have emerged in the Australian economy, and the budget projects the Australian economy to grow by some 3 3/4 per cent in the coming year. Employment growth in the year to March 1995 came in at 4.2 per cent. The government is well ahead of its jobs target of creating 500,000 jobs in three years; we have created over 600,000 jobs in a little over two years, and that is an excellent achievement for any government in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal specifically with the boost to national savings which is contained in this budget. Here I direct my comments to members opposite because in 1983, after years of Liberal neglect, less than 40 per cent of employees had any sort of superannuation coverage at all; today 90 per cent of employees have superannuation. The figures are even more significant when we look at the participation of women in superannuation. Back in 1983 only 24 per cent of women in the work force had access to superannuation and now it is 85 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a comprehensive retirement incomes policy which is based on an age pension, which has increased significantly in real terms since Labor came to power in 1983, and on the great plank of superannuation advances which have been effected by this government. The new initiatives will lift the superannuation savings for people on average weekly earnings to a minimum of 15 per cent of their wages. I know there are many working families in the Geelong region who will benefit considerably by the extension of superannuation to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased with the agenda for Geelong families which was announced in this budget.

The budget introduces a new maternity allowance of $816 for families having babies which will be paid to women at home or women in paid employment who have children. The parenting allowance, the Working Nation initiative, will be introduced from July 1995. Some 115,000 low income earners&mdash;battlers&mdash;will receive average gains of up to $59 per week.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the health area the budget introduces a national childhood immunisation program and provides $11 million for that purpose in 1995-96.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's record on families sits in stark contrast to the opposition's purported support for families. It is a cause for concern that the Leader of the Opposition can come to this place and indulge in a massive exercise of hypocrisy when he talks about the coalition's concern for families. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who wanted at the last election to bring in an industrial relations policy that would see the wages and salaries of low income earners in this country slashed, and families suffer as a result. This was the same Leader of the Opposition who in this place and in public life over the past 10 to 12 years has consistently opposed any wage increases for low income earners in Australia. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who brought before the Australian people at the last election a massive program of slashing government expenditure and programs directed at assisting families in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We witness unbridled hypocrisy by the Leader of the Opposition when he talks about the opposition's concern and support for Australian families. This contrasts rather sharply with the measures that have been taken by Labor in power since 1983 to deliver an extensive range of programs that support Australian families and, through the industrial relations system, protect their award provisions and incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, the nation's economic future lies in the growth of its regions. Like yourself, I represent in this place one of the great economic regions of the Commonwealth. The economic development of those regions is well supported by the budget measures the government has put in place. The economy of regions is supported in two very specific ways. The general economic context is very favourable for the growth of regional economies. Economic growth is predicted to increase by 3 3/4 per cent. We have managed like no other government in Australia's post-war history to break the back of inflation in this country, and inflation is projected to remain low in comparative terms to our trading partners. We have seen a moderation in the level of interest rates. Industrial disputation is low and the productivity of Australian enterprises is showing considerable gains. This means that there will be sustained demand for goods and services for the businesses that exist in regional areas such as Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased with the specific regional initiatives that are contained in this budget. The government will provide $48 million over four years to support a local government development program. We will see a continuation of the regional development program in Working Nation which has provided  $150 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very important provision of that program is the allocations that have been made for infrastructure developments in the regions. I am particularly pleased that the government has continued the better cities program, which has been of such benefit to Geelong. The Deakin Woolstores project, the housing redevelopment at Norlane and the transport interchange in the centre of Geelong were all projects which were funded by the better cities program. We have a few more projects on the drawing board, such as the civic precinct, which will add so much to the cultural life of the Greater City of Geelong. So I am very pleased that that program was continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also heartened by the government's measures in the budget to assist textile, clothing and footwear industries with the TCF 2000 industry development strategy. The government intends to outlay some $33 million over five years, and that program is aimed at improving the competitiveness of that sector. The particular areas that the program will be aimed at addressing are: improving managerial competency and leadership within those industries; ensuring that, within TCF industries, there is a strong commitment to quality; the adoption of best practice and benchmarking; and, of course, the training needs of that particular sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to report to the House that, over the last six months, there have been announced in the Geelong region some very significant investment projects that will drive the local regional economy faster and provide job security for workers in the region. Rohm &amp; Haas has just opened a new $5 million chemical storage facility as part of a $30 million investment in Geelong. Geelong Village Cinemas is undergoing a $5 million redevelopment, which will add much to the cultural life of Geelong. The transport interchange has an investment of $16.25 million. The Commonwealth is building a manufacturing industry training centre of some $20 million. Austanners has moved to Geelong in a two-staged redevelopment, with a total investment of $16 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute here to the state government and the allocation of its $15 million to Steampacket Place. The federal government has put some $10 million into the redevelopment of the Deakin Woolstores. The BHP plant in Geelong has signalled an expansion of $23 million. The HiFert company has, over recent times, initiated investments of some $10 million. There has been $10 million invested in a new Hoechst in Lara, and a</PARA>
<PARA>Cadsan investment in a wool spinning facility of over $20 million. They are sizeable investments in the regional economy and signal a very important growth for the Geelong region in the next 12 to 15 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly happy with the justice program that was initiated in this budget. The government's Justice Statement seeks to make justice more accessible and affordable to Australian families, and we have undertaken to spend $160 million over four years to achieve this goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to canvass all of the elements of that statement, but let me just pick up on a few. The statement has a focus on relationships. It doubles the number of places available in relationship courses. It increases access to family support programs for non-English speaking background families. It provides funding for eight more family therapy centres to assist with youth mediation. It also expands financial counselling assistance to families to assist them in the management of their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as family law is concerned, we have provided $4.3 million over four years to the Family Court to resolve disputes through mediation, rather than litigation. I do not think anybody in this House would disagree with that particular initiative. We have provided $16.8 million over four years to increase the number of community based mediators. We have expanded the Family Court's counselling service by $13.5 million, and we have provided that court with more staffing and more resources to deal with its backlog. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as violence prevention is concerned, we are establishing handover centres for safe transfers of children. We have provided $2 million over four years to family support programs to address violence in the home. This particular package of measures will be welcomed by low income earners and people in the Geelong area. It is a very important plank of our social justice agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I make reference to the government's social justice statement that it produced with the budget in 1995-96, particularly the provisions it makes for access and equity to Commonwealth programs, particularly for people from non-English speaking backgrounds. The government believes that all Australians are entitled to benefit equitably from resources managed by the government on behalf of the community. Recently, after widespread consultations with people from the non-English speaking background sector, we have committed to deliver improvements in the area of access to labour market programs in the legal area and in the area of health and human services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next three years we will work closely with people from the migrant communities to extend their access to Commonwealth programs and the equity in the delivery of those services to all Australians. As I said at the start of this contribution to the debate on the appropriation bills, this is a budget for all Australians. Particularly, it is a good budget for people in the Geelong region. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party of old, the party that really cared for the working people and the battlers of this country, according to its own mythology, is gone.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great betrayal has occurred because the Labor Party is today led by the great betrayer, the Prime Minister, who indulges himself with a Louis XIV lifestyle and who has recently, as we all read in the press, quadrupled his investment in a company which is still struggling to survive under the difficulties it is facing. He has quadrupled his investment in ways which most Australians would find quite astonishing and astounding. It is no wonder that this budget is a budget which is grossly out of touch with the needs of the country and fails to address those needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the measure of the betrayal in the portfolios for which I have particular responsibility, those of employment and family services. The number of unemployed people in Australia today is higher than it was when the Labor Party came to power. It is higher than it was at the peak of the recession of the early 1980s. The number of people who are long-term unemployed is higher now than it was at the peak of the 1980s. The number of young people&mdash;teenagers&mdash;out of work and looking for work is higher now than it was at the peak of the last recession of the 1980s.

Let us subject this figure of 600,000 new jobs to a bit of scrutiny and let us put it in a proper perspective. Let us ask how many new jobs there are in Australia today compared with the number of jobs there were before the Prime Minister's recession&mdash;the recession we were never going to have and the recession in the end that we had to have. Let us compare the number of jobs today with the number of jobs that there were before that recession. Let us cut back that number of 600,000 by virtually half because in Australia today there are only 327,000 more jobs than there were&mdash;</PARA>

There have been 327,000 new jobs since July 1990, not enough new jobs to keep up with the growth in the labour force since July 1990. Before the Prime Minister's recession the unemployment rate was seven per cent. What is it in Australia today? It is 8.3 per cent. The number of jobs and the growth in the economy has not been sufficient to meet the demand from the growing labour force in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the great achievement that the Prime Minister is bragging about around the country today, and it is no wonder that people do not believe him. It is no wonder that his credibility is at an all-time low. It does not matter what he says about the budget, it does not matter how he misrepresents the situation in the country, people have seen him long enough. They have had 13 years to make an assessment of this man and they know exactly how to assess the rhetoric that he pours out and changes according to circumstances from week to week, month to month and year to year. The government has not even yet rolled back the effects of the recession. Unemployment is still higher than it was when the recession began. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this in Australia has been absolutely devastating&mdash;and particularly on the people who used to vote for the Labor Party, particularly in the inner suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. We have recently had the study released by two highly respected academics, Gregory and Hunter, on the huge gap which has opened up between the more well-to-do and the less well-to-do areas of Australia's great cities. And what did they say about the Prime Minister's Australia and the 13 years of Labor policy? They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were surprised and alarmed at the extent of the changes for the worse which have occurred since the 1970s</PARA>
<PARA>Their study points out that a key factor in this widening gap has been what they describe as the `very poor' employment growth in the Australian economy. They say that between 1976 and 1991, adjusting for employment growth, full-time jobs fell 12 per cent. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the shortage of jobs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>there are over two million people out there who want more paid work according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics than they can currently find&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the proportion of women employed in the labour market is substantially less than in 1976.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard all this talk about growing employment opportunities for women. Those opportunities have been confined to certain areas of this society, but for half of Australian neighbourhoods the proportion of women employed in the labour market is less than in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the great betrayal that has been taking place in this country, and the budget was the opportunity to do something, to give recognition to the financial problems that are currently being faced by small business and by the battling families out there in the real world that the Prime Minister has lost touch with. And what was his answer to these families in this situation? To raise taxes. To make life more expensive for them. To cut back their access to child care. To rip $1.2 billion out of the Working Nation programs to help the unemployed. That was his answer to them, because he was more interested in what the reaction of the financial markets might be. He had to bring down a budget that looked plausible to the financial markets, and he has totally forgotten the impact of that budget on the real lives of families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what was the business reaction? What was the reaction of those people who are ultimately going to have to provide the jobs? What did they have to say about the budget? The budget was panned by every major industry and business organisation in this country. What did the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry say about the budget? I read from the press release it issued on budget night:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Budget has failed to meet the benchmarks which business stated were essential requirements for sound economic management.</PARA>
<PARA>By pumping up taxes, by ignoring the needs of business, the government places in jeopardy the economic recovery and future employment. Business will not accept any responsibility if unemployment rises or the recovery slows. I quote from the Business Council of Australia press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Business Council of Australia has expressed disappointment with the Commonwealth's 1995-96 Budget presented by the Treasurer this evening. The increased revenue measures&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the higher taxes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of $2.4 billion fall primarily on business and are a disguised attack on the present and future incomes of ordinary Australians. They will reduce the income of self-financed retirees, and the capital value and future growth of the superannuation investments of those presently in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA>The Business Council of Australia went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These revenue measures are also an attack on jobs. The corporate tax increase will reduce the funds companies have available for investment and job creation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the reaction of those organisations and institutions in our society which have the capacity and the desire to get out there and provide opportunities for all those people whose lives have been devastated by the economic mismanagement of the last 13 years. They say there is no encouragement in this budget to provide those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we had the release of the national accounts. Once again we had the fantasy land rhetoric of the Treasurer saying, in words that are familiar to us from the Prime Minister's rhetoric, `These are good numbers, these are terrific accounts.' This is how out of touch this man is that he can say, `They show a slowing in the growth of the economy.' That is great news for the unemployed out there: the government has not been able to put in place policies that will enable that growth to be sustained. That is what we have been saying about its economic policies for a long time now. It does not know how to secure sustained economic growth and, because it does not know how to do that, it has not been able to give people the opportunities and the guarantee and the confidence that more and more jobs will come into existence, the jobs that they are desperately looking for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do these figures show? It is interesting to read in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> the comment of Tim Colebatch&mdash;a journalist who is not disinclined to look at the good side of figures from the point of view of the government's policies. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is just unthinkable that we could end up in another recession. But it now looks as though the brakes were slammed on too hard last year. Confidence has suffered, real activity has declined . . . and a steep fall in job growth is just around the corner.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the job growth that the Prime Minister has been promoting since the election. These figures show that the trend rate of growth has slowed sharply from an annualised growth rate of 6.4 per cent in the June quarter to 2.25 per cent in the latest quarter. More than two-thirds of the growth in the economy that these figures show over the last year occurred in the six months to September. Since that time, the economy's growth rate has slowed very sharply indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures show that business investment in new machinery fell three per cent in the March quarter, after growing 32 per cent in the previous year; that imports climbed further; and that household savings&mdash;the savings of Australia's families battling to plan for the future&mdash;fell to 2.8 per cent of disposable income. That is the lowest level on record. After 13 years under the Australian Labor Party, with unemployment higher than it was at the last recession, with programs being slashed to fund the Prime Minister's pet projects, household savings in Australia are at the lowest level on record. Yet everybody agrees that this nation needs more savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the Prime Minister can offer are incredible, unbelievable promises that he says will be delivered in about 30 or 40 years time. `Look to the future' is what the government's message is today. The government says to the people, `In 20 or 30 years everything will be terrific. We've got all these great schemes in place to fix it up. Don't look at the unemployment rate now. Don't compare it with the unemployment rate a few years ago. Don't think about the 70 per cent unemployment amongst youth in inner Melbourne. Just think what the unemployment rate is going to be after the year 2000.' That is if we ever get there, because the rate of growth over the last year, pumped up by the unbridled spending of the government and the Prime Minister, is now coming to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the figures that are now coming in, responsible economic commentators are flagging the possibility of another recession. That totally reinforces the warnings from every major business organisation in the country that this is a budget which is bad for employment. Nothing is more vital to the future of Australian families than sustained economic growth with many more jobs coming through than are coming through at the moment. Why are those jobs not being created? It is because this is a hobbled economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business, which would love to create jobs, cannot do so because there are chains around its ankles. Those chains are made up of links. Those links include legislation with names like `Laurie Brereton's industrial relations legislation', taxes which have enormous compliance costs, and a tonne of paperwork which lands on their desks every time small business even thinks of taking on an apprentice or a trainee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This economy is hobbled. The overseers of these hobbled small businesses rattling along under the laws and regulations that have been put on them are the Prime Minister and his mates in the ACTU. They are keeping a very close eye on what people in small business are doing today. They do not want to see enterprise flexibility agreements that are really flexible and that will allow productivity to rise in the workplace. They do not want to see young people getting training in the numbers that are so desperately needed out there. They want to see training schemes, regulation and industrial relations systems which preserve their power, because they are there cracking the whip. They have been cracking that whip for the past 13 years, and they have made sure that this country is run according to their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen, people such as the Prime Minister have got a very good lifestyle out of that kind of government. But that kind of government has got nothing whatever to do with the lives of ordinary people in this country. That is why there is this tremendous response to John Howard. Out there, people see that this man does know: he lives out there; he understands these people and these families. He is the voice and the spokesman for all those people whom the Morgan polls show as seeing that this budget is much more likely to increase unemployment than to diminish it. He is the voice of those people. And, believe me, that voice is going to be heard very loudly and clearly over the coming months because the 13 years of gross and selfish mismanagement of this country, mismanagement which has created the widening gap between rich and poor, is just about coming to an end.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do that, I would like to quote from a booklet that was printed at the same time as the budget entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An agenda for families</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA>In other words, savings are a problem. Of course, that is one of the reasons why this government addressed the issue of  superannuation with a national superannuation strategy to support wage earners, low income earners. I might remind this House that a national superannuation strategy was last proposed by the Whitlam government. As a matter of fact, Gough Whitlam called for a national superannuation scheme to be researched and, as a consequence of that call, the Hancock report was handed down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it was not handed down to the Whitlam government because by the time it was completed and presented to the parliament the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the then Treasurer.

That is all we have from the coalition about retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the editorial comment of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>.

We have no record of the achievements of the other side in this place, but we do have a record of achievement&mdash;or should we say non-achievement&mdash;of the same party that was formerly the New South Wales government. That was a government that refused to participate in the national child-care agreement and that robbed the parents of New South Wales of in excess of 4,000 child-care places. I am very pleased to say that that matter has been rectified by the Carr government. It means that those places that are very important for young families of today, where many are two-income families, will be made available to the families of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been major improvements to the superannuation scheme and I have already mentioned John Howard's attitude to a national superannuation scheme. There is funding for vocational education and training for an extra 5,850 university places. This government is very proud of the fact that today there are probably 600,000 university students. Every one of them is federally funded and none are compelled to pay an up-front fee for an undergraduate degree&mdash;they repay by HECS later on when they start earning&mdash;and we are very proud of that. Even if those students go on and do a postgraduate degree, 85 per cent of those courses are still federally funded. Students can still pay by the HECS program, when they are earning. Their parents do not have to front up with the money to allow them to attend university. That is giving the children of the ordinary Aussie battler's family the opportunity to get a university education. I can tell you that in my generation, under a coalition government, that was not the case. It was the children of the Whitlam era who were the first to experience that. This government proudly supports that tradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a comprehensive policy in this budget for indigenous health. There is increased funding for the national childhood immunisation program. Unfortunately, people believe that some of the diseases that were quite prevalent in postwar Australia have gone; they have not. Those diseases are still out there, but some parents are neglecting to have their  children immunised. This budget also includes measures to reduce youth suicide. These are the positive things that this government is doing. These are the things that indicate our care for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to talk about the confidence in our economy and there are many indices of confidence. Let us look at interest rates. It is a shame that the shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), is not here, because last year it was fairly common for him to get up and ask a question about interest rates. As a matter of fact, since the beginning of the last year, he has asked a question on interest rates at question time no less than 29 times&mdash;I am not sure how many MPIs he has moved on it&mdash;but there was not a peep from him yesterday when Westpac dropped its one- to three-year fixed interest home loan rate by .55 per cent. That was the second time since this budget was implemented that banks have indicated that they are prepared to support Australian families. They are supporting the budget strategy because they know the stability that this budget has introduced into the Australian economy. The housing industry will be buoyed by this tendency in interest rates. It will mean that the people who are employed in that very responsible industry will be assured that the strength of that industry will be ongoing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the supports that we give families. I refer again to the article by Tom Dusevic in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>

<PARA>There is no doubt that this is a good budget. With a budget like this, you can keep talking about the good news. We have heard that the opposition has suddenly discovered the Aussie battlers. I would probably put pensioners in that category&mdash;a generation of people who were neglected by the 23 years of coalition government. They certainly did not have a superannuation policy to ensure their secure retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is accepting the responsibility of looking after pensioners. As a matter of fact, I can assure everyone I have no complaint about pensioners. After all, why would I? A married couple of pensionable age today can earn up to $32,000 per annum. Apart from their home, they can have assets up to $347,000 if they are home owners, or up to $429,000 if they are non-home owners, and still qualify for a part pension. The lower their income, the lower their assets, the greater the amount of pension they get. But the important thing is that they do qualify for the fringe benefits, and fringe benefits, as honourable members opposite would know, probably compute to about $1,500 per person per year. Of course, the assistance to single pensioners is comparable. </PARA>

It leaves Brisbane this afternoon and it comes through my electorate tomorrow morning at 6.18. I will get on the train and travel to Newcastle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very concerned about the impact of this budget on the constituencies for which I have particular responsibility, and those are the small business community of Australia and the women of Australia. It is interesting to listen to the voice of the member for Paterson (Mr Horne) getting higher and higher as he tries to defend the indefensible, and that is what this budget is. Before I get into the main text of what I want to say today, I want to answer one or two of those comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of this government's budget this year, the superannuation scheme, is probably one of the greatest deceptions ever perpetrated on the Australian public and it is nothing more than a revenue raising exercise. Believe me, for every single dollar that employers, or employees, put into a superannuation fund, the government immediately takes out 15 per cent. It is a great revenue raising monster and it is not delivering to the people of Australia a superannuation fund that will deliver to them security and equity in their retiring years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every week in my electorate I have people coming into my office expressing their deep concern about the operation of superannuation. It is not the principle that we are concerned about here; it is the way in which this government is operating that fund. I suppose the thinking behind it is, first, to get as much tax in as quickly as possible to try to repair some of the damage that has been done to this country's budget and this country's economy, and, secondly, to protect its mates in the union. That is what the superannuation scheme that this government is offering up is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care is an interesting area. We have been told that the government has a commitment to increase the facilities for child care. Yet in this budget it has taken in excess of $300,000 out of the budget for child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the guardians allowance is concerned&mdash;and I am still addressing the issues raised by the member for Paterson&mdash;guardians were given an extra $2 a week in this budget and an extra $2.50 a week for rent assistance. But when this budget is analysed in depth it turns out to be the old pea-and-thimble trick: they have been given the princely sum of $5.50 a week extra, but it is has been taken away in the child-care facilities&mdash;and I will get on to that in a bit more detail later. These are the very people who need to access child care, but they are going to be paying more for child care. So the $5.50 they have been given on one side of the ledger is taken away on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Paterson also talked about the improved sales of established homes. That is something I do have considerable knowledge of, having giving 20 years of my life to it before I came into this place. It is all right to skite about improved residential sales in the established market, but what this country needs is growth and development. It is the new housing sector that, to a large extent, drives at least part of this economy and that is where the jobs will be lost. It is easy enough to roll over established homes, but what happens to our tradesmen and tradeswomen? What happens to our support industries, such as the carpet suppliers, the drapes and internal fittings suppliers, and all the other people who rely so heavily on the new housing industry to keep going? And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget is the government's 13th attempt to get it right. It is the 13th time that they have failed the people of Australia. It represents yet another comprehensive failure, and I endorse the remarks of my colleague the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) when he said, `This is the unlucky 13th for the government, because it will be the last budget the Keating government will have the benefit of handing down.' That is one good thing. The Australian electorate and the members on this side of the house know that this is the final budget of the Keating Labor government. There will be no further opportunities for the electorate to be deceived by the smoke and mirror tricks that have been a feature of this budget and others delivered by the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget has, for all time, put paid to the government's rhetoric that Australians live in a low tax country. Based on estimates for 1995-96, individual income tax revenue has increased by 153 per cent since 1983; company tax revenue has increased by 276 per cent since 1983; sales tax revenue has increased by 240 per cent since 1983; and revenue from the fringe benefits tax has increased by 431 per cent since its inception in 1986. The total tax revenue will have increased by 165 per cent over that period of time. Perpetuating the myth of low taxes is just another illustration of this government's thinking that they can pull the wool over the Australian electorate's eyes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also taken the lazy, easy way out&mdash;that is, to lump more taxes onto the business sector. There is no commitment to reduce the horrendous waste of human and financial resources applied to conforming with taxation regulation. Millions of dollars will continue to be wasted satisfying the thirst of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for big government and imperial extravagances. This budget has targeted the productive and dynamic small business sector to be the 1995-96 budget milch cow. More than any other sector of the economy, small business will carry the can for the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has implemented a range of initiatives that will lead to reduced employment, investment and business growth. The Prime Minister has already revealed exactly how in touch he is with business reality when, on 11 May, he leered sarcastically at small business saying, `This is as good as it gets,' and, `If you cannot make it in this climate, then get out and get yourself a PAYE job.' This was the Prime Minister's budget marketing message to small business. It was his response to the dismay being expressed by small business owners around Australia that, again, their hopes and aspirations had been dashed by yet another horror budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget has imposed on small business the crippling burden of a new 12 per cent sales tax on the family home, an increase of five per cent in the rate of tax on non-luxury motor vehicles, and an increase in the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. What the government has not done is to remove the burden on business created by its decision to introduce quarterly instalments of tax liability. This arrangement seriously interferes with the cash flow of many businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other crippling burdens which the budget has imposed include an increase in the FBT rate, which is due to the increased Medicare levy, and an increase in the national corporate regulation scheme fees. The government has not provided any change to the level of the provisional tax uplift factor, which also seriously impacts on small business cash flows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party has broken the promises it made to the electorate in 1993 that there would be no new taxes. This year's budget is electoral fraud on a massive scale. Worse still, it has been perpetrated in an environment where the small business sector has borne the brunt of the budget's nasties and is experiencing an alarming downturn in activity and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent to which this government is out of touch with the community was revealed on 30 May this year by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Index</EMPHASIS> report on small business. It revealed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the three months to April `95, sales, growth, employment, profits and investment have plummeted. Australian small businesses reported their worst quarter since 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>But it gets much worse, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Index </EMPHASIS>goes on to reveal that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sharp drop was in line with expectations signalled in the February, 1995 survey and continues the significant decline in small business growth since mid 1994. Expectations for the current three months to July are flat.</PARA>
<PARA>The May <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Index</EMPHASIS> confirms that for small business it has been a case of five minutes of economic sunlight only. What will rub salt into the wound for small businesses is the fact that if the government was in touch with what was going on in the business community during the budget's drafting then its budget strategies are a deliberate and premeditated attack on the small business community. If, as most in the community accept, this government comprises a tired, arrogant and out-of-touch cabal, the budget was framed during a period when the small business sector was declining markedly in activity, and the government had no idea. It was not listening to the concerns which were constantly being expressed by these groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the small business community, the prime ministerial odds were simple: heads I win, tales they lose. My electorate of Pearce is typical of many around this country. In my electorate there are approximately 450,000 small businesses conducting all manner of business enterprises. They are now wondering what their prospects are for the future, and for the year ahead in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the building industry are confronted by the government's new tax of 12 per cent on essential components used in building the family home. This will drive up the price of new homes by at least $1,000, increase the cost of extensions and renovations and further reduce activity in an already severely depressed industry. The government is obviously oblivious to the fact that the number of dwellings financed during the 12 months ending March 1995 has declined by 32.1 per cent, while building approvals for the 12-month period ending April 1995 declined by 24.3 per cent. What sort of masochist would impose a new tax on an industry exhibiting that degree of decline?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Motor vehicle dealers in my electorate are confronted with a similar scenario. Their sales are being impacted upon by hesitant consumer demand and by the government's changes to FBT. The motor vehicle industry has already absorbed the lost revenue caused by the government's changes to FBT on work related expenses. The industry also has to finance cost increases due to interest rate rises. The flow-on effects of the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the yen are also having a very significant impact on this sector of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has now reversed his previous shallow action to reduce sales tax as a political ploy to match the coalition's goods and services tax proposals prior to the 1993 election. The Prime Minister needs reminding that nobody in the small business community is buying his rhetoric that the sales tax on non-luxury motor vehicles was reduced to stimulate consumer demand and now that sales activity has reacted to that stimuli he can turn off the tap. Why would he contemplate such a move when the motor vehicle industry is under major external market pressures? The Prime Minister's chart of the market action must be upside down. Again, only an out-of-touch government would countenance such an action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list of budget imposts that will deliver reduced profits, higher costs, lower employment and lower investment growth extends to almost all industry sections. That is bad news for most Australians because it means more job losses, more loss of opportunity and more poverty for the very people that need the assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For small businesses in my electorate and around Australia, it is a case that if company tax increases do not get you then the sales tax will. If the additional compliance costs associated with changes to the PAYE remittance arrangements and the new sales tax regime do not increase your costs, the increased national corporate regulation fees will. And on it goes. For every small benefit that has been touted in this budget, there is a corresponding negative. As I said, it is the old pea and thimble trick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I turned the pages of the various budget documents, the depth of the deception of the Australian community became more and more obvious. Equally clear was the fact that the government has again failed to deliver on essential micro-economic reform. That is now in the too-hard basket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no hiding the fact that the chickens have come home to roost for this government. The excesses of the past 13 years are now starkly revealed for all to see. Its high taxing, big spending habits, when combined with a pandering to special interest groups, have left the government floundering for opportunities to deliver the type of budget statement required to ensure that the pain of `the recession we had to have' was not had in vain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken the easy option, the high taxing, low cost-cutting option that will result in its demise at the next election. The most unfortunate aspect to the mismanagement of this government is that so many people who were dedicated to capitalising on the opportunities available to them and to their families will be made to suffer the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only in the area of small business that this budget fails. It also fails women and it fails women's families. Tax increases are a major feature of the budget, and that will impact on many women and on their families. Additional costs on health, housing and motor vehicles will place added burdens on families and on women, who in most cases have the responsibility of balancing the family budget.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of initiatives that appear to offer benefits to women. But a closer examination of them reveals that they will either deliver little or they are delayed, like the cervical cancer program, where $11 million is set aside but it is not delivered until the year 1999-2000. That is the kind of trick that this government has got up to; the kind of deception of the Australian people, and women in particular. Initiatives such as in Aboriginal health, which is a clear area of Labor government's failure; child care, where funds have been reduced by $325 million; and superannuation and access to justice are just some of the examples where the government programs deliver questionable outcomes. For most of the gains women will find there is a corresponding loss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically with respect to women, other measures will have an impact on them, such as the additional cost for the development of the family home. As I mentioned, the increases given to guardians and given to sole parents for assistance with private rent payments are more than absorbed in additional costs to access child care. Those are the very people in our community who need and rely on child-care services, because they are usually the sole breadwinner as well as the sole provider for the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see a 5.6 per cent drop in funding for the Office of the Status of Women. Women form more than half of our community and that office is already funded with a very small amount&mdash;I would say a pittance&mdash;yet the government has seen fit to reduce the funding to the Office of the Status of Women by nearly six per cent. And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contempt that the Prime Minister displays for Australians is illustrated by his attempt to sneak through a number of budget issues which in isolation may appear relatively innocuous but when viewed in the broader context are simply further examples of deceit and deception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures, which have been carefully targeted at those individuals with the least capacity to resist or avoid their impact, have been prioritised to ensure that it is ordinary Australians who suffer the most at the hands of this government and its budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each one of the initiatives that I have outlined should be benchmarked against the level of funding provided in the budget last year, and again this year, to fund the Australian Trade Union Training Authority. In 1994, the Australian Trade Union Training Authority received $10 million: in fact, it was $10.1 million. The idea of handing this over was to ensure the development and national coordination of the delivery of comprehensive, high quality training and education, to assist trade unions to meet the organisational, political, economic and social challenges of the coming decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hypocrisy of this government is exposed when funds for its union mates are afforded a higher priority than funding for women's preventative medical programs or funding for domestic violence programs, or the cost of heating, hot water and electric lights for many elderly&mdash;and many other&mdash;Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business can be sure that it will receive no support from this government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition will continue to support small business in its endeavours, and the coalition will also work tirelessly to expose the fraud and deception that is a key mark of this budget. Australian women and their families will also be comforted by the knowledge that the coalition will ensure that, in future, priorities will be established that will ensure that the health and safety of themselves and their families is afforded a higher priority than Labor's pandering to its union mates and to minority groups within the community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that we perhaps overlook is the fact that there is potential in having the government involved in certain aspects of the economy to, perhaps, ensure that the introduction of new technologies is properly directed and that new technologies are used for the public benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my concerns at the moment is that, as we see the burgeoning increase in such areas as electronic transfers, Internet and all these things which, a couple of decades ago, were not even in people's imagination, the fact is that overwhelmingly&mdash;not only in Australia, but also internationally and globally&mdash;these facilities are in the hands of private ownership and are, therefore, directed by a very few, and not necessarily for the public good but rather for private benefit. That is of concern. It is perhaps because we have not been able to adapt current public policy to be able to ensure that we can handle the way in which some of these new technologies that will have an impact on everybody's life are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past few weeks, I have had discussions with colleagues about the impact that something like Internet will have on the work of members of parliament. Some of them have tried to indicate to me that they will avoid having to know anything about it. But even some of my older colleagues will no doubt have to be involved in Internet, whether it is through their work in this place or in later life, in their retirement. One of my colleagues tried to avoid it by saying that he could not imagine it would affect him when he was fishing on the banks of the local river, but I am sure that in some way it will even touch upon the fishermen and anglers of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the power which the people who control this technology can have over people's lives that is of concern to me. Whilst we will put in a raft of regulations and legislation to ensure that there is a framework in which these technologies should be used for the wider good, I do not believe that we can, in fact, necessarily guarantee any such thing, since it is likely to be one of those areas where there will be all sorts of devices to get around that type of control. Whether it be as a legitimate competitor or not, government owned enterprise could have an influence over the direction of the development of technologies and, importantly, over the development of information technologies, where there will be a change in emphasis in the way that the public gets access to information. </PARA>

Such people of imagination could see that having those enterprises controlled by government gave direction to the way that they could influence the development of this nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) at the table. He was kind enough to come to my electorate earlier this year to discuss with a number of community groups and labour market program brokers the potential that confronted us to put together packages under a wide range of programs to address the problem of unemployment. That was a very successful gathering. It led to other workshops where proposals have been worked up, and a number are off and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presented certificates a couple of weeks ago at a LEAP project which had the benefit not only of giving training to some 10 or 12 young Australians but also of addressing an environmental problem in the local area by improving the local community amenity. It is these types of projects and the training aspects of them that are very important. They need to be supported; they need to be continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we see headlines like we saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> after the budget which emphasised `Working Nation cut by $1.2bn', we have to understand why that has occurred; why a statement is made that the Working Nation package is to be slashed by more than $1.2 billion in the next four years. There is a fundamental reason. The major plank of Working Nation was that we undertook to do certain things: to enter into a job compact with categories of unemployed people, and to provide them with certain services and programs. In fact, we are ahead of the targets that were set in Working Nation. So that headline reflects the success that we have had, that the things that we put in place are working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that needs to be emphasised is that, in an article with that type of headline, we have to wait until the second last paragraph until it acknowledges that there will be continuing increases in funding&mdash;below the levels that were announced in Working Nation, but increasing. So, in this financial year that we will complete at the end of this month, some $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion will have been spent on labour market programs post Working Nation. Next financial year it will be $2.2 billion, and the year after, $2.3 billion. Let us not take the fact underlying that headline as being any reversal in the commitment that this government has to those that Working Nation targeted.

<PARA>The government should not rest on its laurels on this. We need to continue that trend downwards. We have to also understand that the underlying thread of this budget is about continuing that type of recovery and also looking at addressing long-term problems, looking to the future to ensure that many of the measures that we put in place now are addressing problems over the long haul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the major features of the budget include additional funding for the environment of $217 million over four years. The main proposal is the coastal policy package, at $55 million. There is also $55 million allocated over four years to accelerate the national forest policy statement&mdash;a very important consideration because we have to avoid the problems we saw late last year and early this year in getting a proper forest policy into place. We had the agreement of all the states, except Tasmania, but, because we had not put our efforts behind the agreements and provided the resources, we were not getting the benefit from those agreements. It is important that those types of measures are included in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of health, we have modest proposals like the national child immunisation program, costing $25 million over two years, to raise immunisation rates among children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Thursday before last we had the announcement of the Justice Statement, which was foreshadowed in the budget. It involves additional expenditure of $158 million over four years. Let us look at the way that that Justice Statement was developed. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), along with their colleagues the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), soon after the last election put in place a process to put this statement together. It took a great deal of work. It is not something that can happen overnight. It has taken the two and a bit years since the election to put it in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It showed a commitment to trying to address the problems in the Australian justice system, problems that needed to be addressed not just for the 1990s but right through for the future. I applaud the efforts and the commitment that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made to ensuring that that Justice Statement got up and running. Remember that there is an additional $158 million contained in this budget. That is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go to other areas in the budget such as regional policy. There is an additional $254 million for the better cities program. For my electorate, the better cities program has been a most important program. The only involvement in my electorate is in the northern end of the Plenty Road corridor where there is to be an extension of the light rail to Mill Park and the Bundoora campus of RMIT and the proposed development of excess institutional land at Janefield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the announcement of the better cities program, there has been continuing work and planning on the Janefield proposal. The light rail extension is nearing completion. The importance of the light rail extension is that it gives a valuable extension to the public transport network of Melbourne, not only to the urban fringe of Melbourne but to a campus of a respected tertiary institution. The Janefield land is alongside the new terminus of the light rail and alongside the eastern and western Bundoora campuses of RMIT. The development of that land gave an opportunity for the local stakeholders to sit down and be involved in the planning. Through the efforts of the Whittlesea Family Resource Centre, which is a federally funded body, we have been able to get together agencies that will be providing services to the local area, the people from the relevant state departments and the people from the better cities unit to start having those discussions that will see appropriate planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That new residential development has not only the potential for proper environmental technology to be put in place, which will mean this is a subdivision that more closely represents principles of ecological sustainability, but also the potential to ensure at the planning stage important resources such as child care; student housing, as it is alongside an institution; and other things that might be involved in employment creation. At the moment we are conducting a successful series of seminars and workshops to develop under the banner of Better Cities some solutions to these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though all this is occurring we still have from those opposite a cry that we have to slash outlays. This morning the Business Council of Australia said yet again that we have to slash outlays. At the same time that those things are being said, those opposite say the level of taxation is too high. But, as my colleagues on this side of the chamber repeatedly indicate, the fact is that Australia continues to be a low taxing nation. That is important. Nobody on the opposite side has come up with any supporting data for the alternative. We have to understand those things are important to the people of Australia. </PARA>

I inform him that between now and the next election I will be jumping up and down and fulminating&mdash;I might baulk at frothing at the mouth&mdash;to ensure the Australian public is properly exposed to the types of policies that those opposite might put to us at the election.

Professor Richard Blandy, in a landmark article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> some time ago, gave the figures: this time next century, in the year 2095, there will be six million Australians only.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the answer lies in helping genuine families in Australia and giving them a fair go. Income splitting, raising the threshold or some other attack should be made to relieve the enormous growth in the tax burden upon this particular part of the Australian community. The Parliamentary Library recently put out a publication which indicated that a single income family of a husband, wife and two children paid 38 per cent in tax, which was the amount of tax paid by a single person. That same family will now pay 67 per cent, nearly as much tax as is paid by two single people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that every speaker on the ALP side has given almost identical speeches. I wish some of them would listen to some of their colleagues so that we would not have to listen to the same speech over and over. It strikes me that Labor members get writing instructions from their caucus and then they all race off like a mob of lemmings and give exactly the same speech. Every one of them has said how marvellous this budget is and how wonderful the economy is going. Their illustrious leader, Placido Domingo, in fact stood in this place and said, `This is as good as it gets.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us see just how good it is when it gets as good as it gets. This country enjoys not only a negative birth rate&mdash;Australians are deciding it is better not to have kids; and that has to be a sad reflection upon the nation&mdash;but also the highest juvenile suicide rate on the entire planet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bankruptcies for the employer class, the business class, are whipping along at about 15,000 a year&mdash;last year there were 14,179 and the year before that there were over 16,000. To put that in perspective, the year the socialists won government in Australia, there were 4,575 bankruptcies. In 1973, the year when John McEwen, whose era was much maligned era, left the stage, we had 2,274 bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this place on many occasions, I have lived very close to people whose lives have been shattered and destroyed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bankruptcies represent those who declare technical bankruptcy. I know of only two people who have taken technical bankruptcy, yet I would know of hundreds, maybe even thousands if I try really hard, of people who have gone broke. They have walked out of their shop; they have walked off their farm. They have not gone out and been able to go on the dole, take that money and spend it to buy food and clothing for their families; they have walked out with a debt upon their shoulders of $50,000, $100,000 or even $200,000 that they will carry for the rest of their days. The bank has not bothered to foreclose because it has had nothing to foreclose on&mdash;it has taken everything off them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish&mdash;and I do not have time&mdash;to go into the reasons why the government has, on many occasions previously, come into this place and given the reasons that we are in the situation we are in. Any sane person who felt that he could go into interest rates in excess of 15 per cent and 16 per cent and not wipe out the business and enterprise classes of Australia would have had rocks in his head; alternatively, he simply did not care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those people sitting opposite must bear upon their consciences what has happened and what is happening today in this country. The employer class, the enterprise class, the small business class&mdash;I am not talking about big business; all it does is work for somebody else; it does not take any risks&mdash;has been torn to pieces. Economists say that there are 20 people going broke for every one that declares technical bankruptcy, but let us just work on a figure of 10. Nearly one million Australian families have lost everything in the last five years. Over 800,000&mdash;even if you use the figure of only 10 people going broke for every one person that declares technical bankruptcy&mdash;business families in Australia have been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last quarter the bankruptcy figures were higher than the quarter before and were higher than the similar quarter last year. So bankruptcies are on the rise. They are not on the decline; they are on the rise. That is what is happening to the business class&mdash;the boys who have gone out there into the hard, cold world and had a go. Many of the people who have not yet done that intend to&mdash;the employee class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between the June quarter in 1984&mdash;I am not blaming this government for what took place before 1984; I think 1983 really belonged to the last government&mdash;and the June quarter in 1994 the CPI figures rose 70 per cent. Average weekly earnings between the June quarter in 1984 and the June quarter in 1994 rose 62.9 per cent. So the average employee in Australia was 7.1 per cent worse off. That might not seem like a really big figure&mdash;I will say a few words about this later&mdash;but this government makes everything look good by borrowing huge amounts of money and then dumping them into the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 3 1/2 years the government has effectively borrowed $60,000 million and dumped it into the Australian economy. Retail sales have gone up; motor car sales have gone up; and unemployment has come down. Everything is looking good, with the exception of the current account deficit, demonstrating that with every day that passes the country gets poorer and poorer, and with the exception of the burgeoning interest rate debt that we are leaving future Australians. Our average interest payable has grown dramatically from under $4,000 million two years ago to over $9,000 million, as projected in this year's budget. I leave it to the imagination of people in this place as to what will happen if the debt keeps burgeoning at that rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to taxation. Taxation has to be increased to compensate for the fact that the government is borrowing all this money. The interest payable by the federal government has leapt from about $3,500 million to nearly $9,500 million. As someone has to pay for it, we have put interest rates up. As we have to bring the unemployment figures down, we have created all sorts of artificial mechanisms. In fact, the government has a veritable plethora of artificial mechanisms that are designed to reduce the unemployment levels. Some of them are socially acceptable and some of them are socially deplorable. They have had the effect of lowering the unemployment rate, but they have cost money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation in Australia has increased from $52,000 million a year in 1983 to $151,000 million a year in this year's budget. That is an increase in taxation of 290.4 per cent. This is against a rise in the CPI of around 70 to 80 per cent in the same period. So there has been a massive increase in taxation of the Australian people. A lot of it is hidden away. Telecom is suddenly being taxed. All of the government instrumentalities are being taxed. One has to look at Hilmer and say, `Is this simply a clever device so that even more enterprises throughout Australia can be taxed to the hilt in the same way as we suddenly started taxing Telecom?' I wonder whether we can figure out a way to tax the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That increase in taxation has taken out of the pockets of the average Australian 15.8 per cent of his disposable income. Unless he is on the social wage&mdash;a person who is earning a wage is not by definition in receipt of the social wage unless he is on an extraordinarily low income; that is, in the bottom five per cent&mdash;the wage earner in Australia has lost 15.8 per cent of his disposable income in the life of this ALP government. He has lost 7.1 per cent of his purchasing power because the CPI has run just a little bit ahead of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have time to read articles from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> demonstrating that the number of poor people in Australia who are in the lower wage brackets has burgeoned and exploded whilst the number of people who are rich has got smaller and those who are rich have got incredibly wealthier. I do not have time to take that into account. Those two figures add up to a decline in disposable income of 22.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my friends who are just ordinary Australians say to me, `I can't afford to buy a new car.' I say to them, `Of course you can't. You're nearly 25 per cent worse off now than you were 10 years ago.' That is if you are lucky enough to have a job. But there are nearly a million Australians who are not lucky enough to have a job. If we exclude the last two years of the Malcolm Fraser era when we had a great drought&mdash;and I think we can say that drought was the worst one in Australian history, not the present one&mdash;only 7 1/2 per cent of the Australian work force were unemployed during the coalition's time in government. In the much maligned days when John McEwen retired from the scene, this country's unemployment rate was 1.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have an unemployment figure of 8 1/2 per cent, and the government skites about this. The book co-written by Mr Quiggan and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), a man of considerable courage and integrity, says that when the official unemployment figures show unemployment is 10 1/2 per cent, in actual fact the real figure will be 16 1/2 per cent. Now that unemployment is down to 8 1/2 per cent, I think our real unemployment figure is 14 1/2 per cent. They are not my words; they are the words of a Labor member of parliament. The government has this incredible definition that, if a person works for one hour, he or she is regarded as being employed, not unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employees have lost 22.9 per cent of their disposable income since the Labor government has been in power. At least three-quarters of the hapless people who do not have a job can thank the socialists for their position, because they would have had a job if the situation before the Labor government came to power prevailed. Employers can look forward to bankruptcy&mdash;one in three businesses in Australia will go bankrupt&mdash;and the utter destruction of everything they have worked for in their entire life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The root cause of all this is the fact that this country's economy is not growing, although it is growing in an artificial sense&mdash;as Mr Keynes so wonderfully put it. In a depression, it is good to pay one group of people to dig a hole and another group or people to fill that hole in. That is what this government has done. It has not dug a hole that will contain water which we can use to irrigate and make the Australian economic cake bigger. It has not done that. That would be a bit too clever for a socialist to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The root cause of the problem comes from the fact that the real economic cake is not performing. We have the artificial economic cake which was created by borrowing $60,000 million over 3 1/2 years and then dumping it into the economy. It was also created by taxing people huge amounts of money and then using it to create artificially inflated retail prices&mdash;using the blunt instrument of interest rates to smash down the growth of imports. I do not know how the government expects to do anything else except increase our imports, because most of Australian industry has been closed down while the Labor government has been in power. There have been 500,000 employees lost from the textile, clothing and footwear industries alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers lie with the Australian dollar. Everything that I have ever read in my entire life says that, when a country has a dreadful balance of payments problem, it should lower its dollar or prevent imports from coming into the country. When Japan had a problem with oil prices some years ago, it crudely stopped imports. Beef was one of those imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be a bit more sophisticated than that. We need to simply do something about the value of the Australian dollar. When the Australian dollar was allowed to free float in 1986, it dropped to 59c. We owed only $70,000 million then. We now owe close to $200,000 million. Things would be different if the dollar were allowed to free float instead of being propped up through buying from the Reserve Bank and artificially high interest rates. The last time I looked in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Far Eastern Economic Review</EMPHASIS>, which is the best journal to look at, Australian interest rates for businesses were 10.5 per cent, United States rates were six per cent and Japan's rates varied, with the average being 3.6 per cent. So our trading partners are on six per cent and 3.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take 6.3 per cent as being a reasonable figure for interest rates. We are almost twice that figure. If interest rates are brought down, obviously the value of the dollar will come down. This would mean that it would be enormously expensive for Australians to buy imported items and they would be forced to buy Australian products, which would stimulate growth in industry in Australia. I am not asking for tariffs to be imposed. I am not asking for Australia to have the protective walls that every other country in the world enjoys at the moment because the GATT arrangements have not been introduced. When the protection that exists already is tariffied then those countries will be in a happy position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many community projects need fast tracking&mdash;ethanol, Weipa, Century Zinc, Shelbourne Bay, the Duchess phosphate deposit and the cattle industry. I will not go into how and why. Some $750,000 million worth of projects has been held up. I praise the Prime Minister for his brief period of enlightenment which lasted about four months&mdash;enough for us to get the Macarthur River project on stream. That project is taking place at one of the bigger mines in Australia. We will never know why, when this was the first time he ever did anything right, he stopped it four months later. Presumably he was scared of the Greens or the Aboriginal industry&mdash;I emphasise that I do not mean people of Aboriginal descent with whom I am friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous water schemes&mdash;the Bradfield scheme, the Kimberley Pipeline, the Daly and Clarence Rivers diversions&mdash;which will bring in $5,300 million each year into the Australian economy. Some people have said that they do not work, but that has been said about the Ord River project. That project cost $64 million and it is projected that, over the next two years, it will bring in $75 million every year&mdash;for the cost of a lousy $64 million which, even in today's terms, would be no more than $70 million. So the Ord River project will pay for itself every year. That has been the great argument as to why we should not continue with these sorts of schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Snowy Mountains project cost $4,000 million, but it brings in $2,300 million a year. The Fairbairn Dam project in Queensland was opposed by almost everybody in this place but the government brutally pushed it through&mdash;God bless it. That project cost $39 million and it brings in $65 million by way of cotton production and the sale of water to mines in the surrounding areas. If we took an aggressive marketing policy on wool we would earn an extra $2,500 million in the economy.

If these are evidenced in my electorate, surely they are replicated in every other electorate in Australia. This is not just a load of parliamentary rhetoric; it is really happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was privileged this week to launch a new employment project in Tasmania, whose goal is to find jobs for 650 Tasmanians. That is a huge number considering our small population base. The Beacon employment challenge, part of the Beacon Foundation, has won the largest case management contract for a non-government employment agency in Tasmania. It has won the tender to find work for 650 Tasmanians, which includes 350 young people. The organisation has the support of major employers and industry groups. Through individualised case management and widespread support throughout the community, that organisation and I are totally convinced that the target will be met, which is a positive sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other examples in my electorate of similar things happening&mdash;cooperation between local councils, training centres, state government departments, although they may be Liberal controlled, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other great initiatives in this area worthy of mention, brief though it will be, are: a $16.5 billion allocation for the higher education sector over the next triennium. This will provide an additional 1,950 places in 1996, a further 2,300 in the following year and a further 1,600 in 1998. There will be an allocation of $70 million in funding for Australia's vocational education and training schemes, which is a key factor in providing the link between schools, TAFE colleges and the work force. There is an allocation for a further $23.8 million in 1996 towards the implementation of the Australian vocational training system. Those who know the AVTS will know that it provides a wide range of education and training pathways to those entering the work force and leads to the attainment of nationally recognised competency levels&mdash;something that Mr Clifford is looking forward to.

<PARA>So it is not all doom and gloom. There are positive things. There will also be a $34 million allocation in increased support for quality schooling and national equity programs. How can members opposite stand there and have the gall to say we are ignoring families and that the battlers out there in the Australian community are not getting a fair go when these things, through the Department of Employment, Education and Training, are being set in place, are operating and are successful? As I said, if it is happening in little Tasmania&mdash;`little' compared to the rest of Australia&mdash;and there are positive outlooks and positive things are happening, why is it not happening around the rest of Australia or are we all hiding our light behind a bushel, claiming doom and gloom and contemplating our navel?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second portfolio I would like to concentrate on briefly today is the human services and health portfolio. Probably this department more than the Department of Employment, Education and Training has a series of budget allocations which will look after families. Total expenditure in this department will rise from $18.4 billion to $19.6 billion. What will this increase result in for our so-called battlers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important program is the $18 million three-year program dedicated to finding new ways to reduce preventable disease and death, especially from tobacco. There is $24 million for a national childhood immunisation program and a $42 million national cervical screening program for women. Funding of $13 million is allocated specifically to redress the growing problem of youth suicide. There is a $4 million program involving research and education on hepatitis C. There is a huge increase of $58 million in funding to the National Health and Medical Research Council for research into breast and prostate cancer, mental health and Aboriginal health. There is an additional $56 million to improve the quality of nursing homes and hostels and to strengthen support for carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet there is this cry from the opposition that we are neglecting the battlers, that we are short-changing families. How can the opposition say that in all honesty? How can it cast this doom and gloom when these positive things are being set in train? Families must benefit and will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the justice portfolio we see further evidence of what this government sees as its priority&mdash;assisting all families, not just the battlers. There is a statement in the justice document which says that families are a fundamental national resource; they are the lifeblood and the future of our nation. Here I would agree with the member for Kennedy. Flowing from the Justice Statement and the budget measures are numerous examples of initiatives that will assist families in a whole lot of legal and paralegal areas to deal with difficulties and disputes that might arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just papering over the cracks; these are constructive initiatives. I would like to mention some of them. There is the doubling of the availability of relationship preparation courses to equip couples to identify problems before they become legal matters and thereby incur enormous costs not just to litigants but also to society in general and to the children of these families. There is additional funding to expand adolescent mediation and family therapy services in rural and regional areas&mdash;an area that is being neglected at the moment&mdash;and to assist more young people to resolve their problems with their families rather than leave home and take up the youth homeless allowance. These must be positive measures. There is no mention of them by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a funding proposal to provide additional funding to expand financial counselling services, enabling more people to have access to advice to help them with financial difficulties. In my electorate, which has a large broadacre public housing component, this will certainly benefit a huge number of people who are struggling to manage their finances. There is also funding to enable the expansion of family court counselling services by establishing and upgrading housing registries in regional areas of Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of women's justice there is another group of initiatives. There is $12.3 million to establish a national network of women's legal centres to provide assistance to women in city and country areas with legal problems. There is funding to provide national access to toll-free telephone legal advice through these centres. There is the allocation of $2.4 million through the family support service to address violence in family relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of legal aid, a key aspect for me as a member is the fact that $13.9 million will be allocated to the Commonwealth community legal centre program to increase the number of generalist and specialist community legal services. I am lucky enough to have one of these next to my electorate office out in Bridgewater. These centres are doing a magnificent job out there in the community. If those opposite have not seen the benefit in their electorates I would advise them to go out and knock on the door and find out what they are doing. They are doing a magnificent job. Part of the justice portfolio is the government's Safe Australia strategy, which seeks for the first time to implement a national approach to crime to encompass all aspects of society: the government, business, the media, police, community groups and concerned citizens. The goal is to achieve a safer community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this 1995-96 budget the government has proposed a whole range of initiatives in these three portfolios areas which I have briefly addressed today. In my humble opinion, there is no doubt that the Labor government is firmly committed to ensuring that all families&mdash;irrespective of whether they live in Bellerive, Port Augusta, Rainbow or Bankstown&mdash;are catered for in all portfolio areas by a caring government. We are an inclusive government, not an exclusive one. </PARA>

Why was he so keen to see small business people, using their entrepreneurial skills for their own benefit and the benefit then of the nation, become employees instead? I will tell you why. It is because he gets the tax money quicker. </PARA>

That did not happen because we have had a sudden growth in the number of employees. It just has not happened. It is a direct expression of the success of the tax office's bludgeoning of small business at the behest of the government. That is how those extra collections will be received.

In other words, there was a moral right that they should charge 21 per cent tax because that is what you used to pay. But that is the way of collectivist socialist governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When nominal savings were taxed, there was no way that people were going to save&mdash;to be taxed on a higher level of inflation so that their real interest rate was taxed away in that environment. As a consequence, we have seen household savings fall. I do not think the Leader of the Opposition should take too much notice of one quarter. There is only one way that we are going to add to savings, and that is of course by doing something on a long-term basis&mdash;for instance, through superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The policies which the government has put into the budget will have a truly profound impact on savings, and you can see this in respect of superannuation. By 2002 every person in the community will have had put away on their behalf 15 per cent of their income. At the moment it is five per cent. It is five per cent in 1995; it will be 15 per cent by the year 2002, only seven years away. This is going to make a very great difference in being able to make such a change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just remind the Leader of the Opposition that, in 1976, the Hancock committee recommended a national comprehensive superannuation scheme. Three years later we saw his then government's response saying that it was too hard. As Treasurer he issued a press statement saying that the government had decided not to introduce the scheme of national superannuation recommended by a majority of the committee. That is the then Treasurer. Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government believes that the freedom of choice individuals currently enjoy in arranging their own affairs in respect of incomes should be retained.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the freedom to go on the age pension and the freedom for the high income earners to be taxed concessionally on five per cent of their income&mdash;huge tax concessions. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many people already making what they feel are worthwhile investments for retirement, whether in the form of insurance savings or assets, the imposition of a compulsory contribution to a national scheme might not be welcome.</PARA>
<PARA>So there was no idea then about doing something about savings, even though it was clear by then that national savings had started to fall. I also remind the House that, when this government came to office in 1983, there was only 40 per cent coverage of people in superannuation. That today is 90 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the coalition is now saying that it will cap the benefits introduced by the government in the budget. Let me tell you what this means. I have a table here from Treasury which says that, under the new co-contribution scheme introduced by the government, the benefits for employees of small employers at the end of their working life will be $461,000 but, if the SGC is frozen from March 1996, as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, the benefit will be only $143,000. In other words, people on average weekly earnings who work for small employers would be $318,000 worse off at the end of their working lives; in other words, a 68.9 per cent reduction in the benefits coming from the government scheme in the budget. Employees of large employers would get $461,000 under the government scheme and that would reduce to $173,000 if the SGC were frozen, as per the Leader of the Opposition's proposal. So people would lose $288,000 of benefits, a reduction of 62 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is up here saying he believes in more savings. He said, I think on 2UE, `Conceptually, of course, we favour national savings,' but, as always, the Leader of the Opposition has trouble putting concepts into practice, as he had with the floating exchange rate, the deregulation of the financial markets and the cut in tariffs&mdash;all those things. He always believes in them conceptually. But isn't it funny that something happened on the way to the forum? John Hewson had it all in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> a couple of years ago.  He said, `We get into the cabinet room and then some anecdote said by a National Party member in the bar the previous night would knock us over.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer, who will be aware that the household saving ratio is at a record low, a matter about which the Prime Minister is blissfully ignorant. Treasurer, is it true, as stated by the government's own savings adviser Dr FitzGerald, that employees are likely to run down bank savings in order to pay for the government's proposed compulsory superannuation changes, leading to a switching in savings? Do you also agree with Dr FitzGerald's statement that the government should broaden savings incentives to encourage workers to retain investments in banks and shares?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that the national accounts show that there is a reduced level in household savings, that the household saving ratio is down to 2.6 per cent. But I think it is also worth noting what the statistician, after having noted that, had to say. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Caution should be exercised in interpreting this ratio in recent years because major components of household income and expenditure may still be subject to significant revisions. The impact of these revisions on the saving ratio can cause changes in the apparent direction of the trend.</PARA>
<PARA>So, in terms of the household saving ratio, which is a derivative outcome and, therefore, bears the impact of any errors involved in the calculations which lead towards it, we need to be cautious in putting too much weight on such numbers. Nevertheless, there is, undoubtedly, over time, in terms of the figures that we have available, a downward trend in household savings. But as the Prime Minister has been pointing out, what the government is very much about is turning that trend around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions that we have announced in the budget in relation to superannuation are, of course, an enormous step forward in improving household savings in this country, taking the superannuation contribution from the current six per cent by the employer to 15 per cent, including three per cent from the employee and the matching contribution from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Treasurer referred to the fact that there could be some switching from other savings. Of course, that is true. There may well be some switching from other savings and allowance is made for that in our calculations. In the calculations that we have announced about the boost to savings coming from both the superannuation guarantee charge&mdash;that is, the employer contribution&mdash;and from the employee's own contribution and the government's matching contribution, allowance has been made for the fact that there can be a switch of some 30 per cent from other savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That allowance comes out of a study by Treasury as to what is an appropriate amount and that is built into the forecast of what the boost to savings will be overall. That means there is full account taken of the point raised by the shadow Treasurer. The boost to savings of some four per cent of GDP by the year 2020 coming from all of those factors and the two per cent boost to savings by early next century are significant changes in household and national savings and mean that we will be seeing a great improvement to savings performance by the nation coming from the household sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear some stupid chuckling from the front bench opposite, presumably because he thinks four per cent sounds small. If the current household saving ratio is, in fact, 2.64 per cent, four per cent looks like a fairly big addition to me. Of course, that is not the only element of saving. There are other elements of saving that are reducing public sector dissaving, which is being achieved through the return to a budget surplus. Only this side of the House has produced budget surpluses. They were in the four years at the end of the 1980s when the now Prime Minister was Treasurer and we are again returning to a budget surplus for this forthcoming year, 1995-96, and for the years thereafter to 1998-99.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a lot of years of surpluses against none ever from those opposite&mdash;not one surplus ever. In the five years that the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer there was not one surplus. In the whole of the 23 years from 1949 to 1972, there was not one surplus from the coalition government. That return to budget surplus will considerably improve national savings by eliminating public sector dissaving. That is a major boost to national saving; that is very important, indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of saving which is important is corporate saving. With company profits being high, corporate saving is relatively substantial. But it is the public sector dissaving which has been a major factor. That is now being eliminated and the household saving area, which has been scaling down, will be dramatically returned to positive growth by the superannuation measures that we have announced in the budget.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How did he achieve that domestic surplus? He had to resort to something known as asset sales. He raised $181 million from asset sales. In other words, the whole of his domestic surplus was dependent on his selling assets&mdash;that is, they had to be used to get the calculation. If there are any fraudulent devices going on around this place, we know where they are coming from. How can the Leader of the Opposition be so hypocritical as to accuse us of fraudulent device when he himself was quite happy to include asset sales to achieve a miserable domestic surplus once in his five-year period as Treasurer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the now Prime Minister was Treasurer, we had four surpluses by the end of the 1980s. If you look at domestic surpluses, we had five of them but if we were to adopt the Leader of the Opposition's definition of a surplus we could claim an extra one. For this year, if we are going to talk about domestic surpluses being the relevant criterion, the surplus of $700 million becomes a surplus of $3.4 billion. That is our domestic surplus in 1995-96 against $39 million in 1980-81.</PARA>

This is the same party that is arguing for the battlers whom they wanted to put a 15 per cent, completely undercompensated consumption tax, GST, on at the last election. This is the same party that wants to abolish bulkbilling for battlers&mdash;the people on low incomes who need to go to doctors, who cannot afford to cover the 15 per cent residual and who are bulkbilled. The same people want to knock $10,000 million out of Commonwealth government spending, which can only come out of transfer payments to the poor, the low paid, the sick, the elderly or the schools because they have given up, they said, any use of any reference to changes to revenue or receipts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On all of that cynicism let me give these facts: the best measure of average living standards in Australia is real household disposable income. Why is it the best measure? It is because it includes wages, salaries, supplements, pensions and social security benefits, and it includes them on an after tax basis per person. What do we find? Between 1983 to 1995 real household disposable income increased by 40 per cent. Because the population has grown since then, it is more relevant to look to the numbers per head. Disposable income in the last March quarter was $3,568, compared with $3,058 in the March quarter of 1983; that is, it was up 19.8 per cent. That is a 1.7 per cent per head increase every year in disposable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, under the last coalition government real household disposable income per capita increased by only 2.1 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 50-year leases on the airports will not carry with them a right of the lessee to develop the airport without recourse to a set of standards set by this parliament and regulated by the department, with a minister available in this parliament from time to time to account for the manner in which those safeguards and standards are enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the House well knows, I have been very critical of many aspects of airport administration, particularly in respect of Sydney airport, over recent years. I am very pleased to be able to indicate that we have taken a good range of steps to tighten the controls. It is for that reason that we have had that series of announcements since the opening of the third runway&mdash;a third runway which the honourable member,  like me, opposed at the time&mdash;to restrict the operations from it. The first announcement related to the restricted flight paths and was announced by the Prime Minister and me. That stopped planes fanning out all over Sydney and has, I can say, seen planes overwhelmingly fly with laser-like precision down a very narrow flight path. That does not make it any easier for the people under that flight path, but it means there are fewer people in total affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also means that we can concentrate our efforts, which involve the expenditure of $260 million, to deal with noise amelioration for those premises that are so affected.

That means, of course, that aircraft are much higher at the time they get to the residential areas. Again, it is a measure this government has taken to try, to the best extent possible, to protect those people living on those flight paths from the noise nuisance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have banned the use of 737 aircraft during the curfew hours. I know that is something the honourable member would applaud. In addition, we have indicated that all curfew freight arrangements have to be transferred to Badgerys Creek airport when it is eventually developed as a curfew-free airport. We have also allocated in this budget some $762 million for the development of that airport and for the transport links to it. These are all, once again, aimed at alleviating the very grave difficulties that are being experienced by people in the honourable member's constituency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are intent on making sure that we do not have a similar situation occur in the future in western Sydney as we have seen, through a lack of planning, in the inner metropolitan area with the development of the third runway, which all of you sitting opposite supported. It is for that reason that we have a range of environmental studies under way into water, air and noise. A whole new series of contours is being developed using the responsibilities which are, and will remain, those exclusively of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I can give the member for North Sydney one further safeguard. He approached me recently about his own constituency's lack of representation on the newly constituted consultative committee on airport noise, which will have the job of policing the bureaucrats in all of these activities. After he wrote to me, I indicated to him that I would give some consideration to it. That committee will be having its first meeting next Monday under the chairmanship of the Hon.

I am writing to the honourable member today inviting him to nominate a representative in order that his constituency is directly represented in that policing program.

If you go through a traineeship, you have an 88 per cent chance of a positive outcome. If you go through a NEIS program, you have an 84 per cent success rate.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question goes to the issue of coastal management, about which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories made a major statement. I think it is important that this House remember that something like 80 per cent of Australians live on the coastline and that 30 per cent to 40 per cent of recent development has been directly in areas that have a very significant effect on coastal management. Recently we have seen, as people move into retirement areas in considerable numbers, that even greater pressure is being placed on the coastline, so coastal management is a very important area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why Senator Faulkner announced a $53 million package and why the centrepiece of that package is Coastcare&mdash;a cooperative arrangement where people can be involved at the community level in dealing with these issues. As the member for Franklin would know, in terms of coastal management it is the involvement and motivation of the local community that is extraordinarily important. The honourable member would know that a model program has been developed in the north-east of coastal Tasmania, his state, in an area as large as Sydney Harbour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extraordinarily important experiment being conducted under the so-called ILAP program. The methodology was developed on the basis that much of this coastal management statement was prepared. This program, which integrates local area management, enables cooperation between the three tiers of government and cooperation with community groups to achieve the care necessary for our coastline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with previous announcements which have come out of the budget, the opposition's response has been lukewarm to say the least. Senator Kemp said this is a statement long on platitude but short on specific outcome. This is the same opposition spokesperson who is not in favour of environmental treaties or reliance on international treaties in terms of the environment. He is someone who so far, despite some promises, has made no significant statements in terms of any aspect of the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This goes to the core of Liberal Party philosophy, as articulated by the previous leader when he referred to the term `subsidiarity', when he referred to the essence of Liberal philosophy, which is about devolution rather than terms of cooperation with a national framework. This program will be successful because it will involve three levels of government working in cooperation, partnerships in the local community, a focus in terms of area and an approach by this government that is fundamentally different from the opposition's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why on issues such as coastal management and the environment we have from the opposition a conspiracy of silence, an inability to say anything of real substance&mdash;because at the end of the day it is all about states rights, it is all about avoiding leadership and it is all about doing effectively the reverse of what this statement on coastal management does. I am sure the member for Franklin, along with other members with substantial areas of coastline in their electorates, will find this statement, the dollars associated with it and particularly the empowering of people at the community level to be of very great assistance and very effective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The quality of health care in Australia is a matter of great significance to governments, to health professionals and, most vitally, to all Australians who need health care assistance. This statement reports to the House the first results of an important study&mdash;the Australian hospital care study&mdash;which presents a challenge to governments and to health professionals. I will describe these results and set out the approach that the government plans to take to respond to the challenge of producing better quality care, the need for which the study has starkly defined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian hospital care study was commissioned and funded by my department as part of the professional indemnity review. The review was set up in 1991 to look at the adequacy of compensation and funding arrangements for health care misadventures in Australia and will produce its final report shortly. As part of its task, the study looked at adverse events affecting patients in Australian hospitals, both public and private, to which they were admitted in 1992. An adverse event is defined in the study as an unintended injury, which results in a disability, which may include a longer hospital stay, or death, and which is caused by health care management rather than the patient's underlying disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study looked at how many adverse events there were, their causes and factors contributing to their occurrence, the levels of disability resulting from the adverse events, and how preventable they were. It must be emphasised that a good many adverse events are difficult to prevent. When people are very ill and treatment is complex and intensive, when they have multiple conditions and when they no longer have the advantage of the robustness of youth, it can be expected that some proportion of cases will result in injury from the treatment itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to focus on are the adverse events which are judged to be preventable. It is worth pointing out that adverse events are highly correlated with increasing age, but are not correlated with gender, birthplace, aboriginality, marital status or whether the patient is public or private. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study, with its focus on the preventability of adverse outcomes, is a world first. It is a vital milestone for improving public and private hospital outcomes for consumers by better measurement of performance and appropriate improvement in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first results of the study&mdash;which has been carried out by a consortium from the universities of Adelaide and Newcastle&mdash;have only just become available. I am making these results available, at least in this preliminary way, at the earliest opportunity as I believe that Australian health care consumers, professionals and policy makers have a right to know the information as early as possible. Governments and the professions need to be formulating a response without delay. Complete results of the study will be published in the academic literature in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Key results thus far</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study examined the medical records of over 14,000 patient admissions to 28 public and private hospitals in New South Wales and South Australia in 1992. Around one sixth, or 16 per cent, of the hospital admissions during the year of the study were assessed as involving an adverse event. For about half of these&mdash;that is, 8 per cent of the admissions overall&mdash;the adverse events were assessed as being preventable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say that the assessments of whether there was an adverse event, and the degree to which it was preventable, was made by two or three experienced medical assessors reviewing each record after an initial assessment by a nurse. In just over half of the adverse events, the resulting disability lasted less than one month; and in another 30 per cent, the disability was resolved in less than 12 months. However, the other 20 per cent resulted in various degrees of permanent disability or even death. For 0.8 per cent of the total medical records studied, the adverse event resulted in death with 0.5 per cent of the total being judged as preventable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A qualification to these disturbing figures is that, in a proportion of these cases, the seriousness of the patient's underlying condition means they may have died or become severely disabled during the admission, even if the adverse event had not occurred. Nearly half of all the adverse events were associated with an operation, 15 per cent were related to system problems such as inadequate training or supervision or inadequate communication, and 13 per cent were diagnostic errors. About 75 per cent of the adverse events occurred in an acute hospital, with around 8 per cent occurring in a doctor's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the study sample involved just 28 hospitals in two states, the study methodology is rigorous and should allow the results to be applied to the Australian hospital system as a whole. I will table a paper shortly setting out in more detail the background and methodology adopted by the study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the study results were generalised to Australia as a whole, 230,000 public and private hospital admissions in 1992 would have involved an adverse event which was preventable. It is of great concern to me that between 25,000 and 30,000 people would have experienced an adverse event that resulted in some degree of permanent disability, and between 10,000 and 14,000 people would have died. It must be stressed that, although the actual timing of many of these deaths may have been preventable, death itself may have been highly likely because of frailty or the severity of the person's illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human implications of these results are clearly a matter of considerable concern to me, as I am sure they will be for all of you and for other health ministers in Australia. As I have said earlier, I have decided to release them now, so that they can be a trigger for effective action. There will be a closer examination of the study when it is published, but I believe that the evidence is sufficiently stark to warrant immediate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the human implications of these figures, these findings indicate another cost as well. The total hospital bed-days attributable to adverse events in 1992 on the basis of the study figures is 3.2 million, with around half of these relating to preventable adverse events. This preventable proportion amounts to over 8 per cent of all bed-days in that year. A reasonable estimate of the cost of these bed-days would be around $650 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is vital that action is taken by the Commonwealth, the states, who are responsible for public hospital management, private hospital proprietors and the professions to address these issues as a matter of urgency. Today I have written to state health ministers and I will be raising these issues at the Health Ministers Forum to be held tomorrow and the Health Ministers Conference to be held on 15 June. I have also taken steps to consult with relevant professional organisations. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What can we do?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of the study are not welcome news. They are, however, a call to action. We can be satisfied that we have had the courage to do the study fully and rigorously&mdash;few other countries have done so. Now we must respond to the challenge it represents. More analysis is needed of the data obtained in the study before we know the areas of highest priority for action and before proper prevention strategies can be developed. The consortium is proceeding with this analysis at the moment. However, I believe we need a concerted effort from all interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, as part of the study, medical reviewers were asked where efforts should be directed to prevent recurrence for each adverse event that had any possibility of preventability, the area of quality assurance and peer review was cited in 56 per cent of cases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can be encouraged in this regard by the experience of anaesthetics which, despite its inherent dangers, was assessed as being related to only two per cent of the adverse events in the study. This seemingly low result can be attributed to the strenuous efforts of the anaesthetists in Australia over the years to establish and continue a system whereby adverse events are reported and investigated&mdash;in particular, anaesthetic deaths are individually closely examined and the assessments reported from time to time in a public document. A not dissimilar process has been adopted for maternal deaths. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The study that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has outlined is disturbing, but to anyone working in the hospital system I could not suspect that it was surprising or new. In fact, if anything is surprising it is that it is only now we are starting to take account of these things that people have been talking about anecdotally for a long time. Anyone working in the hospital system knows the stresses that are involved and, indeed, these figures that the minister has talked about today are from 1992. Quite possibly, three years later, today, the figures are worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I look through the minister's speech I see the implication that a lot of adverse incidents could be prevented. There seems to be an implication that if we do something we could prevent some of these bad results. The minister stated that 56 per cent of respondents said that quality assurance and peer review was the best way to go. I have heard the government talking about quality assurance and peer review for a decade now. It is not unreasonable at this stage to suggest that the government should have something in place which is effective. The problem is about the behaviour of human beings&mdash;it is human problems, human failings and the training of humans. The response has to be about getting people to change their behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's response is long on analysis. That is not a surprise, given that she was talking about a major report. But it is short on solutions. Two things come through to me from her statement. Firstly, there is a lack of a cohesive approach in our hospitals. There has not been a building of cohesive teams, as there might have been. The second issue relates to resources and pressures on the working environment of hospitals. I accept that in this report resources are ranked by only four per cent as a significant issue. Communications procedures are ranked by 50 per cent. I suspect that, when she sits down after the event and looks at the position in the quiet analysis of daytime, she might get a slightly different perspective. My first political involvement in the medical profession was when I found a colleague slumped in a corner of the residents quarters at 4.30 one morning, sobbing because he could not cope with the workload.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the present budget there is an increase in expenditure for drugs of about 12 per cent, for general practitioner consultations of about 10 per cent and on public hospitals of 2.8 per cent, or a real 0.7 per cent decline. Considering that this report is, in part, about public hospitals, you have to wonder about the allocation of resources. The minister realised this in 1990 when she was Premier of Western Australia. She wrote to the then Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lower Medicare benefit levels for Western Australia are only partially offset by higher Commonwealth grants to the Western Australian government. . . The Medicare arrangements have placed considerable demands on the State's public hospitals, and it is therefore important that the State not be further burdened as a result of Commonwealth health funding anomalies.</PARA>
<PARA>You only have to walk around any public hospital anywhere in Australia&mdash;not in one particular state or another&mdash;to see that, quite frankly, they are bursting at the seams. That is why the results today may be worse than they were in 1992, which is the year to which the figures in this statement refer. The main reason is probably communications and procedures in hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the solutions looked at here are practical solutions, not theoretical solutions. You can write proposals until you are blue in the face but, in the end, they are no good if they sit on someone's desk. This was very clearly illustrated to me recently in a discussion about the potential of needlestick injuries to transmit HIV in hospitals in New South Wales. Every hospital in New South Wales has procedures. When they tried to find out where these procedures were and why so many potentially damaging needlestick injuries were occurring, they found the procedures sitting on the desks of the administrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope something good comes out of this statement. I hope blame does not come out of it. I commend the minister for making this ministerial statement. I hope she does not mind if I say that I am awaiting a ministerial statement on the Gregory report and the Baume report. I look forward very much to such a statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much appreciate her talking about outcomes. I suggest that she might at the same time look at outcomes in the Common</PARA>
<PARA>wealth-state disability agreement and in preventive health, particularly immunisation. She might look at tying outcomes to the better practice program and the national AIDS strategy in Aboriginal health. We would support all of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I make the observation that, while, on the face of it, our results appear much worse than those in the United States, it is quite possible that the United States was looking at a much narrower range of potential adverse events, and they may not be readily comparable. I thank the minister for her courtesy in making this report available to me earlier Provided we do not have a bureaucratic response but a practical one that is focused but achievable, the government will have the opposition's support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially, I thank the government for giving me time to make a response, here in the House, to the statement of Senator Gareth Evans made in another place earlier this day. There have been very unfortunate recent discussions publicly in Australia about the Australian intelligence services. Much of what has been discussed publicly in the media, I do not want to canvass here today for very good reasons of national interest. But I want to make three or four points that come out of today's statement by Senator Evans in his response to the Samuels Inquiry into the Australian Secret Intelligence Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing I would make clear is that the coalition believes that Australia does have an effective and responsible intelligence establishment, and effective and responsible intelligence services, including ASIS. There are some who argue that in the post-Cold War environment there is no need any longer for intelligence services, and that, indeed, the only real value of intelligence nowadays is economic intelligence. That is manifestly untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who think that gaining intelligence of a wide variety, not just economic intelligence but intelligence on security issues, in particular, is unimportant are people who have no real understanding of this country's national interests. It is vastly important that we have effective intelligence collection, particularly in the post-Cold War environment where we cannot simply rely on the truisms of the past, the one side versus the other. We have to operate in a much more unpredictable and uncertain international environment, and we have to do so much more from our own resources than depend on what used to be described as great and powerful friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has real strength in the area of intelligence and should be proud of its intelligence resources. In addition, it has close links with a range of other countries&mdash;a wide range of other countries&mdash;not least the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and, indeed, to a lesser extent, New Zealand. So we do have a good intelligence capability, we do have a widespread intelligence capability&mdash;and that is a national asset which the coalition believes is worth preserving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, a large number of allegations have been made over recent months about what the Australian intelligence services have been doing. Consistent with the position of the government, I will not comment on those allegations in substance at all. But I would make this point: there is something wrong&mdash;and there is, in particular, something wrong with morale and ministerial administration of intelligence services if these kinds of stories and, in particular, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> episode of 1994, gained such prominence. I will come back to the government's responsibility and, in particular, Senator Evans culpability in this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in response to the recommendations Senator Gareth Evans has put forward that the coalition has, via me as the shadow minister, had the opportunity on two or three occasions to discuss these recommendations with Senator Evans. Through those discussions Senator Evans has always been very reasonable in listening to the point of view of the coalition and has been from time to time prepared to make adjustments with that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the actual recommendations Senator Evans has announced today&mdash;I will not canvass them for we do not want to spend too much time on this matter&mdash;the coalition is, in general terms, in support of them. Of course, we await the legislation and I cannot personally make a commitment that the coalition will support in legislation every single aspect of this. It certainly is true that we are happy to go along with the broad outline of what Senator Evans has said today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point, though, is the point about Senator Evans himself and his culpability in this whole matter. The simple fact is that ministers under our system are responsible for departments and agencies within their portfolios. Even on the coalition side as an opposition, we accept that shadow ministers are responsible for what goes on in their portfolio areas as far as opposition activities are concerned. Senator Evans is therefore responsible for what has happened at ASIS which, in turn, led to this judicial inquiry, its report and, finally, the government's response to that report. In administering his duties, Senator Evans has been grossly negligent and totally incompetent. He has also misled the Senate and, I believe, has destroyed his reputation as a public figure through the way he has handled this whole affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the heart of what Senator Evans has done. There are four basic points that need to be made. First, Senator Evans has failed to implement an adequate grievance procedure for complaints by ASIS staff until now. The minister has a special duty of care for ASIS because the employees of ASIS do not have the normal appeal mechanisms that apply to the bulk of the Australian Public Service. That means that the minister has on his shoulder a greater weight of responsibility for those people who are employed in ASIS. Senator Evans has quite clearly not understood his special duty of care, nor executed his special duty of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been evidence since 1990 of gross dissatisfaction within ASIS at the grievance procedures. The minister failed to adopt new grievance procedures for ASIS after ASIO introduced its new grievance procedures in 1991. A model existed, but it was ignored. The minister, importantly, ignored the advice of the Inspector-General to revise and expand the grievance procedure system in 1992. Let the House be well aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Senator Evans was prepared to say earlier today in a television debate with me that he had had representations from the Inspector-General for more resources over quite a period of time in order to improve the capacity of the Inspector-General to deal with grievances, and Senator Evans rejected that application from the Inspector-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister failed to act on the advice of the Director-General of ASIS in February 1994 when the Director-General advised the minister of the need to hold an inquiry into individual complaints. The minister rejected that advice. That is perfectly clear and unequivocal, and no casuistry by Senator Evans is going to get him out of the trap he has set for himself and walked into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that on 10 February 1994 he was advised by the Director-General to establish an inquiry into the complaints and if an inquiry was not established there was a danger the complainants would leak to the media and there would be public exposure and controversy. If Senator Evans had acted on the advice of his Director-General, then it may well be that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program and the embarrassment that caused to the Australian government and the Australian people would have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Gareth Evans sat on his hands and did nothing. He told the Senate on 22 February that he had no intention at all of establishing an inquiry into the grievances of the complainants; something that he told the Senate this week he did not do. In other words, Senator Evans misled the Senate on that matter. So, by failing to act, the minister has ended up by being totally responsible for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners </EMPHASIS>exposure and the embarrassment that occurred to Australia and its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Evans's second real point of failure is that he failed to protect national security by refusing to act on the reports that the agents were going to go public. I have made that point sufficiently without having to repeat any of those aspects. I remind the House that at the Senate estimates committee hearing on 22 February 1994 Senator Evans said that he had no intention of holding an inquiry. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inspector-General's judgment is that those particular grievances have been settled as a result of an extended inquiry process&mdash;a very detailed consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the Inspector-General's judgment. The Samuels inquiry shows that to have been wrong. Senator Evans went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my own judgment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not the Inspector-General's or anybody else's, but his&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that those cases have been fully and fairly resolved; I have seen the documentation associated with them. It is not proposed to open those matters for review.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans was, therefore, totally responsible. Later, as I have explained, he decided that he had always been thinking of having a review, even though he told the Senate it was not proposed to open those matters for review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The third point&mdash;a related point&mdash;is that Senator Evans failed adequately to examine the individual cases. I just want to go to the heart of that matter. He repeatedly assured the Senate that there was an exhaustive and exhausting investigation by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. He took personal responsibility and made a virtue of it by declaring:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inspector-General's judgment is that those particular grievances have been settled as a result of the extended inquiry process; a very detailed consideration. It is my own judgment that those cases have been fairly and fully resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have seen the documentation associated with them. It is not proposed to open those matters for review.</PARA>
<PARA>Thus he assumed personal responsibility after having reviewed the documents himself. If I can put it this way: he certainly fails the McLachlan standard of responsibility which says that a minister must be responsible for acts of staff&mdash;more so when, in this case, the minister has exhaustively examined the details and taken personal responsibility before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The final point I want to make is on the question of the preparation of the psychological report into one of the complainants. This report was prepared and has been a very controversial matter. I do not wish to canvass it at great length, except to say that Senator Evans was aware that this psychological report had been prepared. He was aware that there were allegations that the report had been improperly prepared. Senator Evans decided to leave it up to ASIS as to what should be done with the report. Despite the fact that Senator Evans knew that psychological report had been inadequately prepared&mdash;or, at least, that there were allegations that it had been improperly prepared&mdash;he decided to leave it up to ASIS as to what should be done with it. He decided he did not really care about the allegations of improper preparation and that he would wash his hands of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The report was used in the briefing of members of the opposition. As the Samuels commission findings reported, the use of that psychological report was `highly inappropriate'. Now Senator Evans says, `Well, yes, it was highly inappropriate. I couldn't agree more with the Samuels inquiry.' But it is his responsibility that the psychological report was used by ASIS in that improper way because he, Senator Evans, decided he did not care what happened to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at the whole catalogue of disasters surrounding this affair, you see that the responsibility falls back on the shoulders of Senator Evans. No amount of circumlocution or casuistry is going to get Senator Evans out of the fact that he is a minister, paid as a minister and believed to be responsible as a minister for what goes on within his own department and its agencies. The simple fact is that the Samuels inquiry, a judicial inquiry, has damned the performance of Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier in my speech, the reputation of Senator Evans as foreign minister will be tarnished for all time because it has been revealed yet again that Senator Evans is a man who does not care about the people who work in his department or in agencies under his control. He is a man who has grand visions for multilateral diplomacy&mdash;some of which are not only grand but impractical&mdash;but he is not a man who cares about the people for whom he is responsible. In this particular case he was especially responsible for them because of ASIS's understandable status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to finish by repeating a very important point: the coalition has acted in a way which could only be described as extraordinarily responsible through these difficult times. There have been plenty of opportunities for us to make political points out of allegations made by people surrounding the Australian intelligence community. We have not been prepared to capitalise on those opportunities because we put the national interest first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But never let it be forgotten that the extraordinary debacle that has occurred in relation to the Australian intelligence effort has occurred in the last few months under the guidance of Senator Evans, who is totally responsible for matters which have occurred. As I said, his reputation will be forever tarnished by this shoddy affair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the Reserve Bank Act, the Reserve Bank has its own superannuation fund called the Officers Superannuation Fund, or OSF. Having its own fund is, presumably, a sign of the bank's independence from the federal government&mdash;a notion we all encourage. However, there is a problem. Plainly, the Reserve Bank is in possession of market-sensitive information. Indeed, given its control over short-term interest rates and its influence in the bond market, we can fairly say that no institution has more market-sensitive information than the Reserve Bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some people&mdash;millions of ordinary Australians whose own superannuation funds have done so poorly in recent years&mdash;it might seem odd that the bank should have its own superannuation fund when it is potentially in a position to know market movements in advance. This enormous potential conflict could be easily solved by having the OSF managed entirely at arms length so that there is no possibility of the people making the investment decisions knowing anything about either forthcoming changes in monetary policy or the bank's own trading activities in the bond and foreign exchange markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this is not the case. While the equity and property portions of the portfolio are managed outside the bank, the fixed interest or bond portfolio is managed in-house, under the supervision of the OSF's investment committee. What astonishes me is that sitting on the investment committee is the assistant governor for financial markets and a senior officer of the domestic markets department of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee makes the asset allocation decisions for the fund&mdash;when to buy bonds and when to buy equities, and vice versa&mdash;yet it seems that these two officers are in charge of the bank's own trading. I must ask: how could the Governor of the Reserve Bank allow such a situation to exist?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if that does not seem peculiar enough, the situation takes a more serious turn when we learn that the investment performance of the OSF has been amazingly good. It has outperformed other funds of an equivalent size by a country mile. Since the financial year 1991-92, its annual return has never fallen below 10 per cent. In the financial year 1993-94, a year when the bond markets went through the floor, the OSF's rate of return was 12.9 per cent&mdash;a good deal ahead of the average for funds of its size of 7.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not permit me today to elaborate in any detail on the movements in the weightings of the OSF's portfolio, but I ask members of this House whether they have ever heard of a superannuation fund with no fixed interest assets&mdash;no bonds; none; zero weighting. I invite them to look at the portfolio of the OSF for the end of June 1994. Its weighting in fixed interest was zero. I ask: did its consultant, Towers Perrin, recommend a zero weighting? I have my doubts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say clearly now that it seems very unfair for ordinary Australians that the Reserve Bank is apparently able to engineer for its own superannuation fund a higher performance than what any of the rest of us can ever aspire to in our funds, which have performed so badly. We do not have a zero weighting in bonds when the bond market is going through the floor. For the rest of us, when we put our money in some superannuation funds we may as well bend over, put our heads between our legs and kiss our backsides goodbye.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Frankly, I am sick and tired of Mr Hollis attacking me on a personal basis.</PARA>
<PARA>But Senator Baume, in his usual way, again raised in his 11 May 1995 speech allegations concerning my former employment at the Workers Educational Association and suggested that I table a report from a Coopers &amp; Lybrand inquiry about me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose Senator Baume believes that if he makes these claims often enough someone might believe him. If he is so sure of his facts, let him repeat his claims outside of parliamentary privilege. This morning I received a letter from the executive director of the Workers Education Association. I wanted to table the letter and, in parliamentary practice, I approached the opposition member at the table, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), and he refused me permission. So I will now read the letter I received this morning into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Hollis,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have received your letter of 31 May regarding various allegations, made under Parliamentary privilege, relating to the period when you were employed as the WEA Illawarra Regional Secretary. Firstly, I wish to stress, the WEA has not instigated any enquiries against you, secret or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No enquiry has been made by the WEA Illawarra into your financial dealings and we have not supplied any information about you or any other former employee to any other person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I and other members of the WEA have nothing but respect for your work with the WEA. During your employment with the WEA in the Illawarra you raised its profile and made it widely known in the community. I have never seen any hint of irregularity in your work with the WEA, nor am I aware of any minutes in which, it is claimed, you retrospectively approved payments to yourself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have the highest regard for your work with the WEA and can only suggest that you request that Senator Baume place his information on the public record. We are concerned that the WEA's name is being used for scoring political points. If you have precise details of the documentation mentioned by Senator Baume I would be pleased to provide them, if they exist.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter was signed by Eric Williams, the executive director. I request that Senator Baume repeat any allegation he has made about me regarding my employment with the WEA outside of the parliament. I stress that there will be no more 58 pages to three every time Michael Baume vomits his bile against me or my staff. As Michael Baume is so interested in raking over the past, perhaps it is time that a few in this place and in the Senate turn their attention to his role in Patrick Partners where thousands of pensioners lost their life savings. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight because I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that last night the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) made a few comments about the game of rugby league. I think it is right that these comments should be made in this chamber at this time. I would like to also indicate my interest in the game of rugby league, as you would know, Mr Speaker, as vice-president of the very prestigious and very formative rugby league support group in Parliament House. I believe we are a group that can be asked for assistance in support of this great game of rugby league right across Australia, but I hasten to add that we take no position in the current dispute&mdash;only to see its end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join in the spirit of this debate because some 40 years ago I used to play the game myself. I have always encouraged my sons to play, but I can see very little comparison between the game we played then and the game that is played now&mdash;except that we played it for the sport of the occasion and not so much for the money. This is one of the changes the member for Werriwa mentioned last night. There have been great changes&mdash;a change in lifestyle and a change in social development and the expectations of people&mdash;to the code as we know it today. While we might regret some of the things that have happened, I believe they were inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the member for Werriwa that I too was a great supporter of the St George Football Club when it was in what we knew as the Sydney Rugby League, for the very reason that it was the only club that would travel north during the off-season and play games against clubs such as Mackay. I do not think it ever left Mackay without having a win of something like 70-0 or 80-0, but the club was a great advocate of the game in Sydney and the pinnacle of anybody's support of the code was to look at Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Sydney code at that time, 20 or 30 years ago, was an organisation unto itself, and probably was world class. Since then, changing times have meant that it became the New South Wales Rugby League&mdash;as we had the Queensland Rugby League&mdash;and it has now become the Australian Rugby League. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to look carefully at both sides of this argument to see what can be done to improve the situation. We need to look not so much at where the faults lie but at where the game should go from here. It could be said that the Australian Rugby League may not really have the facilities or the knowledge to take the game from a capital city sport to an Australian sport or, more importantly, to meet the international standards expected today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I hate to mention the State of Origin last night in your presence. It was a great victory for Queensland, who were the underdogs. Even though the New South Wales team had better players, it did not have the teamwork to go with it. Queensland, who was the underdog, played well as a team. My heart goes out to Paul Vautin, to whom I offer my sincere congratulations. He took over what was regarded as an impossible job, and he did it so well. The players combined as a team and supported Paul Vautin last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a test of where football is in Australia. It is a test for those players who are regarded as Australian players but who missed out because they have gone to Super League or are going next year. I believe the performance of all the players last night demonstrated that second-fiddle footballers who will be called upon from time to time might just give those recognised players room for contemplation in relation to how they play and where they can go from here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us settle this argument, but I believe some pertinent questions need to be answered before we can bring this to a finality. Who is on the board of the ARL? What is their expertise? Do they truly encompass all of Australia? I know that the Raiders and the Broncos have severe reservations about whether they fit nicely into that code. Who appoints the members? Who are they? What is their authority? Where do we go from here? Has the 20-team competition been a success? While the game is still being played, I believe that question has to be answered at the same time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House the situation in the Italian community. As you are aware, Mr Speaker, my electorate of Lowe has a large number of residents who were born in Italy, although they have spent 30 years or more working and living in Australia. The contribution of these people to the growth and development of our country is beyond compare. Our quality of life is as high as it is directly because of the migration of Italians to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990s many of these Australians who were born in Italy are of retirement age. It is incumbent upon this parliament to see that this well-earned retirement is made as comfortable as possible.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some personal experience of the difficulties faced by elderly retired persons of Italian sponsored retirement centres. It is a medical fact that, as some people age, their cognitive facilities decline and their comprehension weakens. This is often manifest by a reversion to their original language. Thus it is an actual occurrence&mdash;I have experience of it&mdash;that people who have lived for 40 years or more in Australia go into a retirement home and revert to their Italian language comprehension only. They lose totally the facility for the second language that they may have spoken for over 40 years. This may sound strange to members but it does occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scalabrini Village does excellent work in relation to these retirees, but it is hampered by the lack of Italian speaking nurses. It has Italian speaking staff, but nursing staff speaking Italian are needed because the elderly have need of medical attention. I understand that matters dealing with nursing are a state responsibility. I have written to the New South Wales Minister for Health, Dr Andrew Refshauge, and asked for his assistance in meeting this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter is one of growing concern within the Italian community. The well-known and highly respected journalist Mr Paolo Totaro recently wrote of this matter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. He made the point that Australia has avoided the ethnic troubles of other nations because our policy of inclusiveness was supported in a bipartisan manner and the authorities do not leave groups to flounder in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Care and concern, by individuals and government bodies, have a major pay-off for a nation as a whole. We are a calm and peaceful society because of our superior policies in this field. These policies have been followed by governments of both persuasions for over 50 years. Now is the time for all members to look closely at the problems associated with the retirement of these persons who have come to Australia at our invitation over the past 15 years. Allow me to quote from the Totaro article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the Italo-Australian community there are an estimated 3,500 Alzheimers sufferers. And there is an explosion of demand for bi-lingual nursing care, generally unavailable in hospitals. With immigration from all Mediterranean countries virtually closed for nearly a generation, there is little hope for those immigrant groups. The Federal government has allowed the entry of many nursers from Ireland. Good. But why not from the other countries.</PARA>
<PARA>I remember attending a function at such a retirement village&mdash;not an Italian one but another one in my electorate at Strathfield&mdash;where an elderly lady took hold of me by the hand. She talked to me for about 15 minutes and she would not let go of my hand. She was talking in a foreign language. When I asked the people who owned the place where she was from, they pointed out that nobody in the nursing home where she had been a resident for two years spoke her language. She spoke a dialect from a part of India, and there was no-one there to speak to her. Mr Speaker, you can imagine her isolation after being there for two years and having no-one to converse with. I may not have understood her words, but I certainly understood her problem. I want to help people like her, and I am sure that honourable members here would also want to help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think both the federal and state governments, as a matter of urgency, should cooperate and coordinate a policy that will allow for a rapid solution to the problem of the unfortunate lack of bilingual nurses. I am aware of the questions of accreditation and the like, but this problem is real and pressing. I am confident that, with goodwill, we can overcome the difficulties. These retirees enriched our lives and cultures. We owe them a great deal. It will be to our credit if we can ease their retirement and repay a little of the debt that we owe them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this evening, my colleague the member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) raised a very interesting question: the mysterious investment record of the Reserve Bank's superannuation fund. Some other aspects of this should be on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past two, three, in fact four years, the OSF has been the top performing fund among all government sponsored superannuation funds in Australia. Some clue of the OSF's amazing performance in 1993-94 is to be found in the changes to the asset allocation. At the end of June 1994, just six weeks before the bank changed policy and began raising interest rates, the OSF's fixed interest weighting was zero. Thus the fund was conveniently quarantined from plunges in the bond market caused by the bank's change in policy. While the rest of Australia suffered as the bonds in our super funds lost value, members of the OSF were safe and getting safer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs explanation now is how a superannuation fund can have no fixed interest assets. Did the OSF's investment consultant, Towers Perrin, recommend a nought per cent weighting for those assets? If it did not, why did the investment committee go below the recommended weighting? What did the members of the investment committee know that Towers Perrin and the rest of the market did not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of whether a breach of the superannuation fund law has occurred. It seems extraordinary that the trustees of a fund could legally reduce the fixed interest weighting of such a fund to zero. Such an aggressive investment strategy smacks of the worst excesses of the 1980s and is, on the face of it, highly speculative, especially coming from the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably, the OSF's zero weighting in fixed interest assets is not still the case. The bank raised interest rates three times&mdash;the last being on 14 December 1994. Accordingly, we must ask when the OSF started buying fixed interest assets again. Did the investment committee buy bonds after 14 December 1994 and, if so, what did it know about the bank's monetary policy? Did it buy bonds before the governor of the bank, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or the Treasurer (Mr Willis) made any comment to the effect that further interest rate rises were unlikely?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is deeply unfair for ordinary Australians&mdash;the vast majority of people locked into superannuation funds as a result of this government's policy&mdash;is that the people who managed the OSF are apparently able to engineer a higher performance for their own superannuation fund than that which the private sector funds can achieve for everybody else. Therefore, officers of the bank have to demonstrate publicly that no potential exists which would allow the impression to remain that there may be officers of the Reserve Bank who are apparently able to derive a benefit, while at the same time carrying out their activities on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this House this week I challenged the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to answer three simple questions about the $250,000 taxpayer funded sex guide which was published as a supplement to last December's issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS>. My questions were sparked by an article about the controversial sex guide which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> on 30 April. In the article, the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) is quoted, in a letter to a constituent, as saying that the minister had `apologised for any offence caused by sections of the guide' and `because of concerns raised the guide is no longer being circulated'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then asked the minister three simple questions: had she in fact apologised for the sex guide, was she responsible for removing 40,000 extra copies from circulation and did she endorse the member for Lilley's reported quote that the guide contains `references to sodomy that should have been excluded'? A simple yes or no answer would have been sufficient. But alas, the minister let fly with a long self-justifying tirade that if we did not like the practices then we should not read the guide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also said that the guide is targeted at 18- to 35-year-olds. We are all well aware that women as young as 12 or 13 years of age are reading this publication and publications like it. In the Senate yesterday Senator Abetz asked whether the type of content found in the guide would be a suitable matter for discussion for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with his children around the table. To this, two government senators said that he was sick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Abetz made the point well. Indeed, it is sickening to think that the Prime Minister's kids, or anybody's kids for that matter, should be subjected to that sort of material. Although Senator Abetz made the point fairly provocatively, it raised the point that if it is not suitable material for the Prime Minister's kids, it is not suitable for any other kids around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If 40,000 copies of this guide were withdrawn from circulation and if the minister expended another $20,000 of taxpayers' funds, as a senate estimates committee revealed, on yet another evaluation of the guide ahead of the distribution of 40,000 guides, it says to me that the minister or her department have some grave misgivings about it because otherwise it would be in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, 4,000 people in my electorate have voiced their objection to the guide. Senator Herron has tabled in the Senate over 100,000 signatures of people who object to the guide. Of the $250,000, $200,000 went to Australian Consolidated Press and $50,000 was associated with the distribution and publication of additional copies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in Victoria school teachers were provided with copies of the guide by a well known condom manufacturer. I think this whole sorry episode illustrates that the guide is not something that should be treated with respect. The government is clearly uneasy about it and Senator Herron, a well-known colorectal surgeon, has said it is medically dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not dispute, and never have disputed, the need for genuine sex education. Preferably it should be delivered by parents, but if it is delivered in schools or in responsible publications I would have no beef with it. I do not oppose AIDS prevention measures and the necessary publications that go along with that. I object to a publicly funded guide&mdash;available to young people&mdash;parts of which promote as acceptable, normative and even titillating, practices that are medically and morally dangerous and arguably run contrary to the government's AIDS prevention measures. I think the reluctance of the minister to answer the specifics of this matter raises questions about whether the government promotes one line for public consumption while its members promote another modified, if not contrary view, to their individual constituents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis), following the delivery of the budget a few weeks ago, said that they would go to the nation and on the airwaves in an endeavour to sell this document which we now know to be a very fraudulent and dishonest document. This morning the Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand, was interviewed on the very credible ABC radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>. Most members of the House, and many people throughout the country, listen to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> every morning. Unfortunately, the Treasurer was not honest on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>. He brought forward a large amount of disinformation. If the people listening to that program believed what the Treasurer said, they would have been misled and would have a different impression from reality. The Treasurer made a number of claims. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget was designed to take some pressure off interest rates by means of a fiscal tightening.</PARA>
<PARA>The reality is, according to the Commonwealth Bank, the budget does not alter the outlook for monetary policy to any great extent. The Treasurer further claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This sort of growth means that we can maintain the strong approach to employment.</PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that the budget forecast of 3.75 per cent growth in 1995-96 is well below the 4.75 per cent annual average growth rate which the green paper stated was necessary to get the unemployment rate down to 5 per cent by the year 2000. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're also seeing the continuance of low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the implicit price deflator for private consumption rose by 1.2 per cent in the March quarter, following a rise of 0.2 per cent in the previous quarter. The Treasurer referred to certain comments made by the American Secretary for Labour. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States and its Minister for Labour, Mr Reich, was at the conference complaining bitterly about the adverse effects on the American people of the way in which they deregulated their economy and had very adverse outcomes and lots of working poor. We don't have that problem either.</PARA>
<PARA>This nation has 750,000 workless poor. The unemployment rate in the United States is much lower than it is here. It is only 5.8 per cent there, compared with 8.3 per cent in Australia. According to the Union Bank of Switzerland's 1994 survey <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Prices and earnings around the globe</EMPHASIS>, an unskilled builder's labourer in Los Angeles earns wages 90 per cent higher than a comparable labourer in Australia. The cost of living, excluding rent, in Sydney is 11 per cent higher than it is in Los Angeles. The Treasurer went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is not pursuing a low exchange rate strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>The reality is that in the budget speech the Treasurer boasted that Australia's international competitiveness was now 18 per cent higher than in the September quarter 1990. He said that this improvement in competitiveness was largely caused by a massive 16.6 per cent devaluation in the exchange rate. Why won't the Treasurer speak the truth? Why does the Treasurer insist on misleading those people who listened to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program this morning, who watch the television and see him on television and who listen to and read what he says? He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Productivity was growing at 4.1 per cent for the non-farm market sector in the last 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>Throughout the country output per hour worked in the entire Australian economy has grown by only 0.7 per cent over the year to March 1995. The Treasurer also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget was very much about . . . boosting superannuation in the medium to longer term to give a big increase to private sector savings.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr FitzGerald certainly put the lie to that when he said on Tuesday that national savings and investment would remain low unless taxes on savings incomes were deferred or removed. The household savings ratio fell to the lowest level ever recorded in the March quarter 1995. The Treasurer also claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had in this nation four years of strong growth.</PARA>
<PARA>The GDP growth in the 15 quarters of recovery has been weaker than growth in the corresponding period after the 1982-83 recession. The Treasurer also claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of Australia are not suffering reduced real wages.</PARA>
<PARA>Real wages in 1995 are lower than they were in 1983. This government has an absolutely appalling record. Is it any wonder that this government has no credibility when the Treasurer is prepared to say absolutely anything? He is misleading the people. He is prepared to put out misinformation in the hope of convincing people that the government has done a good job. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill could be described as an omnibus bill in the sense that it amends a number of pieces of legislation which affect the Australian Defence Force and the organisation of the Australian defence forces. It must be well known to many members in this House that my primary interest in defence stems from the fact that the Puckapunyal army base lies within the federal electoral division of McEwen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, there are a number of people in this House today who were recently at Puckapunyal during the conduct of the biannual exercise known as El Alamein where the Army, in conjunction with the Royal Australian Air Force, showed trainees and foreign representatives and members of the Australian parliament the operation of particular types of weapons. For those who were not there may I suggest that in two years time when the Australian Army again conducts El Alamein they make themselves aware of that fact and seek to be invited by the Army to attend that particular activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I support this legislation there are some matters which do cause me some concern. One such matter is in the area of discipline and it arises from the fact that I am both a former member of the police force and a former practising lawyer. I have often thought that members of the Defence Force have fewer rights in the disciplinary area than ordinary civilians or other people who are subjected to quasi or criminal law or other disciplinary type proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that is common in defence forces around the world and I suppose there are strong historical reasons for it. Members of the Defence Force&mdash;Navy, Army or Air Force&mdash;have always been subject to on-the-spot discipline by senior officers, yet they have not always been allowed access to normal legal rights in terms of these charges that you and I or other people in the community would have. However, it is true to say that over the years there has been an improvement in the nature of military discipline and in the nature of how Defence Force personnel are brought before senior officers, boards of review and court martials to have matters heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I have a concern about in this legislation is the amendment which will allow a person to be charged for failing to provide a body specimen&mdash;most commonly a urine sample&mdash;on the order of a senior officer. Obviously, the main purpose of this amendment is to exercise a degree of drug control. It would surprise no-one to hear that the Defence Force is subject to the same problems as the rest of society in that many of the young people there use the product of the Cannabis sativa plant, marijuana, and smoke it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am the first to agree that I would not like to be out on a live firing range with a person under the influence of any drug, be it alcohol or the Cannabis sativa THC component. I can understand that it would be appropriate and proper for reasonable action to take place to prevent people from engaging in such activities if they are involved with live ammunition, particularly the sort we have today. However, it seems to me that there is no limitation in the legislation on when or where an officer can approach another person in the Defence Force and say, `I want a urine specimen here and now.' Frankly, that worries me, although the minister next to me quite rightly has pointed out that it does provide that the person must be in custody, and it was neglectful of me not to point that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the person might be in custody for a matter which is not relevant to a drug-taking offence and it seems to me that that power should be limited to allegations that the person on whom the order is made has been involved with a drug-taking offence and is not just simply in custody for another purpose. There could be, for example, an allegation of theft, and yet, once the person is in custody, the legislation appears to allow for an order to be made to provide a urine sample which could lead to other charges not related to the reason for the original custody. So I do express some concern on that, though fully understanding that any defence force organisation would want to make sure that people who use drugs which can affect performance in the handling of ammunition are properly protected and properly disciplined or, hopefully, counselled in the use of such drugs in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that having seen, at the El Alamein exercises, what a Leopard tank will do with its 105-millimetre cannon, impact shells, high explosives shells and the rest of its armaments, and the machine-guns it also lets loose with, I would hate to think of any person sitting in one of those vehicles who had a view of the world affected by alcohol or other drugs. So I can fully concur with the need to do something about it. But I really think there should be a bit tighter control in the legislation to restrict the capacity to seek an order to provide a urine sample to areas where there is an allegation, at least, of drug involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters which also give me some degree of concern. Whilst this legislation does improve the discipline capacity of the Defence Force and loosens up some of the more rigid procedures that have been there in the past, there is a provision for the appointment of what will be known as `discipline officers.' The discipline officer will basically be appointed to take on the role and the powers of the commanding officer to hear disciplinary procedures against people allegedly in breach of defence or army law or other Defence Force law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be nothing in the legislation which would say that the disciplinary officer has to have any particular qualification or any particular training. I know that, certainly in the Army, when the cadets go through officer training they are, in fact, trained in all aspects of defence law and to act as a disciplinary person, particularly with other ranks. That has been a tradition in the Army, certainly, for a number of years. As I know from when I was a young private myself, in the CMF days, discipline was instant and by a senior officer. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr CLEELAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not the Boer War. However, it is unarguable that this is a more benign way of handling discipline in the Army than what it was. Nevertheless, it seems to be that if we are going to have specialised officers&mdash;officers who are going to be called `discipline officers' and who will take on a specific role in hearing summary matters, not court martial matters, for disciplinary purposes&mdash;they should at least have some degree of specialised training before they are appointed. So I must add that that tends to worry me a bit. It would be nice to think that a discipline officer has, in fact, been given some specific training and, when acting in the role of a discipline officer, will have that specific skill and be able to respond accordingly at any hearing that takes place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of infringement notices is also quite interesting. I must say that it has taken a long while for the Defence Force to catch up with the rest of law enforcement in Australia. But it is good to see that there is the capacity to issue an infringement notice which gives the person to whom the notice has been issued the option of accepting the penalty provided for in that notice&mdash;which, as civilians, we all understand, with speeding charges, for example&mdash;or to seek a hearing to have that matter dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell those who do not know that the `red caps'&mdash;the military police&mdash;at Puckapunyal are certainly very assiduous in enforcing speed restrictions there. The speed restrictions are quite narrow: 20 or 40 kilometres per hour in most of the areas where the establishments are and particularly where the army personnel live. Where the married quarters are in the housing areas at Puckapunyal, for example, from memory there is a 20 kilometres per hour and a 40 kilometres per hour speed limit. I can say without question that the military police there are assiduous in ensuring that people do not speed past those areas. So this will certainly improve the capacity of the Australian Defence Force military police to issue infringement notices and to deal with them. I think the minister would agree that it would also save a bit of money and would be a good budgetary proposal. It might even make a bit of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my experience, since infringement notices came into Victoria for traffic offences, they seem to get issued at twice the rate that summons were ever issued to appear in court. Certainly, the Victoria Police gains 20 per cent of its current budgetary allocation from the money it raises from infringement notices and that tended to worry a lot of motorists in Victoria. You wonder whether the police are there to in fact make revenue for themselves or whether, in fact, they are there&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. And I suppose that if we see speed cameras in Puckapunyal, I might go in in reverse, instead of frontwards, because there are certainly enough speed cameras around my roads at the moment. Overall, in looking at this legislation, I have mainly been concerned with the disciplinary matters. I note also that tape recordings of confessions or admissions are now to be introduced into the system. Again, that is something I support. So apart from some concerns that I expressed about the power to force people to provide urine in certain circumstances, and the capacity and training of discipline officers, I think the legislation has a lot going for it and it has my full support.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern is with the morale of our service men and women, the operational efficiency of our armed forces, the wellbeing of the Australian taxpayer and the harmonious condition of society. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is very wide-ranging. It deals with many subjects, in particular, the conditions under which our military personnel serve, and even defence housing. In that context, I would like to make a few comments about the relocation of military bases away from North Head and Middle Head in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month, in answer to a question on notice from me, the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) declared that the bases were to close and that the land would be sold on the open market for the best possible price. This gives me a number of concerns. First, there is the economic concern. These bases inject $40 million in wages every year into the economy of Warringah. They provide 1,200 jobs and it is inconceivable that any alternative source of employment could be found to match that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, there is the environmental concern. We are talking about&mdash;in North Head and Middle Head&mdash;the last unspoiled headlands on Sydney Harbour. These headlands are not so terribly different today from what they were when Captain Cook sailed past 225 years ago. These headlands are, if you like, the sacred sites of modern Australia and potentially a symbol of the determination of modern Australia to live, as best modern men and women can, in harmony with our environment. The idea that visitors coming to Sydney for the 2000 Olympics should sail down our harbour and, instead of seeing the bushland on those headlands more or less in its natural condition, should see the glaring neon signs for a Club Med on North Head and a Mirage on Balmoral is absolutely appalling. Yet that is exactly what seemed to be contemplated by the minister's answer to my question on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we come to the operational concern. Obviously, the defence forces have got to be configured in such a way as to maximise their operational efficiency, but it seems quite clear that moving these bases away from North Head and Middle Head is motivated not so much by better running of the defence forces as by the government's need to improve its budget bottom line. Indeed, real estate agents have estimated that, if all of that land were sold on the open market, something like $2 billion could be realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the particular case of the school of artillery on North Head. In the wake of the announcement by the Minister for Defence that those bases were to move, he confirmed that the school of artillery is to move from North Head to Puckapunyal within five years. Notwithstanding the many goods works of the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), Puckapunyal is in fact the least favourite destination of Australia's service personnel. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bevis" NAMEID="ET4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr Bevis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The North Shore is much more popular!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EZ5">Mr ABBOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is much better represented in parliament, I suppose. But a recent issue of the Army's magazine ranked various bases in terms of their desirability as locations, and Puckapunyal was motherless last. It is, if you like, the defence equivalent of being sent to Siberia. The rationale for shifting the school of artillery is that it needs to be next to a firing range, and I accept the logic of that. The problem is that moving the school of artillery to Puckapunyal will put it next to a firing range, but it is a firing range that lacks any guns to fire! If a battery of guns were to be moved permanently to Puckapunyal to justify putting the school of artillery there, that would effectively double the size of the school of artillery. The school of artillery would have gone from 100 or so personnel, as it is now, to 200 or so personnel, if a battery were permanently based at Puckapunyal to justify this shift.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, shifting the school of artillery to Puckapunyal is going to be an expensive business. It could be $10 million or $15 million: who knows how many millions? However many millions will be involved, the problem is going to be compounded because $2 million has just been spent at North Head to refurbish the school of artillery. Not only that, but the army's maritime school, which is going to be moved from Chowder Bay up to Townsville&mdash;a move which, I concede, seems to make more operational sense&mdash;has just had $6 million spent on it. So here we have bases that have just been refurbished at very considerable expense and that are about to be closed down. This strikes me as a most serious logistical bungle, in the great traditions of the Crimea. And, of course, it is potentially an environmental bungle, in the great tradition of the government's woodchip decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me assure this House that the people of my electorate are solidly determined to keep the military there, if at all possible. And they are absolutely determined that there shall be no further development on those headlands. In my electorate, two very well attended public meetings&mdash;one of 300 people at Manly about a month ago, and another of 500 people at Mosman about a week ago&mdash;have made it absolutely clear that they want no commercial development on North Head and Middle Head and that, if possible, they wish to keep the military there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the military goes, the government will not be able to sell that land. These dreams of a pot of gold at the end of its budgetary rainbow are simply dreams. The land will not be sold because, to sell land, you have got to give potential buyers permission to develop it, and there is no way that any responsible government confronted with the reality of the environmental jewels that these headlands are would allow the sort of development that would enable that land to be sold for the sort of price that would make moving these bases worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the military moves, the reality will be that my electorate will lose 1,200 jobs. The Australian taxpayer will  needlessly spend tens of millions of dollars and these bases will, in effect, become military ghost towns. If the government does try to sell that land and if developers do try to put Club Meds or Skase Mirages on it, there will be an environmental ruckus that will make the Franklin Dam fight look tame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the government to see sense on this matter, to rethink its decision to move these bases and, in particular, to rethink the decision to move the school of artillery. As the New South Wales Premier, Mr Bob Carr, has made harbour protection one of the priorities of his government, I appeal to him to show that he wants to protect the harbour east of Garden Island and to show that his concern for the harbour is not limited to areas to the west of Garden Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest anyone think this is a matter which concerns only the residents of Mosman and Manly, the other day I received a petition which was signed by over 400 people from Penrith. People in the Labor heartland are just as concerned about the threat to Sydney Harbour as people in the Liberal heartland. This issue unites people across the political spectrum. The speakers I have had at public meetings in my electorate include Tom Uren, the former deputy leader of the Labor Party here in this place; Peter MacDonald, the independent state member for Manly; Doug Sutherland, the former Labor Lord Mayor of Sydney; and Barry O'Keefe, the Chairman of the National Trust of Australia. This issue unites people of all political persuasions. It is a message which the government should listen to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just the other day the government promised to spend $53 million on coastal protection. I applaud anything that the government does to protect our coastline. The best thing the government could do now is rule out commercial development on military land at North Head and Middle Head. In so doing, it would not be spending a cent of taxpayers' money. I make this commitment: I will seek a pledge from the coalition that the Howard government will say that this is a no-go area for commercial development and that military land on North Head and Middle Head will never be sold. </PARA>

In the lead-up to talking about the bill, I want to talk about the Australian Defence Force generally. This year we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War II. It is also the 80th anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli and the 20th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. Our service personnel and ex-service personnel have been in the limelight. They have been attending commemoration services and other functions and have been very much in evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a proud record in its defence forces. Even before Australia was a federated nation, we were sending troops to foreign wars. Most of the wars that our troops have been involved in have been other people's wars. From the Sudan and the Boxer Rebellion through to the Vietnam War and the Gulf War, and through two world wars, we have lost a total of 94,000 of our service people. For a small country, that is a huge contribution in lives. Working with the United Nations, our troops are now very much involved in peacekeeping efforts throughout the world. For the size of our country, that contribution has been disproportionate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence forces also play a strong community role. I thought the member for Warringah might have alluded to that when defending the defence forces in his electorate. In my electorate, RAAF base Richmond carries out a very strong role in the local community. I do not think anyone could have not been aware of the bushfires of January 1994. The RAAF personnel, as well as the army and navy personnel, who came to my electorate, played a very strong role in hazard reduction, firefighting and looking after evacuees from nursing homes. Several nursing homes in my electorate were evacuated to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> at Quakers Hill, which has now been turned into an education facility, and to the RAAF hospital at Richmond. Of course, the Richmond area is more often prone to floods than to bushfires, and defence personnel have done a very strong job in that field also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming from a service family myself, I know what it is like to have a father who is hardly ever there&mdash;a man who walks in wearing a uniform, about whom a child has to say, `Mummy, who is this man?'. Of course, it disrupts family life. I am sure that those, like myself, who went through the war years with a father absent will know that one can never really develop a strong relationship with a person with that kind of disruption in the family. I think it is very important that we be aware of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our services, like the British services on which they were modelled, have been built on tradition. I know that those in the services will still talk about some of the quaint traditions of some of the services. But those things, even though they might be nice historic things, have to change as we progress into a more modern age, to bring them in line with civilian life and life in the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example is the number of women who are now joining the defence forces. When the previous chief of the defence forces, Admiral Beaumont, visited RAAF Richmond, he made it very clear to the personnel there that change was happening and they would have to accept change. I think he went as far as to say that, if they did not like the change towards more women coming into the services, they ought to consider another kind of life. I think the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) alluded yesterday to the fact that we might one day have a woman in one of those senior positions in the defence forces. I hope it is in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at those traditions, we have to move on. When I was reading the explanatory memoranda of this bill, one of the phrases that jumped out at me concerned officers holding their appointments `at the Governor-General's pleasure'. What immediately came into my mind was a court where somebody was sentenced to jail at the Queen's pleasure. Perhaps some officers might consider it to be some kind of incarceration! I think that is among the anachronisms that we have to work through and to change. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those kinds of practices are not in line with modern employment practices in the public service or in the corporate sector. I think that change to the way appointments are made, to bring them more in line with the contracts for specified periods that happen in other fields, is a move forward. That minor change which allows the minister to appoint acting senior officers when the Chief of the Defence Force and his or her deputy are absent for some reason is also a very good move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So are the limited tenure promotions for particular projects. Those might be looked at askance by some people. But, if they look at the legislation, they will see that those people do have a right to refuse. That is something that happens elsewhere, particularly in the public service: people act up in higher positions for a while, then either look for other positions at that grade or move back to their substantive positions. I think that is another way of moving forward, to bring the service life into line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That also goes for the early retirement provisions and the termination provisions. We have all heard and I am sure we all know of people who have been, as we say, `promoted beyond their capacity' because there has not been a facility to move them on if they are not performing well or if what they are doing has reached the end of its shelf life. I think those provisions are about moving into line with modern life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) focused, considerably, on the discipline provisions. I think it is appropriate that the government has announced in its justice statement that it is making the law more accessible to people. It is taking out some of the traditional systems so that people can get access to the law much more easily, and so that situations can be mediated and settled without the need for a court. In this case it will mean that some of those things can be dealt with without the need for a court martial. So those are the main provisions. I do not intend to talk about them at length because I think the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) has done that very adequately in his second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes some other small measures. For example, the measure relating to Defence Force home loans fixes up the gap that some people fell through. Unfortunately, those things sometimes happen but, fortunately, we catch them and fix them in legislation. There are also some superannuation provisions in the bill. Superannuation is considered by the government to be something that is extremely important. The provisions that we brought in in the budget will ensure that more people are involved in saving for their retirement in schemes that will provide them with a decent living when they cease working. Of course, the defence forces have always had a superannuation facility but these provisions will bring them more into line with the broader community. This bill is one of a number of measures which the government introduces to bring previous legislation and regulations up to date and keep us at the level of 1995. I commend the bill and thank the House for the opportunity to speak. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse some of the changes in the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill; I think they are overdue. The disciplinary area becomes simpler and allows for matters of smaller or lesser disciplinary importance to be conducted at the appropriate level. I do not look forward to the day when we have members of the armed forces appearing in a civil type court with legal defence but we are moving in that direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministers will say, `What is wrong with that?' I say that, up until this point in Australia's history, we have looked upon the defence of Australia as a profession that is somewhat different, where persons in some instances have to, without hesitation, respond to a direction. Perhaps it is the intention of the government that we have public service type meetings in the Department of Defence before we do anything. If that is the government's intention, it will achieve that objective. I see elements of that process in the way in which the government has brought forward this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to go through the legislation in some detail. These changes are about getting the pyramids right, basically. The pyramids are out of shape. A number of personnel at various levels within the Defence Force are capable of adjusting, but it can be done only by a slow process because we have permanent commissioned officers in the services. The government has got the system out of whack and now it is going to provide some sort of temporary term of tenure, a renewable contract to get the pyramids right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the government reduced the Defence Force from 22,500 to 17,500. In that process the pyramids went out of shape, and at that time it had to introduce a way in which it could get rid of some of the people at the top. It was stuck with an executive class, an executive level of management above what was required. At the same time as it was pursuing this process, it was proclaiming what an efficient and brilliant defence force Australia had. Those opposite adopted a typical Labor approach to defence, cutting defence at the same time as saying that they were improving it, and in fact they were going on balancing the budget. Where did that practice get us? The military has provided a lot of dollars to the Australian economy. The savings made in defence alone are very large indeed, if we look at the number of personnel that have been moved out of the system. The government has decided to move them out of the system, and it has gone on with record deficits, record bankruptcies and record unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the sacrifice, if you want to put it in those terms, paid by one section of Australia's security system has been substantial, and to no avail. The government has not been able to produce the results in cutting defence that, for instance,  Thatcher was able to produce in Britain or the successive American regimes have been able to produce in that country, because they have gained advantage for the whole nation by reducing their military commitment. But the Australian Labor Party does not see things in that light, because what it does see is the need to stay in power no matter what the cost or who pays. Nothing is too good for the worker or his representative. That is the theme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dealing with the legislation before us, it is about the whole process that I have outlined, about the reduction at the whim of the government of a certain level of defence personnel. It is seeking to get its pyramids right, and I see it as a breakdown of the permanent commissioning of officers. There is no doubt about that. It is a public service approach to managing defence. The government wants to move in that direction, but I do not agree that it is the best direction for us to take. I think that we are getting people in there who adopt the attitude of `Is this a temporary career or a permanent career for me?', and they are in and out of the military as they are in and out of the Department of Environment, Department of Treasury, Department of Finance or wherever their career may lead them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are getting to a point, I would suggest, where we are going to have a pick-up approach. It is not mercenary&mdash;that is an overstatement&mdash;but it is `Come and join the team, because we have got a thing going at the moment, and we will pay you off when the event is over.' The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) can shake his head, but the fact of the matter is that he does have to acknowledge that there are term contracts, people are going to be paid out at the end of those terms, and there is political interference to a degree that I have not seen before, with ministerial interference. I refer to the explanatory memorandum. Where does the minister's role come in, in the decisions regarding brigadier and under brigadier, two stars and under? The minister has a say in that process. That has not been the process until now, as far as advancement, selection of personnel or termination is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that it is a politicisation of a career structure that should not have politics played in it. One of the proud things that Australia has had is a military completely divorced from politics. The minister thinks that it is all right to put people in positions that he wants them to be in. You meet them in a mess or in a ward room and you say, `He is a nice guy and he is politically onside. Why do not we see him move a little quicker through the system?' That politicisation will ultimately destroy the relationship between the military and the political wings of government. It is what happens in every other nation, but it is not a worry to the Australian Labor Party because, again, anything it does in its cause is justified. And I believe that that is what it is doing with this legislation. It is clear to me that ministers now have a role in the promotion and careers of people in the military. The government can apply its will to that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that previously the only role a minister ever had as the chief of the Defence Force was in choosing a candidate from a list put forward by the military asking which one the minister would prefer. The minister would not necessarily get his preference as chief of defence. Now we are going to have ministers who want to manipulate and who want to play games by interfering at a lower level. I do not think that this is in the best interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are moving towards is the politicisation of the military. This will produce a politicised military process in 20 to 50 years time. We will have the situation that exists in Papua New Guinea, and everywhere else where the military can decide that it is in politics, saying, `These guys at the top are not doing what we want and we want to take an active role.' Just think of where we are moving: it is a direction that we should not contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having received all the advice, the minister will come back to me and say, `It really does not matter; it is a small thing; there used to be interference in the past.'

They may be called upon to give their lives. They may be required to go to any part of the world at any time.

The government is aligning the whole of the military process to the public service. This is occurring step by step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, there is the family allowance supplement for below award employment. What did the government do with that? The public servants said that these military employees were below award, and the government decided to give them the family supplement. That was a good decision. But then the public service said, `They are getting subsidised housing.' It might be a dog box somewhere, anywhere that they are sent to in Australia. Because those employees were getting subsidised housing, the public servants wanted to include the value of that subsidised housing in the process, saying, `We cannot let them get one little edge on what are seen as the Canberra bureaucratic standards,' and so that was brought into the system for other ranks. </PARA>

Forty hours work is paid at a lower rate. There is an allowance paid for extra hours of work, but at nothing like overtime rates. Most servicemen do not mind, except that the government then plays on that and expect officers to take time in lieu. Maybe that is a good way to go. As the government runs down the whole process, regrettably the demand on personnel becomes stronger and stronger.

So where does the concept of Commander-in-Chief fit into this? Do government members know? Have they worked it out? No, they have not. They do not know where that process ends. Maybe it stops with the Minister for Defence. Is that where it stops? There are questions being asked out in the community because nobody knows what the government's answers are. Such questions are being asked, and the people want to know. I do not believe that the government has the answers, because it has not thought through the matter of where this stuff takes us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) came in this morning and talked about the finest traditions of the Crimea. Nothing in this place can illustrate more how far behind the opposition is in matters of defence, in comparison with the government. What we now have in this country is in complete contrast to 20 years ago, when those people on the opposition side of the House could reasonably be said to have described themselves as the natural party of government in terms of defence and defence issues. No longer is that so: the roles are reversed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some opposition members have not even bothered to do their homework to check up on a few things&mdash;in stark contrast to the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is the shadow minister, and in stark contrast to the right honourable member for New England, who bothered to acquaint himself about a whole range of issues. Let me deal with a number of points, and firstly with those of the member for Mitchell, who has scurried out of this place. If I had been he, I think I would have done so, too. His first point was that we seem to want to make the military like the public service, that we are going to `public service-ise' the military. But anyone who had read the white paper would know that nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is setting out to explain to the bureaucracy and both sides of politics in this town, and, more importantly, to the public, that military service is like nothing else. As it gets more and more technically oriented and more and more demanding, the public, the bureaucracy and both sides of politics must accept that military service is like nothing else. It has to be treated differently, with all sorts of different allowances and discretions. That is in the white paper; it comes from the government. A lot of what is in that chapter was written by my good self. The contribution on that point from the member for Mitchell could not be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same honourable member went on to talk about reduction in numbers. I do not know whether he reads the international press but, if he had a look at what the British, the Americans, the Germans and so many other countries are doing, he would see that they are reducing their armed forces by numbers far in excess of Australia's. Savings from our 15 per cent force structure review reduction in numbers from the early 1990s have been ploughed back into defence on capital expenditure and increased personnel costs which we will have to continue. The honourable member ought to have a good hard look at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take the opportunity to shatter, once and for all, a few of the salient myths that the opposition likes to cling to about defence expenditure and `them versus us'. The front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 21 November 1991 stated, `Defence budget to drop by $500 million.' That is the opposition's policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Mitchell went on to say that our troops were out there in the scrub living in dog boxes. The honourable member obviously has not been near a DHA housing estate for a long time. I will give honourable members another little statistic. The government is spending six times more on defence force housing than the opposition spent. The member for Mitchell has the audacity to stand up here and say that defence personnel are out there living in dog boxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member went on to say that when the social security changes were brought in the lower ranks lost their family supplement. I think he meant to say that the lower ranks lost their extra family payment. He is quite right. That situation threatened the lower ranks for a short while. About 12 months ago we resolved that situation by reversing and changing it. On our best advice, none of them are affected. That was done in full negotiation between myself and the Minister for Social Security. So, again, the honourable member is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell raised the issue of the tax commissioner and mess fees. He should know that I have personally discussed this with the tax commissioner and that there is a working party between Defence and the Taxation Office. The member ought to know that, if push comes to shove and we cannot get our way on this, the defence forces will challenge the taxation ruling on mess fees. We will not hesitate; we will not blink. So he is wrong on that too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the honourable member talked about overtime and the service allowance. Again, he has missed the news. There has been a relatively recent increase in the service allowance. It was not a couple of dollars; it was 16.6 per cent. I invite the honourable member to go back and find out whether that ever happened under the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the matters raised by the honourable member from Warringah. I have to give credit where credit is due. He is pretty good at beating the drum when an election is approaching. As one professional politician to another, I have got to say that I respect that ability. But, just in case the truth gets in the way of a good story, I want to correct the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Club Med on North Head': a good Sunday paper headline special, is it not? Let me say publicly what we have said before and most directly to him. This government is committed to the preservation of the natural bushland areas on North Head. Any transfer of those areas will carry enforceable obligations to ensure their bushland state. We are ensuring, and will ensure, that the significant historic sites and buildings are preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar situation at Middle Head, our department has joined with the local councils and the New South Wales Department of Planning in undertaking management strategies for that area before disposal. The central objective of the study is to provide what options and guidelines will be needed. That is going to rest very squarely on community consultation with provision for the community, including the councils, to have their say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a steering group has been established, which includes community representatives, state and federal MPs&mdash;including the honourable member for Warringah&mdash;the mayor of Mosman, the Heritage Commission and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. If Club Med ends up on North Head or Middle Head, it will be with the concurrence of the Mosman or the Manly council and the honourable member for Warringah. So let us end this rot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also went on to say that we should keep the artillery school at North Head. I have to say that it is somewhat inappropriate to have an artillery school which is a long way from the field firing range in the middle of the city. It just does not work. This situation has been recognised for many years. Honourable members will recall that, in the early 1980s, when the government was trying to acquire a site in Bathurst-Orange area, this idea was dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Warringah's central point is in regard to the sort of support that will be available and what it will be. I want to place on record that the relocation of the 103rd medium artillery from Holsworthy to Darwin will precipitate a situation, and has always been going to precipitate a situation, where the army would be forced to address the field artillery support for the school regardless of its location. The provision of a depot support battery is, of course, being examined as part of the army structural review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Warringah, I must admit in much less spectacular fashion than the honourable member for Mitchell, is way off beam. He has not done his homework; he does not understand the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the rest of the time available, I will seriously address the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The right honourable member for New England raised a number of points yesterday. These points were quite worth while and they should be answered. Far from what the honourable member for Mitchell was saying about political interference, political appointments and senior armed forces people, I think it has to be stressed in this place that the move to have acting appointments made by the minister as opposed to the Governor-General is for short-term vacancies only. It has to be said that these are where difficulties have arisen in the past and they will obviously continue to arise if an acting appointment is required at short notice. Of course, there are precedents for this approach. The acting appointment as Judge Advocate General under the Defence Force Discipline Act is made by the minister through substantive appointment, although the substantive appointment, as is the case here, continues to be made by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is absolutely no substance to what the member for Mitchell was saying. But in response to the member for New England one has to emphasise that these are short-term appointments and are designed to make the system work far better. A number of members raised the disciplinary issues. I think the member for New England did also and he, in particular, raised the question of whether there should be a quasi-judicial hearing in relation to the suspension from duty. I think the crux of the matter is that the refusal to submit to a medical examination will be an offence where a person is already in lawful custody. So it is a very serious issue already. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will come to that. In response particularly to the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), the provision only applies to persons in custody and under investigation. Very clearly, they are serious service offences and they are for testing. The provisions can only be used for drug testing and the member must be first warned that refusal to submit to examination or to supply a specimen will constitute an offence. I must say here that we should not be confusing this with the random urinalysis program which is also aimed at the drugs issue. I will also take the opportunity to note in passing that the normal testing regime for the presence and concentration of drugs in the blood will not in any way, I am informed, reveal the presence or otherwise of the AIDS virus. So this is not some subtle way of trying to get around it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I say to the member for New England that we are wrestling with this problem as we speak. In relation to the payment situation, the fact of the matter is that section 100, as it stands now, provides that a member does continue to be paid. This is, of course, contrary to the rules for members of the public service who have been suspended from duty. But, more importantly, the amendment to section 100 will contain a provision for cases of proven hardship. Where a member suspended from duty will not normally be entitled to the payment of salary and allowances after he or she has been charged with an offence, a member who is suffering hardship can apply for the payment to be continued. In practice, those charges will only come about after service or civilian police investigation and legal advice that the member should be charged. So in fact there will have been quite a process, as is the standard with any charge in that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we will look at it; I acknowledge that that is a good point. On the other issues that have been raised, I must say that in relation to the management-initiated early retirement provisions&mdash;which I understand the opposition is supporting, although some speakers have had some reservations about it&mdash;the point about it is that it is an extremely limited platform. It is confined to officers who have completed 20 years service or more, have three years in their current rank, and have attained the rank of lieutenant colonel or above. So it is extremely limited and we believe it is needed in these times to make sure that the relatively limited number of senior positions that can be created are left there to be broadened and for the experience of grooming officers for promotion into the most senior ranks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will find that this is supported by the younger officers at senior levels&mdash;people of about my age&mdash;who have served in the military for some time. They have been in uniform for some time&mdash;as opposed to lengthy service in the uniform that we wear around this place&mdash;and they support this. They are making career decisions about whether they stay or whether they go. Promotion, and the increased opportunity that MIR will offer, will mean that the Defence Force will keep a lot more of its best and brightest people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Limited tenure appointments are needed for flexibility, particularly in areas of high speciality such as medicine and law, where we find it very hard to recruit and retain people. People on limited tenure appointments will fill a particular appointment at the rank of colonel or equivalent and above. It will be for a set period, which would normally be a minimum of three years, and on the basis that the officer would not otherwise have been promoted. This is a rational management tool for our human resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues we are confronting in the 1990s for the military, in terms of hardware, software technology, position in the region&mdash;in a foreign affairs sense&mdash;are all well on track. The hard work has been done. The money is coming through the system, and the work is being done well. The challenge is to continue to attract and retain the sorts of people we need to run our military systems. That will increasingly occupy more of the time of and require more effort from the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite would be aware of the Glenn review that will be on my desk, hopefully, by the end of July. That is the broadest, most wide-sweeping personnel policy review of the military ever undertaken. That review is similar to reviews of human resource policies undertaken in the private sector. Our aim with that review is to update our practices and to retain and attract the type of people we need for the 1990s and beyond. I suspect that the review will show that a lot of the things we are doing now in terms of human resource management in the military will have to be changed. We will not hesitate to do that. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a proposed amendment to the bill to insert a provision that will amend the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. Members may recall that in 1994 various amendments were made to that act in association with the introduction of the military compensation scheme, which I am sure members of both sides of the House regard as a great step forward for our serving people. One amendment provided an entitlement for compensation for an injury that arises from medical treatment provided at the Commonwealth's expense where that injury is an unintended consequence of the treatment. These things do not happen often, but when they do happen they can be pretty awful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that an unintentional effect of this amendment was that it did not cover the period between the enactment of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 1988 and the introduction of the military compensation scheme in 1994. This amendment which is being proposed by the government will fill the gap, so there is no period of defence related service to which the entitlement does not apply. It will enable us to address&mdash;hopefully, reasonably quickly&mdash;about 20 outstanding claims, which have an estimated cost of about $1 million although there will be considerable offsets in the avoidance of litigation. This is, unfortunately, one of the technical amendments that are needed to give legal auspices to a payment of moneys which is thoroughly deserved and warranted. A couple of the cases are particularly severe and I would urge the support of both sides of the House on the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is, obviously, no dispute on this side of the House that this amendment should be accepted. However, it is really quite ridiculous that the Department of Finance in this instance has not been prepared to follow a practice that has gone on for years. Where there has been a general intent demonstrated within legislation, and where there is demonstrable need for the payment not to have been made on a discretionary basis, the practice has been, through supplementary appropriations, for the funds to be disclosed as they should be and for the matter to be regularised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I do not know whether this situation is a product of the government running scared because of the proper Auditor-General's scrutiny of departmental expenditure, or whether it is some new fad within the Department of Finance, but it is quite regrettable that in this instance, as I understand it&mdash;the minister, quite properly, has not identified at least one of the cases involved&mdash;there has been inconvenience and some disquiet for the persons affected. That has occurred simply because of the failure of the Department of Finance to accept that there was an inhibition or restriction within the amendment to which he has referred, as first passed, and, consequently, an apparent ineligibility, although demonstrably there was responsibility by the Commonwealth for compensation to be paid to the persons affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that some commonsense be exercised within the Department of Finance in circumstances of this nature. The opposition believes that it is appropriate for this amendment to go through, but I would suggest to the officers within the Department of Finance that it would be far more appropriate&mdash;and certainly it would seem to me to be in the manner of common government obligation&mdash;that, instead of requiring a person to suffer until the amendment has gone through, the payment be made and subsequently appropriate legislative approval, if necessary, or supplementary appropriation funding be provided as has been the case in the past. In this instance I think it is regrettable that that commonsense was not used by the officers of the Department of Finance. </PARA>

The register will become the basis for the issue of equity in Wool International when it is eventually privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experience has shown the upkeep of the register involves the registration of a significant number of low value sales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the request of the Wool Council of Australia, other wool industry representatives and Wool International, the government has agreed to make provision in the act for the regulations to specify an amount for individual transactions below which Wool International would not be required to automatically register the transaction.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposed amendment to the Wool International Act 1993 relates to information held by Wool International on carpet wool-tax payers. The purpose of the amendment is to allow the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, AWRAP, to obtain access to the information held by Wool International on the taxpayer. AWRAP will require the consent of the carpet wool-tax payer to obtain the information, in the same way that information in respect of other wool-tax payers is obtained by AWRAP from Wool International. The information may only be used to determine eligibility to attend, and voting rights at, annual general meetings of AWRAP. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these is to remove the present requirement that AWRAP board meetings be held within Australia. The reason for the amendment is that the operations of AWRAP have been amalgamated with those of the International Wool Secretariat to provide a more focused wool promotion and research and development effort. The board of AWRAP has been appointed to the board of the International Wool Secretariat. There will be occasions where it is appropriate that the board of AWRAP meets overseas in conjunction with meetings of the International Wool Secretariat. Accordingly, the chairman of AWRAP has asked the government to remove the existing restriction on where board meetings may be held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposed amendment relates to the matching of payments made by the Commonwealth to AWRAP for research and development. At present, matching payments are not to exceed certain limits within the financial year. One of these limits is the amount paid to the organisation by way of income from the collections made under the wool tax acts for wool research and development. The effect of the amendment will be to allow the Commonwealth to match expenditure in subsequent years from tax collections where these are not all spent in the year of collection. The ceiling for the government's matching of expenditure in any one year will remain at 0.5 per cent of the gross value of shorn wool produced in Australia in the financial year.

The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is an omnibus bill which amends the way in which export inspection charges are imposed on certain fish exports to accord with industry wishes, which essentially relate to ensuring equity in the way in which AQIS charges are applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it removes the need to register the wool tax payments on very small amounts of wool. There are hobby farmers and others out there who occasionally remit very small amounts of wool and the recording costs for the relevant authorities are unnecessarily complex and time consuming, and it seems pointless to insist that they go on recording those very small amounts of wool when they are sold by individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, as the spokesman for the government has indicated, it provides a rollover of wool tax collected for research and development in one year to later years. I freely confess to having been a little concerned about that proposal when I first looked at it, but when we worked it through we came to the realisation that it was a perfectly reasonable thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, before I move on to some general comments about primary industry which I do want to make today, in relation to the change in the way in which export charges for AQIS inspections are levied, we currently have a situation where exporters pay AQIS a registration fee, they pay a direct service charge when an inspector is present and they pay $15 per tonne of fish exports. However, exports have been going through brokers who are in fact not charged the $15 a tonne. This legislation will ensure not only that that tonnage fee of $15 will come down to $10 from 1 July this year but that it is also paid by brokers and others who are currently avoiding payment. The industry has requested these changes, they are sound and they will ensure a greater degree of equity. We support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In broad terms, in relation to the wool industry, when that primary industry was restructured, with the full cooperation and input of the coalition, the government promised that Wool International would be privatised in 1997 and that growers who had paid wool tax for debt repayment between July 1993 and the date of privatisation, July 1997, would be given shares in Wool International, the privatised company, to follow the current statutory arrangement, according to their equity, and that equity was to be determined by calculating the amount of wool tax that growers had paid during that period. Wool tax, for the purposes of debt servicing and repayment, is set at a level of 4.5 per cent of sale price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry has been concerned for some time about the cost of having to register the name and address of every person who sells wool, many selling very small amounts. It has had a concern particularly in relation to those who sell less than perhaps $500 worth of wool a year. It might be the fellow out the back who has a few killers and shears them; it might be the fellow who has got a bit of wool left over in his shed from the days when he had sheep but no longer has them; it might be the hobby farmer from my area of Mudgee&mdash;whoever it happens to be, the cost of collecting and collating the information so that these people can take up their shares in Wool International really outweighs the benefits. Often they are hard to find, often they are people who sell wool once and may not sell it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be considerable expense involved in tracking small lots which might have come, as I say, from the shearing of just a few sheep on a hobby farm. The industry is quite happy that these people can, if they so desire, be registered for the purposes of establishing their eventual equity in Wool International, but it believes&mdash;and I think this is quite fair enough&mdash;that the onus ought to be on those people themselves to ensure that they supply the necessary details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to this bill make provision for the regulations to specify an amount below which Wool International will not be required to automatically register wool tax payments. However, it ought to be made perfectly plain that provision is made for any individual who sells a small amount of wool to ask Wool International, in writing, to register the payment, and that action will be acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some further amendments here which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Bevis) touched on. They provide, for example, that, where Wool International has details about a person who has paid wool tax imposed on carpet wool, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, AWRAP, may, with the consent of the person, request Wool International to allow AWRAP access to that information, or a copy of or an extract from that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister also mentioned, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 is to be amended to allow the board to meet outside Australia. For the reasons that the minister outlined, it is appropriate to allow that to happen with the amalgamation of AWRAP and the International Wool Secretariat. It is likely that from time to time it will be commercially and strategically prudent to meet in locations offshore from this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments bring the manner of paying research and development funds from the government for wool into line with the other research and development corporations by providing a rollover provision to ensure that the government matches dollar for dollar the amount contributed by woolgrowers for research and development up to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. We initially had some concerns about this because it appeared to us that if the industry did not spend all of the money contributed by the industry and the government for research and development in any given year the shortfall might be found missing the following year. But in fact it will not work that way. If there is a difference between what is contributed by growers and the amount actually spent on research, should the industry then spend that difference in the following year&mdash;the carryover, if you like, on research&mdash;then the government will match it. So we express our satisfaction with that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other broader comments I want to make. We have seen&mdash;and it is a source of great satisfaction to me and I dare say to the previous minister for primary industry, now the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean)&mdash;the substantial recovery of this nation's mighty wool industry. This is an enormous relief to Australians, or ought to be, because although I suspect that they pay very little attention to Australia's enormous trade deficit problem and although I suspect that many of them would take the view, perhaps technically correct, that we no longer in a sense ride on the sheep's back, the fact of the matter is that the wool industry is still a major export industry with enormous capacity for expansion in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry is one of the few industries that has the capacity to make a significant difference in a relatively short period of time to Australia's crippling export deficit problem. It is interesting to note that only one, so far as I am aware, major media outlet has recorded that the improved performance of the wool industry has prevented the current account deficit from being even worse than it has been in recent months. I commend that media organisation and point out that what it says is quite true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this place need to remember that some two-thirds of Australia's export earnings are still derived essentially from the efforts and the production of those who live in rural and regional Australia. In fact, despite the quite heroic contribution they make to the nation's wellbeing, their efforts are often under-acknowledged, not only in terms of public perceptions but in terms of the policy settings of this government. I want to place on record my basic optimism about the future prospect for Australia's rural industries. It is often said that primary industry is not as important as it used to be&mdash;it contributes only about four or five per cent of gross domestic product and about 25 per cent of our export earnings. That overlooks several very important factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For one thing, the reason that export earnings in many ways are at lower levels than they might otherwise be is that commodity prices are at low levels. As I will indicate in a moment, that is about to change. I think you will find that primary industry will have a significantly greater contribution to make to export earnings in coming years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing is one often not recognised when we constantly hear of Australia's improved manufacturing performance and the greater performance or contribution to export earnings that our manufacturing sector makes. That is usually said by people who either forget or do not understand that the major manufacturing sector in this country is the food value adding sector. In other words, the major manufacturing sector is dependent upon the primary industries to provide it with the raw materials that it needs to do its job and to employ hundreds of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very different views emerging on the future outlook for commodity prices and for derived value added product. In brief, they can be summarised by referring to the World Bank, which has recently put together a publication which argues that the world has become so flexible in its production of agricultural merchandise in its various forms that it is unlikely that there will be any substantial increase in real terms in prices for agriculture commodities over the next few decades. The essential position is that, should a shortfall develop in one aspect of the world's grain supplies, for example, production will be lifted or substitutes found for that shortfall in such a flexible and rapid fashion that there will be no particular push on prices such as there normally is on response to a supply shortfall.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a gloomy outlook for Australia's farmers and for the nation, which is still so heavily dependent upon export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is another view of world commodity prices emerging. It is put forward by people like the economist Lester Brown, of the Worldwatch Institute. He argues that such is the coming explosion in demand for agricultural product in Asia in general, in China in particular and so forth, that the emerging gap between supply and demand will be so great that for agricultural products we will see prices with which we are simply not familiar in our generation emerging in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The widely respected principal of Orange Agricultural College in New South Wales, John Chudleigh, takes a middle view. He argues very strongly, and I am sure he is right, that, given the problem with tightening world supplies of grain, emerging increasing demand in Asia and so forth, whilst we will not see the absolute explosion in prices&mdash;which could be quite dangerous&mdash;that the Lester Browns of this world talk of, we will see a significant improvement in agricultural prices. That is for the very simple reason that, in order to increase production to the levels that demand will likely dictate in the next few years, farmers in the Western world, particularly in this country, will simply have to receive a higher price for their product in order to justify the increased investment in their industries that will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very much the case, just as this country, under current Labor Party policies, has one of the oldest car fleets in the world, pumping out all sorts of nasty emissions from their exhausts. And when we ought to be encouraging more people to get into new cars, the government pushes up the sales tax on cars. That is pretty typical of their approach to encouraging investment in agriculture, and we now have a frighteningly ancient fleet of tractors and of agricultural implements across the nation, and it is reflected in the uptake of new technology. So higher levels of investment will be needed and that will only be made possible by higher prices received on farm for agriculture products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue, then, becomes whether the farm sector will be able to capture the benefits of improving commodity prices. I would have to say that the record of those in power at the moment would not lead you to believe that there was any great hope of that happening. And this is a very serious issue indeed for economic, social and environmental reasons. The environment is very important in this regard. The only way in which we are going to ensure that Australia's major environmental problems of land and soil degradation&mdash;and they are different things&mdash;and the attendant water quality problems, and so forth, are adequately tackled is to ensure that the nation's land-holders are in an economic position where they can do what they want to do&mdash;that is, to look after their land. Whether that is through contour banks, or more sophisticated rotations, or the uptake of modern farming technologies and what-have-you, farmers have to have adequate returns in order to restore past damage to Australia's agricultural lands and to move to sustainable production for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I come back to the question I posed earlier: what are the chances of farmers being able to snare enough of this sort of money that might flow from improved commodity prices and, hopefully, a breaking of the drought, in order to address these very real economic, social and environmental problems? The answer is that the signs are not at all promising, because the government cannot help itself&mdash;it will always tax an emerging, successful industry. I will give another example from the budget. One of the major problems we face in this country is transport&mdash;the tyranny of distance and all the rest of that. The government often tells us that our petrol is amongst the cheapest in the world. It never remembers to say that, by global standards, we tax our transport fuels at very high levels indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a particularly stupid thing to do because of the distances we have in this country. As I understand it, we tax diesel fuel more highly than the Americans, the Canadians and the South American countries&mdash;those that have vast distances to travel, like us, and are dependent on transport fuels to the degree that we are. But we also tax diesel fuel more highly than places like the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Japan. And what do they do with these transport costs? They continue to increase them; they continue to use transport as a milch cow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of last year, we had an unbelievable situation. We are the world's major global exporter of meat and we have the unbelievable situation where a potential importer of American beef can land the product in this country for less than we can produce the stuff ourselves. This is despite the fact that the Australian farmer produces for a great deal less&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4K4">Mr ANDERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they do. No-one has challenged the figures. It is about $5.80 here for American rump, compared to $6.20 for Australian product, and this is despite the fact that the Australian farmer gets very significantly less for his product in the first place than does the American. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) ought to have a good look at his own Industry Commission, because that is where the evidence is that this is the case. So how do they do it? Well, it is all about things like industrial relations, where the government refuses to move, where it leaves an obstructionist us-and-them approach locked into place. But it is also about taxation levels and cost structures forced on important parts of our infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason the Americans can land the product here so much more cheaply than we can is that in round terms the per kilometre tax, in our terminology, on a big truck taking that container of beef, or whatever it is, to the waterfront is about 10c a kilometre. In Australia, it is 27c a kilometre. That is getting on for three times the American level of tax on transport&mdash;on the rig, on the parts, on the tyres, on the fuel. You name it, it is there. What is the government doing in this area? The answer is short: fuel costs continue to rise and the sales tax on transport continues to rise. This is not sound economic and social management of the Australian community for the Australian community. It is, as one commentator observed in relation to the budget, short-term politicking at the expense of the long-term interests of Australia's working men and women and their families. It is also, of course, a major risk for Australia's primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am optimistic about the future but no farmer in this country nor anybody who is involved in rural industries&mdash;and there are vastly more of them than is generally acknowledged&mdash;should be deluded into believing anything other than that this government does not understand the need to ensure that primary industries are internationally competitive. That is a proposition that simply cannot be argued: there is no evidence to suggest that the government understands the need to make our primary industries genuinely, globally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The losers are not just our primary producers, they are the hundreds of thousands of Australian workers who are dependent on primary industries for their jobs&mdash;whether it is abattoir workers, fruit canning workers, transport workers, the wharfies themselves, or the people who work in Australia's scouring plants and top making plants, such as they are in this country. The fact of the matter is that they have a vested interest in securing the removal of a government that has no understanding and no commitment to genuine long-term reform. The government is only interested in short-term political gain. On that note, I conclude that we support these minor amendments before us today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) has to leave the chamber. We on this side of the House are very fond of the support that we are getting from the Deputy Leader of the National Party for these amendments. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill. Let me refer to a few of the deputy leader's arguments. This government is very proud of the restructuring that has taken place in the wool industry. There is no doubt that it was something that only this government could have achieved with the support of the wool industry. I am sure that the deputy leader is very much aware of the support that was given to Senator Bob Collins when he addressed the Wool Council in Adelaide the week before last. There is a positive feeling that the wool industry has recovered and that things look good. That is because of Wool International and because of the initiatives of the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and his successor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to digress, just as the Deputy Leader of the National Party did. It was claimed that this government is not supportive of the rural and regional sector of Australia. Another thing that this government is very proud of is that it is the largest representative of rural and regional Australia. There is no doubt about that. Have a look at the seats that we hold in rural and regional Australia: we do it very well. The reason that we are representative of such a large section of rural and regional Australia is that we get out there, we talk to the people and we make sure our policies reflect their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few comments were made about transport and transport infrastructure. It is very interesting to note in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the growth in the transport and storage infrastructure sector of Australia over the past 12 months has increased and that the investment in it has increased by 10.6 per cent. That is not insignificant and it reflects the confidence that this government is giving to the transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim was also made that rural and regional people are paying too much for their fuel. I am sure that all honourable members of this House are aware that, two years ago, when there was an increase in excise in fuel, the cost of petrol, in particular, was then about 75c a litre. I know that, around my electorate, most retailers of fuel sell petrol for considerably less than that today. Some two years later, the effective cost of fuel is less than it was. In regard to diesel, let me remind everyone that most diesel in this country is imported simply because our crude oil does not satisfy the needs of refineries to convert it into diesel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a government, we are continually being reminded that we must reduce our deficit. Diesel fuel is one of our big import costs. It is logical that such a commodity is carefully guarded by the government to ensure that we do not have further blow-outs. In relation to another rural commodity, our beef exports, I note that the government was being chided over the potential of American beef producers to bring their beef to Australia cheaper than local producers can supply the trade. I was in Japan last year and I was very proud of the fact that Aussie beef is on sale in most retail outlets in Japan. We are now the major providing nation of first class beef in Japan at a very reasonable price. That gives a return to our producers, and this is growing. Similarly, we are expanding on the Korean and the Taiwanese markets and others due to the ingenuity of Austrade and our primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I started by saying that this government is very proud of the relationship that it has with Australia's rural sector and the way it reflects the needs of rural producers. I conclude on that point. We have a record that is second to none. We have a record that has brought about change which will take our rural industry into the next century. We have done it well and I can assure people that we will continue to do it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise in support of this Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. I would like to address my remarks to the export side of the legislation. We do need inspection facilities for our exports but more importantly we need more exports. Australian exports have to grow and they will make a difference to the economic wellbeing of the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on one of the areas in primary industry which is now starting to use export opportunities, and that is the timber industry. The timber industry is a large industry in my area. It produces sawlog hardwood and pine plantation timbers and products. It converts hardwood and pinewood to pulp and it is produced into paper by the Amcor company, one of Australia's large paper producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware, along with a lot of other people, that development of this industry has been a  major concern to many people. It has been a hotly debated issue not only in relation to the environment but also in relation to the development of the industry itself and its move into export opportunities. It has also involved debate on products which should be processed in Australia as value added products before export. It has always been a major issue that Australia has for many years been a mine and that the country has lived off the sheep's back. Too often, our produce has gone overseas. This government has certainly put a lot of effort into making sure that we turn that around so that this country becomes a substantial manufacturer. We have certainly achieved that in the development of our economy since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to raise a few issues in the chamber today which are giving me grave concern in relation to the development of the timber industry and the potential of getting those exports. That includes the campaign that is being waged against the hardwood industry in Australia, a campaign which never seems to cease regardless of how much effort the government puts into the national forest policy statement and national policy negotiations. There are groups of people in this nation who believe that we should not harvest at all in our native forests and who are determined to continue campaigning down that path. They have every right to do so, and if their arguments can be sustained then governments will take them on board, but to this point in time certainly their arguments have not been sustained. Every report that has been produced for the government has indicated that we do have the capacity to have a native hardwood industry in our native forests, and it is certainly the policy of this Labor government to continue down that path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in the process, of course, of further development of forest agreements in order to eventually try to placate the opposition to these issues in this nation. To that end, there have been certain measures taken in order to try to bring on board all organisations in the industry and in the environment movement, to have them discuss rationally the issues and come to an agreed position. My concern is about the methods being used to do that and what is going on in the system at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government received a request from Environment Victoria, the new business name for the Conservation Council of Victoria, now operating under the state jurisdiction of an incorporated association rather than its former company operation under the Australian Securities Commission. It has taken a leading role in opposition to the hardwood industry and has been very, very active in trying to convince city people that the hardwood industry should cease. It has caused a fair bit of political agitation and the political campaign has probably had more substance than the ecological or the environmental productions that it has used to justify its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise in the Main Committee a concern I have with an action taken by the government through the minister for the environment. A study proposal was put to the government by Environment Victoria entitled `National plantations: environment, industry development and employment'. It was first submitted to the department of the environment in June 1993. Matching funding was sought at that time from the minister for resources and the minister for industry, technology and regional development. That was in February 1994. Both ministers chose not to provide any support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 May 1994, following receipt of a revised study proposal, the minister approved funding of $166,563 for this study. However, the decision was withheld, pending further action until late July and receipt of Environment Victoria's audited financial statement for the grants to voluntary conservation organisations program for 1993-94 and until questions that I had raised in the parliament on the extent of departmental funding to these organisations were answered. Following that work, the grant was made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understandable that governments will put grants out to organisations to develop work on their behalf on particular issues, but this is where my concerns start to really be raised. This report has gone to Environment Victoria, an organisation which has a very strong position in the field of opposing the hardwood industry. In a previous opportunity it was funded by the Victorian government to have a consultant produce a plantation report. The report, by Ms Judy Clarke, was found to be very poor in methodology, and a lot of the information provided in it was quite inaccurate. It was understandable because there was no discussion with industry. The report was done just from documents available in libraries and what have you, or public documents from newspapers, and therefore was not considered to be a sensible and rational report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with this $166,000 grant to Environment Victoria is that the same consultant has been employed&mdash;some seven months ago&mdash;and commissioned to do another plantation study. That is reasonable enough: the government is still probably within its rights to provide this money to this organisation to have a report done, and that report would be taken on board and assessed by the government in decision making in the future. However, to do the report, the consultant was also required to obtain information on all plantations in Australia&mdash;from the private sector as well as the public sector&mdash;and hence was encouraged to approach Amcor, one of the largest plantation operators in Australia, which operates the paper mill in my electorate. It was quite amenable to doing some work, if that was necessary, to provide its information, confidential information even, to the government in a properly constituted study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company then sought, of course, the terms of reference for the study, and I was approached as the local member to see what I could find. An approach to the minister's office clearly indicated, after many requests, that there were no terms of reference in relation to this study, that the only information that the minister had was a study proposal from Environment Victoria. On the request from this organisation, the money was allocated&mdash;not acquitted, but allocated as part of the budgetary process to have the work done that the organisation had put in its study proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has occurred since? With the approach from Amcor, a senior adviser in the minister's office saw fit to accompany the consultant from Environment Victoria and approach Amcor, very much raising the stakes of the credibility of this report, from something being done by Environment Victoria to the minister's office being heavily involved in seeking the information from Amcor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amcor was not prepared to respond, unless it had the terms of reference. With no terms of reference, it has failed to respond, and the information is not available to the consultant. We already know, from that information, that this study, when it is produced, will be very similar to the first one produced by this consultant in Victoria: it will be flawed, and very much so, possibly even in methodology, as well as lacking in the information that will be required for the report to have any substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is what is going to happen with this report. I have documentation of what Environment Victoria is doing in relation to this. It intends to use this Judith Clarke report as the mainstay and the catalyst for its campaign against the hardwood industry and to revive the environment issue on the front page of the newspapers before the next election. This government is funding this proposal to achieve this objective. </PARA>
<PARA>I am asking the government to seriously consider the position that it is placing the industry in and the serious position it is placing itself in, in relation to bringing forward these sort of funds to organisations whose intentions are not to provide the information sought by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wishes to have a national plantation study which includes private company involvement, then there are ways and means of doing that. The ways and means of doing that are to have terms of reference and to seek tenders from appropriate and qualified people to do the work so that the industry has the confidence to put that report together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are now, seven months into the process. A report, funded by the government, which is obviously very, very flawed from the beginning, because it cannot achieve its objectives, is set to be used as the catalyst for a major campaign against the hardwood industry and to get this issue back onto the front pages of our newspapers. Anyone can see how that is going to occur. Yesterday we saw the first breakthrough in getting on the media in relation to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>, following Peter Cook's interview after the discussion here in Canberra on the forest industry this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 10 minutes I would like to run through a few issues. A meeting report from Environment Victoria states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-Victorian marginal seats to be targeted are Jika Jika&mdash;Peter Staples . . . Clyde Holding's seat, Melbourne Ports . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This is an environment group, of course! It is not a political party, is it? The document continues:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-Judy Clarke's Plantation study report due for release on June 7th.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to say the release of the report will not be occurring next Wednesday because it is now deferred to 21 June. I hope that this government puts it aside, and puts it away completely, because it is not the way to go in relation to this. The date of the next forest summit that the group was working on was to be 17 June. It will be interesting to see whether it goes ahead now if it has not got Judith Clarke's report. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this Summit, greens, Democrats, Liberals and Young Liberals will be invited to put forward their forest policy for the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>In the industry area the group is talking about running a consumer campaign, to boycott companies which sell native forest hardwoods. The document states:</PARA>

<PARA>On that issue, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have seen the documentation of what is proposed. I put out a press release on 30 May which I would like to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor MHR for McMillan, Mr Barry Cunningham, has recently written to environmentalist groups across the country calling on them to cancel their plans for a major blockade of East Gippsland's hardwood timber industry which is predicted to occur on a massive scale in October this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cunningham said he had written to the leaders of all relevant organisations to express his concerns "at the direction taken by sections of the environment movement."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cunningham was first made aware of the blockade plans through a leaked document arising from a Canberra-based meeting of environmental groups earlier this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document outlined the blockade's objective as `disrupting resource security, undermining economic confidence and educating the workers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the letter he circulated this week Mr Cunningham said he was "genuinely concerned that this sort of situation, which has been shamelessly engineered by elements of the green movement, could result in a situation in which the safety of worker and protester alike could be placed in jeopardy."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"There are greater environmental issues in our world that are far too important to be sidetracked by an unnecessary campaign against the hardwood timber industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cunningham said he believed the blockade would only serve to create a needless confrontation between protesters and workers.</PARA>
<PARA>I am genuinely concerned about this issue. I am very concerned that the government has seen fit to give $166,000 to Environment Victoria. I am further concerned that this study is the only study that is proposed at this stage to be taken into consideration. I further call on the government to produce other studies on the plantation issue, which will include all plantations, before the community out there is given the impression that this Judy Clarke study is a government sponsored study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that one of the senior advisers to the minister has joined with the consultant to visit the private organisations to encourage them to participate in this study horrifies me. I believe it has created the situation where those people genuinely are saying, and will be able to say, that this is a government inspired and sponsored study. Away this campaign will go. There is no doubt that this study is crucial to the campaign, because I also have documentation here of the consumer boycott campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that the consumer boycott campaign could have four planks, targeting major builders, the public, timber outlets and architects. The suggested strategy is to approach major builders&mdash;maybe 50 around Australia&mdash;making the following points:</PARA>

<PARA>That is happening in the normal economics of the world at the present time anyway, but there is a place for both industries and this type of attack should be put to one side. Environment Victoria is making no bones about its position in relation to it. Yet another method reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An image to be designed which will link a piece of 4x2 hardwood timber to its effects on forest (bloody possums etc).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Use this constantly.</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen this campaigning before. We saw it start previously from a campaign project where this same consultant produced a plantation study, and we are about to see it happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is such that I could not keep quiet on this any longer. I have asked people to do something about it and nothing has happened. So I am prepared to go public in the parliament and call upon this parliament to put this study aside. It is flawed; it should not be allowed to be used as a catalyst for a fraudulent campaign; it should not be allowed to be used in the way these people intend to use it, in order to convince city people on an issue where they do not have a lot of knowledge. It is an emotional issue and the information being provided to them is emotional; the planning to use this is emotional; and it is causing tremendous problems in an industry in Australia. It is an industry where we are in position to move forward and to push offshore with $1.8 million worth of exports in timber and paper products that we can and should be producing in Australia with our own capital, our own product and our own workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I call on the government to get some alternative reports which have substance and are done by proper people. I call on the government, if it intends to do another one of these studies, to get some terms of reference, to do a tender project and to get somebody to do the job properly so that when the information goes out to the public we can all be assured and confident that the information being used is accurate and fair and has been sought from a proper base. The information should be available to everybody in Australia, not only to part of an environment group in Victoria calling itself Environment Victoria, which, at this stage, has been taken over by a group of radicals who are running the show in such a way that it is not doing the environment movement any good. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, you will be very interested to hear my comments about this particular report, given your participation in the Public Accounts Committee and in many other committees in the parliament as well. This is the 336th report from the Public Accounts Committee. It is titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. This is a very important subject and is something that we have a keen interest in. I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise and have a further discussion in this chamber. We tabled this report recently in the main chamber. In my tabling speech I outlined the principal findings of the committee's inquiry. In the report, the committee reached conclusions in a number of key areas and this afternoon I would like to give a brief overview of five of them before commenting on two other issues in greater detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The performance of public interest functions by commercial bodies and privatisation are the ones I wish to make further comment on, particularly the privatisation issue which is of interest at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal motivation behind the introduction of commercialisation of provision of goods and services to the public sector was the government's desire to increase the efficiency with which these services are provided. Evidence before the committee clearly shows that substantial gains in efficiency and effectiveness can be produced by commercialisation. We have all seen where that has been very effective. These gains stem from the administrative changes introduced by commercialisation and corporatisation and from the accompanying improvements made to the market environment. Competition is a pertinent force for bettering performance. We have all seen that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the most part, appropriate frameworks have been established for the operation and oversight of the Commonwealth GBEs and the government should be congratulated for that. These frameworks will be enhanced considerably by the passage of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 which is currently before the Senate. Honourable members will be well aware that the Public Accounts Committee is very keen to see that bill become law as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, however, business units and departments are more recent developments in the commercialisation spectrum, and that is what I would like to focus on at the moment. Consequently, they are not as well placed as GBEs to operate successfully on a fully commercial basis because they are quite clearly different. The framework for their operation is less well established and is still being developed in a lot of cases. The Department of Finance, of course, has a significant role in this process and, indeed, should be playing a more prominent role than it has to date in monitoring the problems that have arisen and in disseminating best practice through those various departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business units and departments are currently disadvantaged by the requirements imposed by being part of a department of state, and that is understandable because they have still got some of those shackles of a department on them. But, given that corporatisation provides increased flexibility of operation, the committee has recommended that successful business units should be corporatised. That is the next step, I believe, to make them the efficient and effective operations that I think we would want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both GBEs and business units need to have clearly defined and non-conflicting objectives. Although this principle is generally understood by the various organisations concerned, it was clear to the committee the principle has not always been fully translated into practice. Some examples which the committee identified were the Civil Aviation Authority, Auscript and Auslink. Confusion between the commercial and public policy objectives creates the risk of uncertainty in the minds of staff, clients and competitors with the likely outcome of reduced efficiency and productivity. Of course that is the main drive in producing efficiency and productivity in moving to the commercialisation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangement for ministerial oversight of all government businesses needs to be clearly stated and consistently applied. Although the committee concluded that at present there is no compelling evidence to support major change to the Commonwealth model of GBE oversight, the more centralised developments in other jurisdictions such as New Zealand and some Australian states were of considerable interest during the inquiry. The ongoing review and evaluation of developments such as these is a necessary pre-requisite to keeping the Commonwealth's own ministerial oversight and monitoring arrangements for GBEs relevant to changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a particular area of interest to the committee, as I mentioned. We had the opportunity to actually see how things operate in New Zealand. Certainly committee members took a very keen interest in that. We had some additional hearings with the public sector, but at the end of the day we were not convinced that the New Zealand model was the best one for Australia and were content to remain with the same conditions as we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other aspects I would like to talk briefly about as well before my colleagues take the opportunity to add to this relating to the public interest functions carried out by commercialised bodies and of course privatisation, as I mentioned earlier. The one area which I emphasised in my tabling speech was the need to safeguard the public interest functions that were once delivered by the predecessors of today's government businesses; in other words, by various government departments and agencies. The committee made a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring that community service obligations, better known as CSOs, and other public interest activities are identified, costed, funded and delivered appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee spent a lot of time on the examination of the special considerations applying to public interest functions delivered by GBEs and business units. In relation to business units the committee agreed with the Department of Administrative Services, DAS, when it stated that the definition of what should be seen as a function of the public sector rather than the private sector is constantly changing, and that is something I believe we need to continually monitor all the time. But an increasing trend over the last 10 years or so towards setting up commercialised business units, contracting out, corporatisation and privatisation provides ample proof of that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at public interest activities, the committee was keen to ensure that such functions are not abandoned in the face of commercial imperatives. All of us on the committee were mindful of the impact that CSOs have on particular members of the community, given that many of these CSOs relate particularly to rural and remote communities and to the less well off in our society. There is certainly a need for CSOs in our rural and remote areas. There is an impact on people living in those areas particularly, whether they be farmers on the land or Aboriginal people living in the various communities. Depending on how the CSOs are actually applied, people in those more remote and rural areas actually share the same benefits that Australians have across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognised the importance of ensuring that, when public sector agencies commercialise, universal access to these essential services is maintained. It is very hard to identify those CSOs because there are a lot of things that we tend to take for granted but we need to be able to clearly identify them. Prime examples of the essential services are Telstra's telephone service and the standard letter service provided by Australia Post. I would like to give Australia Post a pat on the back while I have the opportunity. In my observation, Australia Post is one of those extremely well-run Commonwealth GBEs. Australia Post provides a tremendous service and its representations to the committee indicated that. I think we can be very proud, as a nation, of the success story of Australia Post. It provides a universal service right across the country and it is one of the most efficient and effective Commonwealth GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further examples are provided by DAS and the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, AQIS, both of which are required by the government to clearly recognise public interest services as distinct elements of their business regimes. In 1993-94, DAS businesses received approximately $39.3 million to meet their CSOs. Similarly, AQIS received approximately $50 million in its 1993-94 budget allocation to provide CSOs such as meat inspection services and barrier control functions for quarantine purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has therefore made a number of recommendations designed to ensure that public interest activities are continually reviewed, and appropriately costed and funded during the move towards commercialisation in the Commonwealth public sector. The committee also saw a greater role for community groups than exists at the present time in defining and monitoring the delivery of CSOs. We felt that community groups needed to have a bigger say and have an input into what CSOs are, how they can be best identified and how they can be funded. For this to work effectively, there needs to be better information about the goods and services provided than is currently available: for example, the standards of CSO delivery, such as those which have been published by Australia Post and Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the committee recommended that, contrary to current practice, the Commonwealth Auditor-General should monitor the operation of the CSO system by carrying out performance audits on GBEs with public interest obligations. Once again, we are trying to identify&mdash;in case anyone gets confused about it&mdash;the CSO area that the Auditor-General needs to identify, particularly where services are delivered by GBEs. At the present time, the Auditor-General does not have the right to do performance audits on GBEs. It is a particular area that needs to be emphasised and I hope the government will give it fair consideration as it is a valid point. If we want to assist our people in the rural areas, we need to make sure that our CSOs are effective. I should have mentioned that CSOs are not restricted to rural areas. They are in our urban areas and they are often not identified enough there either. It is something that we should focus on in order to ensure that all Australians share, on an equitable basis, the wealth of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to an interesting subject which I am sure my colleague the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) will want to focus on later. It concerns the question of privatisation. I am sure he, and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) will add something to it later. The many interesting issues which emerged during the inquiry included the whole question of privatisation and Professor Hilmer's report on competition that my colleague has just alluded to. The related question of whether the government should be involved in businesses at all is one that often comes up. The member for Lyne was one of the main people to contribute to the name of our report: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. I think it is a very good title and I thank him for his contribution towards that. He also added something to the substance of the report, I have to admit. He did not just have something to say about the front cover. I am sure he will pick me up on that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, the government has sold a number of GBEs. The program of asset sales has been based on considerations of whether the public interest is still best served by the government actually owning these businesses. As well, as we all know, the budget contains plans for selling the government's remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank, in two stages, by 1997-98. The committee believes that the government's commitment to continuing examination of its direct involvement in businesses is appropriate. It is, of course, because things change, circumstances change, affecting whether a government needs to be particularly involved in a business or not. When there is an area in the community where there is a shortfall, where the private sector is not providing the services that are needed, then I think that government obviously needs to step in and get those businesses up and running. But then, over a period of time, when it clearly no longer needs to be involved and when the private sector or other community elements pick up those areas, there is no real need for the government to remain involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is definitely an argument on both sides: there are cases where the government needs to be involved in business, and there are others where it probably needs to decide to opt out of it. But that is something that needs to be kept under constant review to ensure that the Australian taxpayer's dollar is spent in the best way and that the services the Commonwealth provides are pushed through in the best way to the end users. I do not think it is just a matter of flogging things off for the sake of flogging them off. It is more a case of assessing whether there is a real need for the government to remain involved in a particular area. Are the services being provided by the private sector just as efficient or effective? Or is there a need for the Commonwealth to remain involved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, some of the media commentators, notably the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, were not exactly very kind to us about our report. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, from your own involvement in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, it is without doubt the most effective committee in the parliament. All the members, to their great credit, work very effectively together. We ensure that we work very much on a bipartisan basis to bring through the best results that we believe can flow on to the Australian people through the government adopting our recommendations. The fact that a lot of the recommendations from our report on the Taxation Office have been accepted by the government has clearly shown the good work that this committee does. That is not taking anything away from other committees of the parliament. The committees are a very effective means for members of parliament to make a contribution and should be well supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pick up on what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> had to say, it suggested the committee had actually squibbed on this issue of privatisation. I suggest that we certainly did not. It was an area that had to be canvassed and was well canvassed. The points I have already made this afternoon indicate the sorts of feelings that are coming through from our members on the need to consider that question. As I say, it is not just a matter of deciding whether to flog things off or not. It is a matter of using a bit of commonsense and really assessing the role of government in public enterprises. I think that is more the point. We took a very serious approach to this question and certainly did not come up with anything that would suggest that the committee squibbed or anything like that. The committee made it perfectly clear that the retention of public ownership in a commercial enterprise is a matter for continuing review and for assessment on a case by case basis. That is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our assessment, there are a number of roles which the committee identified as being appropriate for the government vis-a-vis business activities and I will run through these particular points. They include: providing services that are not available from the private sector; fostering emerging markets, but withdrawing from them as the private sector develops sufficiently to compete effectively; facilitating the private sector's work through joint ventures, export enhancement and technology transfers&mdash;that is very important; monitoring and regulating, except where the government businesses compete with the private sector; and developing appropriate policies for Australian businesses to flourish. That is an important part&mdash;to ensure that Australian businesses actually do flourish. In a lot of areas, a lot of our GBEs are very successful. One, of course, is Telstra, which has now moved very much into the international market. That is a great thing for Australia in terms of expanding our export opportunities in the goods and services area, the technology that goes with it, and the great benefits that we can provide, particularly to our region where Telstra plays a very important part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To carry out these tasks, the government requires access to well-honed expertise which, in many cases, is maintained by ongoing involvement in business. Whilst some of the necessary expertise may be available from private sector consultants, this may not always be so. In addition, it is necessary to have a sufficient number of skilled people in-house to monitor the quality of the work carried out by consultants, to assess the significance, and to encourage a degree of consistency in the approach taken by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judging the appropriate level of direct involvement that the government should have in business is difficult and, of course, is subject to change over time. That is the important part, as I mentioned earlier. Each case should be looked at on its merits. There is no one model which can be applied either universally or without periodic review. It is important for us to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, I pay tribute to the sterling efforts of all the committee members, and certainly the member for Lyne and the member for Corinella who are here today, and our deputy, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), who certainly made a fine contribution. I also pay tribute to the staff of the committee who worked extremely hard and put in a tremendous effort in ensuring that the papers were well prepared for us. The advice we get from them is always first class and very professional. This is a good opportunity to give them the acknowledgment that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bipartisan spirit with which my colleagues worked on this was important in bringing out the best of the various aspects of this report. I hope that members of the House will read it. I look forward to a positive response from the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I probably will not speak for as long as the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) did on the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. However, it is important that we have had the opportunity to bring this motion from the main chamber to the Main Committee room so that we can express more extensively our views on what was a very extensive and important inquiry as far as the future of public policy in Australia is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Oxley, alluded to, there was a great spirit of bipartisanship during most of the inquiry and in terms of the recommendations that are contained in this report. I had the opportunity to speak briefly on this when the report was tabled in the House in budget week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of important elements arising from this report need to be noted. Firstly, I will take responsibility for the title, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. The member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) and I were in competition as to whose name for the report was going to get up, and in the end my title was used because public business in the public interest is what the report is basically about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry started when I first came into this place a couple of years ago. It was set up to look at the effectiveness, efficiency and appropriateness of the commercialisation of government business enterprises. It has been an interesting inquiry in that we have been able to have a look at the process that government departments have been through in developing strategies for change. Some of the GBEs that have moved away from being line agencies have undergone a major metamorphosis. They have moved into operating as a private sector enterprise, but they are still a government business enterprise, where the Commonwealth government is the shareholder, with the portfolio minister carrying that responsibility, as well as his responsibility as far as policy over that area is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the points I want to touch on this afternoon. I do not think the point can be laboured too much&mdash;and it was also mentioned by the member for Oxley&mdash;that it is important to recognise the existence and the continuation of community service obligations in these areas. I do not think anybody on either side of this chamber will argue about the fact that on both sides of politics we are rapidly moving down the path of the corporatisation and commercialisation process and, ultimately, on to privatisation&mdash;for whatever reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason given by the member for Corinella will be different from mine and different from the reason given by the member for Oxley. The important thing is that these sorts of inquiries are in place and that the evidence contained in these reports be used as reference documents as we go through that process. Regardless of whether it is a Labor government or a coalition government, the process will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corinella will have a different reason from me, as will the honourable member for Oxley, but the important thing is that we have these sorts of inquiries in place. The evidence contained in these reports will be used as reference documents as we go through that process. Regardless of whether it is a Labor government or a coalition government, the process will continue, as we have seen recently in the budget. I am sure it was a great surprise to a lot of the left-wing members of the Labor Party to hear about the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. But if the process is put in place properly it is certainly nothing to be frightened of&mdash;and you would agree with me there, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the elements of this report address those issues. A very fundamental issue, particularly as far as regional Australia is concerned, are the community service obligations. We do not have to have a publicly owned body providing CSOs, provided the portfolio minister can clearly identify the CSOs that the government of the day wants to provide. They should be costed. They should be put on line in the budget and kept separate in the accounting structure as far as the GBEs are concerned or the privatised body is concerned. In that way we can maintain the provision of that CSO to the community. As you and I are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, given the electorates that we represent, CSOs are very important, particularly as they relate to Australia Post and Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were some very important and interesting recommendations in this report with regard to CSOs. Recommendation 11 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In identifying new community service obligations, the Department of Finance, in conjunction with relevant government business enterprises and portfolio departments, should:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)seek and consider input from relevant community groups and interested parties; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)analyse the proposed new community service obligations in the light of the Government's broad social justice policy objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very important in getting as much input as possible from the community. If in the process of corporatisation and commercialisation a lot of that consultation work was done at length at an early stage, it will certainly eliminate a lot of the disputation later on in the process. We cannot highlight enough the importance of clearly identifying those CSOs. It is going to be a matter of government policy, whoever is the government of the day, as to the extent those CSOs go to. In recommendation 13 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before the future of the airports currently operated by the Federal Airports Corporation is settled&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and the government has budgeted to sell these about three years in a row&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Departments of Transport and Finance should:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)identify and assess any `implicit' community service obligations in the operations of the airports; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)agree on appropriate methods for the future delivery and funding of the community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>This is incredibly important to both you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, in that we have regional airlines operating out of our electorates into KSA in Sydney. Honourable members will recall that the Prices Surveillance Authority had a look at the charging structure of the FAC and said that there should not be cross-subsidisation between the aviation activities and the commercial operations, the shops and the like and the lessees in the building, because they make a big profit there, and they then cross-subsidise the avionics. It means that landing charges, particularly during shoulder periods, are much more affordable to those regional airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We got quite a fright at one stage when we were looking at paying a lot more for airline tickets between our areas in regional New South Wales into KSA if we wanted to land in a shoulder period. At the moment, that seems to have slipped off the agenda a little whilst the main game is focusing on the privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must be extremely vigilant towards that. Along with my colleague the honourable member for Corinella, the maintenance of those community service obligations is an aspect of this report that is dear to our hearts. They can be provided regardless of whether that entity is a line agency, whether it is a government business enterprise operating in a corporate form or whether it ends up getting privatised. They can still be provided if government identifies what it is that it wants to provide and they provide the funding directly from budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting aspect that the honourable member for Oxley touched on with CSOs is that we have recommended in recommendation 18:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Finance should consider whether to recommend amending the Auditor-General Bill 1994&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is before the other place at the moment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of the community service obligations of government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>That is intended to enable the government to maintain a handle on what is going on there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our recommendations in another report was with regard to the Auditor-General having access to performance audits on GBEs. I do not want to labour the point too much, but a very important element of that is that, although the portfolio minister is the shareholder, the taxpayers of Australia own the business. The Auditor-General is our watchdog. This parliament should have a right for our watchdog to be able to report back to us what that GBE is doing. Presently, he cannot do that. As I say, that is the subject of another recommendation in another bill that is being kicked around in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, during the process of the inquiry some members of the committee had the opportunity to go and have a look at the New Zealand model. Unfortunately, I was not one of them. In New Zealand, with GBEs, the portfolio minister is not the responsible shareholding minister. They have a minister for GBEs or whatever they call them in New Zealand&mdash;government trading enterprises or government business enterprises. That was discussed at length. There was not a clear recommendation made in the report in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have a very firm belief that they should be separated. That was evidenced in my mind in the problems that arose last year and at the beginning of this year with the Civil Aviation Authority. I congratulate the government and the minister for making the decision to separate the responsibilities of the CAA between air traffic control and safety regulation. The CAA, in operating as a government business enterprise, was operating directly under the control of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) who, as the portfolio minister, had responsibility for setting policy while also extracting the profit from his GBE. In that regard, there is a conflict of interest. When it comes to the safety of the travelling public of Australia, it is very important that that be identified and highlighted. At the moment, those activities are being separated and, quite frankly, safety regulations should be brought right back under the control of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let air traffic control be a commercial enterprise and a money making objective for the GBE. The question that will be asked continually is whether it is a good aspect of public policy to maintain a portfolio minister who is setting policy over a GBE and the way they operate, while also being the shareholding minister for the government and wanting to get his dividend out of the GBE. A future government may address that aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the interest that this particular report has created, not just within the Commonwealth of Australia but also overseas. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to participate in a political exchange program to the United Kingdom. The people that we had the opportunity to speak to in this area of government in the United Kingdom were very interested in what we were doing with report 336 and the recommendations contained therein. The British auditor-general visited Australia last year. Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to speak with him when he was out here, but I did go and visit his office in the UK. They were very interested in what Australia was doing as far as this sort of financial management is concerned and the path that we are going down. We would all agree that the Thatcherites made a number of mistakes&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague from the Left agrees. They made a number of mistakes, not about what they significantly privatised but about the pace at which they ran it. They just jumped into government and said, `Right, we're going to privatise all these things. There's no need for these bodies to remain in public ownership.' They were privatised without any regulatory framework being established to control them. Now the British government has not got control of them and it is in all sorts of strife trying to enact legislation to regulate the activities of what are now private enterprises that provide a monopoly service, previously having been a government activity providing a monopoly service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we pursued this inquiry, the process should be to take it from a line agency to a government business enterprise, give it a corporate structure and have it operating commercially so that it is operating in the same ilk as any other corporation out in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that point, if the government of the day believes that a GBE is not necessarily meant to stay in the public ownership, it could be sold. But before selling it, if it is providing a monopoly service, all the government has to do is identify the CSOs and create the regulations to control what it is doing. It has done it as far as Telstra and Optus are concerned and, heaven forbid, if we end up with another Labor government after the next election, Telstra might be sold next. It would be interesting to see how the Left performs then, because it did not have much to say about the Commonwealth Bank out in the public arena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What can I say regarding some of the comments of the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile)? There is much that is left unsaid in just a few words in this House against what occurred at many of those committee meetings. We are here today to take note of report 336 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. I have already spoken on this matter once in the House and so I will not take too much of the committee's time in making some further comments on this report. I think it is a good report and it forms the basis for the consideration of government action in the years to come. It addresses some of the key issues which relate to the whole question of commercialisation and that movement within government and within the parties on both sides of the House towards changes in the operation of government business enterprises. As a basis for further consideration of change that may occur, it is well worth a good hard look.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate first on the question of community service obligations. There are about 33 recommendations in the report, and around one-third of those recommendations relate to community service obligations and questions of the public interest. What came through clearly in the evidence that the committee took and the submissions that it received is that this is a key issue with respect to the operation of government business enterprises as they move from a more traditional Public Service environment into a more competitive environment, and we need to look at the whole question of what happens to those community service interests and whether they are maintained and how that in fact is addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One concern which came up in some of the evidence we received was that, as some enterprises became more commercially oriented, perhaps the community service obligations were being eroded. That was a real concern to many members of the committee. Also what came through is that there is sometimes confusion about what a community service obligation actually is and how far it should go. Many of these things have, if you like, evolved but have not been clearly defined, and the definition is a key aspect of ensuring that accountability occurs and that relevant comparison and relevant surveillance can occur in the meeting of those obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said in the report that there needs to be clarity in the consideration of community service obligations and a situation where they are clearly identified and defined. There needs to be, if not broad agreement on what they are to be, certainly a broad understanding of what they are meant to be. If that is changed, that is an issue of policy. It is an issue that any government should be accountable for and judged on accordingly, but it has to be in circumstances where those things are clear. That is a very important issue in rural Australia, to low income earners and a range of other elements which make up today's Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly believe that there needs to be that clarity, and we need to have, if you like, watchdogs which go beyond even the Auditor-General in many industries to ensure that those CSOs are monitored properly and accountably. There needs to be a greater support network for community groups in considering the operation of community service obligations. There need to be, where possible, budget outcomes for community service obligations. They need to be clearly costed and well defined, and all of that needs to be part of what is on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in its considerations, the committee found that there are some issues and that there are some occasions on which it may well be difficult to clearly define community service obligations or to cost them and to put them in a budget scenario. Australia Post is the clearest example where that is raised. The question of cross-subsidisation, which occurs with respect to many Australia Post services, may well be an issue which will not lend itself to a clear budget costing, but where the community service obligation remains a key aspect of government policy, and, in many respects, a bipartisan policy position. Any erosion which may occur in areas such as Australia Post has to be watched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the budget outcome approach and the clear costing of CSOs is a desirable outcome on many occasions, on some occasions it may not be applicable and, therefore, there may be other approaches that need to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) has already mentioned the question of the separation of regulatory and business functions, and he uses the example of the CAA. That is a very important issue with respect to the operation of services that may have a regulatory role as well as an actual corporate business interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that, most certainly, those regulatory versus business functions should be separated, which follows on from the argument and debate around the question of community service obligations. It is possible, in a situation where the business bottom line is the ultimate goal, that you can have an erosion occurring around not only community service obligations but also regulatory functions. That is a real danger, and it is something that the government should be looking to avoid wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne also referred to the question of the Hilmer report, which is the subject of some debate within the committee; a debate which is often between myself and everybody else, I might add. Nonetheless, it is an issue that raises some real concerns with respect to the operation of commercialisation. On the question of the Hilmer report, I do not oppose competition policy as such; my concern is the operation of competition policy with respect to the real world. Getting competition through as a role to improve the operation of business entities is not a bad thing. The danger is that it is used as an excuse for a range of other activities, whether it be privatisation or other issues that have been canvassed over time on the question of the Hilmer report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue which relates to the Hilmer report attracted some comment in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 12 May 1995 in an article to which the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) refers. Quoting from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on the question of the report of the committee, the journalist, David Shires, said that the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . squibbed on the hard question of whether government should be running businesses.</PARA>
<PARA>I have a fair bit of respect for David Shires in terms of his comment, but, on this occasion and with respect to that particular issue, he is a bit harsh on the committee. We did not squib on the hard question of whether the government should be running businesses; we found that there is not an easy answer to the question. Essentially, doctrinaire approaches with respect to the operation of government in the business environment are not appropriate. There are times and there are circumstances when government should be involved in business, but it should be viewed on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee said that it depends on the circumstances and that there is certainly a role for government in business if it is providing a service that the private sector is unwilling or unable to provide and where there may well be a need for a form of competition from government with respect to private sector involvement. The committee also said that, on some occasions, there will be a strategic need for government to remain involved within a particular business environment for the sake of the country. There is a range of examples on that basis, but, essentially, any case should be viewed with respect to those particular points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of government in business is something that can occur on wider occasions, and we should not necessarily be saying, `Let's get out,' wherever there is private sector involvement. I do not think that that is necessarily good for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the other recommendations of the report relate to the question of the operation of and the process around commercialisation. Essentially, what came through from the hearings and from the submissions is that there is a need for development of best practice with respect to the procedure by which organisations proceed with the process of commercialisation. There are some very good examples of how this process has been carried out effectively, and, to some extent, there are some very bad examples. There needs to be a greater hands-on role in terms of developing processes and in terms of producing a handbook on how to achieve this process through the Department of Finance and through the Department of Administrative Services. There are lessons that can and should be learned so as to ensure that the commercialisation of business enterprises is carried out in the most effective and efficient way possible and so that the most desirable end result is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect that came through from that was the question of a loss of skills. That is a real concern with respect to the movement in this process. Quite often, in the movement to commercialisation, there will be a downsizing of organisations and often a loss of staff. One thing that came through was that often departments and business units lost their best staff through that process. That was very unfortunate in the actual business operation, post-commercialisation, and was also a real concern with respect to expertise within the government and departments, in terms of particular specialised areas. I know from discussions that I had with representatives from the metalworkers union that this was a real concern within the Department of Defence. That skill loss that they believed was occurring, and could show was occurring, was impacting on the results within Defence in terms of their tendering processes and in terms of the need to have expertise within the department to ensure that the results of tenders were the best for the government and the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that the committee addressed was the need to support Australian industry wherever possible and wherever it was sensible. With respect to the operation of commercialised business entities, there was evidence to show that on occasions, when commercialisation had occurred, there became, if you like, a view that buying Australian was not really the way to go. It was not their version of best practice. But often these decisions were taken without considering whether there were good Australian alternatives. This is an overall problem which the member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) highlighted in his report on government purchasing. I think it is an important issue. Where possible, Australian industry should be utilised so that we do not have an unnecessary level of imports and so that we can have a situation where Australian government supports Australian industry and helps provide Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the report provides a reference point for further activity in this area. It is an area which will continue to be of interest to government because there are still more aspects of government that will move down this track in the years to come. I think it provides a reasonable guide when looking at and considering those issues and in terms of getting the best possible result from these changes that occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the staff of the committee. They were tireless in their efforts to assist the committee members, in providing us with good quality information and in assisting in the construction of the report. They also went through the many hours of deliberations over the report in order to finalise what I think is a very important document for public administration in this country. I also thank the committee members from both sides of the House. It was a constructive process. It was a very long one but, as I said, a very effective one in the end. I commend the report to the House. It is a document that can play a good role in the development of policy for government for many years to come. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Under the apparatus licence fees structure introduced by the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) amateur licence fees are $51 as of 3 April 1995. Under the previous fees structure the fee was $37.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It is not possible to provide the specific information requested by the honourable member, as that information is not kept by the ATO. Legal action to recover a debt, which can result in the bankruptcy of a debtor, is commenced in quite a number of cases. However, that action may not always be pursued to its ultimate conclusion because the debtor may pay in full or may enter into an acceptable arrangement to pay a debt over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also cases where other creditors of the ATO debtor may pursue a debt to bankruptcy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner has provided the following information in relation to cases subject to insolvency action (that is, corporate liquidation and individual bankruptcies) at 30 June for each of the three years in question: (a) at 30 June 1992, the ATO had 15,819 insolvency cases on hand; (b) at 30 June 1993, the ATO had 11,534 insolvency cases on hand; (c) at 30 June 1994, the ATO had 10,079 insolvency cases on hand.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The ATO takes all possible action to recover outstanding tax debts. The Commissioner expects taxpayers (including corporates) to arrange their affairs so that they can meet their liabilities when they fall due for payment. If a tax debt is not paid by the due date for payment and the debtor does not contact the ATO, the Commissioner can only make the assumption the debtor is not going to pay and put in place action to deal with that debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That action may include personal, telephone or written contact, the issue of garnishee notices, the issue of orders preventing a debtor's departure from Australia until a debt is paid, legal action up to and including the bankruptcy of an individual or the liquidation of a company, accepting payment of the debt over time, recovering from the personal assets of company directors, writing-off debts considered uneconomical to pursue and inviting applications for a release, which are determined by a Taxation Relief Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bankruptcy (or liquidation in the case of corporates) is the ultimate sanction for debtors who do not enter into arrangements with their creditors to pay outstanding debts. Once debtors are made bankrupt, their financial affairs are placed in the hands of the official receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy who has a responsibility to act for the benefit of all creditors. Generally, taxation debts are unsecured and the Commissioner is treated the same as any other unsecured creditor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bankruptcy Act provides the official receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy with the appropriate resources necessary to claw back assets that are held by bankrupts and to make those assets available to creditors. Amendments to the Act in 1991 gave trustees significant power to overturn distributions of property which were intended to defraud creditors or payments by the bankrupt which favoured one creditor over another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remedies for creditors are restricted by bankruptcy. Generally, the right of creditors to enforce an individual remedy against a bankrupt personally or against the bankrupt's property is replaced with the right of claiming against the bankrupt's estate. A claim against a bankrupt's estate is made through the official receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy by lodging a proof of debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a)-(c) The Commissioner cannot publicly disclose details of Mr Bond's, or any other taxpayer's, taxation affairs. Nevertheless, it is a matter of public record that Mr Bond was an undischarged bankrupt who owed an amount of tax when he sought to have his bankruptcy annulled by putting forward a scheme or composition to his creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cases where a bankrupt has not put forward a scheme or composition, creditors will only receive whatever dividend is declared by the official receiver or trustee in bankruptcy. If a scheme or composition is accepted by a majority of creditors (in number and value&mdash;the vote of the majority binds all creditors), all any creditor can expect to receive by way of dividend is the dividend proposed in the scheme or composition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A creditor cannot expect to receive any more than the amount declared as a final dividend by the official receiver or trustee in bankruptcy in respect of a debt for which a proof of debt has been lodged. Similarly, no creditor can expect to receive any more than the proposed dividend under the scheme or composition accepted by a majority of creditors. In either case, the remaining balance of a debt is irrecoverable at law and would be written-off.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr Gear</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 provides two types of sales tax exemptions for motor vehicles. First, there is a restricted exemption for certain types of four wheel drive vehicles used mainly in carrying out activities in the agricultural industry. Secondly, there is a sales tax exemption available to registered taxpayers for general purpose road vehicles (including two wheel drives) used exclusively within production premises (owned or leased by the taxpayer) or used between adjacent production premises, or both. Both types of exemptions are available to subcontractors in specific circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption covering four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry is restricted to persons carrying out activities that are agricultural in nature such as cultivation of the soil and harvesting, but not to activities of a general purpose nature, such as fencing, bore sinking, earth moving or kangaroo shooting. This exemption is unique to the agricultural industry and represents an acceptance of the special needs of agriculturalists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption for general purpose passenger motor vehicles for subcontractors to goods producers, including primary producers, applies to a wider range of vehicles than the exemption for four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry. However, it is restricted to vehicles used exclusively within premises, owned or leased by the goods producer, or in going between adjacent premises of the goods producer. This exclusive use restriction would prevent kangaroo shooters subcontracting to primary producers from obtaining exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Sales Tax is a self assessing tax. Taxpayers assess their liability according to the transactions that have occurred in a specific period and submit the tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Details are not available of specific transactions involving kangaroo shooters.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that in general, terrain obstacles do not require marking or lights unless an aeronautical study determines that the obstacle requires a hazard beacon to ensure the safety of air navigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where marking of terrain obstacles at night is necessary, the CAA's practice is to require the terrain to be marked by a hazard beacon in the form of an occulting red light.
