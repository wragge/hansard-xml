One of the evaluation group recommendations is likely to be that public access to parliamentary materials be provided through public libraries and community information networks to individuals via the Internet. This is a global network of databases and information sources. The evaluation group has proposed that, before a final decision on the use of the Internet is made, it should be tried for a period of six months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hawke-Keating government's phased reductions in tariffs was, and still is, not accompanied by any reduction in imposed costs on our manufacturers. This includes the high costs of utilities, freight and transport. Micro-economic reform is an issue that this government has talked about for many years. We have encouraged the government to address this issue time and time again in this place, but it still remains on the books as an item to be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the newspaper this morning a report that our wharves, the heart of our transport system exporting goods from this country, are decreasing in efficiency, notwithstanding the fact that this government has spent over $350 million of taxpayers' funds and that industry has spent a comparable amount in order to reform work practices on the wharves and to help make us competitive. The reports in today's press indicate that, instead of our position improving worldwide, the position of our wharves is getting worse. Container ships are in our ports longer and longer. That imposes costs on industry. It means that our costs of shipping from Australia to other countries are greater than what they ought to be. It means that we are less competitive in the international marketplace. It is just one more major item associated with the massive demise of our manufacturing industry in Australia that this government needs to be called to task for. The demise of manufacturing is the major point I wish to raise in my contribution to this debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, while the government has been quietly reducing tariffs&mdash;I congratulate it for this position&mdash;it has made no changes to and no major structural reform of our industrial relations system. We talk about tariffs as being an item of protection. Tariffs are protection: they protect local manufacturers against the efficiencies and cost effectiveness of manufacturers from other countries. But our industrial relations system acts to protect workers from their bosses, supposedly, or from their own desires. In effect, we have third parties determining what ought to be matters of negotiation and resolution between workers and the people that they work with and for. In this way, companies and their employees can reach solutions about how they are paid that allows the work force to be well paid, that allows them to become part of the operation and that allows them to become part of the business and to feel that they have ownership in the business and pride in their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is not dedicated to the reform of employee relations. It was dedicated to reducing tariffs to try to make industry more competitive. Industry has been made more competitive but, at the same time, we have wiped out so much of our manufacturing industry that we are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that for a long time now we have been well and truly out of the major recession brought about by this government, yet we still have unemployment at high, structurally unacceptable  levels.  Over  800,000 Australians still do not have work. In recent times, many of those people who have found work have taken the opportunity of securing part-time employment or casual employment as they are unable to find full-time jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that much of this problem of our long-term unemployment can be sheeted home to the fact that we no longer manufacture enough of those goods which Australians require and desire to purchase. So as we come out of recession, as people start to open up their pocketbooks and feel confident in the economy once again and they go out to buy whatever it is they want to buy, we find that we are sucking in imports to satisfy that demand rather than manufacturing those products on the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect it is clear that in recent months we have seen a dramatic increase in Australia's exports of radically transformed manufactured goods. But, at the same time, we have seen not only a corresponding but a greater increase in imports of manufactured goods. We now have a deficit in manufactured goods of $35 billion a year&mdash;and we are supposed to make that up with increases in services and increases in commodities. So, after 12 long, hard years of Labor, Australia is still dependent on its commodities to satisfy its standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a government today which is examining increasing interest rates still further to try to depress demand, increasing taxes to try to offset to some extent its negative balance of payments problem and, at our insistence again and again, talking finally about decreasing government spending. We have been living on the bankcard for a long time but we have this huge structural problem&mdash;and it is a structural problem. It is not a problem of interest rates. It is not a problem of our taxes being too low. Our problem is the fact that we do not manufacture enough of those things that we want and we do not do enough other things to offset the huge deficit in manufactured goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had a balanced economy we could ride through a number of these problems from other countries which affect us from time to time. As interest rates rise and wane, we follow absolutely because our international debt is so high that we have no option but to try all sorts of governmental artificial measures to solve what is, in effect, a real structural problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This hardcore floor of unemployment is today higher than it was at the end of the last recession, which was higher than it was at the end of the recession before that. If this government is not very careful as it adjusts its economic policy in the next few months as we come to the next budget, it might bring on another recession. Then we will find that unemployment blows out up into the teens&mdash;and Australians cannot afford that. Australians want to work. Australians are hard workers and dedicated to employment and we need Australians, desperately, in employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our real problem is that we need to manufacture more. So we need a government which has a vision, which understands the problem that it has helped create. The fact that it has destroyed manufacturing means it now needs policies to help re-encourage manufacturing to start again, new companies to start and for companies that are in existence to rapidly expand their output, to build new plants, and to bring in new equipment to provide new jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a vision that Australia can be a high quality provider of manufactured goods for both our own consumption and to compete in the international marketplace. If we can attack that $35 billion a year structural deficit in manufactured goods, we will solve many of these other problems&mdash;they will simply disappear and they will no longer exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that this government ought to do in addressing this problem is to say that manufacturing is important. It ought to give manufacturing a priority in government and a priority in the community. It ought to work together with those who would build companies and those who would work in them to help find the solutions to make us competitive. The second thing it ought to do is not just mouth platitudes about competition policy but really believe in it and do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our trade practices need to be examined. We need to examine the rules and regulations that come out of this place and the states that negatively affect industry and business. We need a good sound economic environment, one that is stable and does not vary from week to week and month to month, so that producers can plan for some time in the future and so that we can look with confidence at the new markets that are developing in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to not just talk about government purchasing of over $10 billion a year; we need to do something about it. We need to radically change the government's bureaucratic attitude that, if it is made in Australia, it is probably not of high quality and probably we should not be buying it. We need to change that attitude. We need to use government purchasing as a mechanism for encouraging local production so that manufacturers can get a sound base from which they may expand in order to export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to have policies in a financial sphere that encourage investment in new productive capacity, not discourage it and not frighten people away from investing their money. We need to encourage the investment of Australian savings in Australian business. We need to encourage an ethos that says that Australian manufactured goods can be the best in the world. Costs and constraints on manufacturers need to be addressed by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke earlier about the need to address reform of Australia's antiquated approach to employee relations. We need to look carefully at the mountain of regulations which the government produces and sustains that help make industry less effective than otherwise it might have been. If a business has one full-time employee working on the complexities of the fringe benefits tax, then that inefficiency is a cost to the company which must be borne by its prices in the marketplace and this helps make it less competitive than it would have been had we a simpler tax and regulation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to reform our nation's utilities: our electricity, our water supply, our sewage. We need to reform our rail transport and our wharves. We need to adopt the Hilmer proposals&mdash;to get on with it and not just talk about it. We need the government to substantially support innovation and quality and to support research and development which leads to active marketing of our products and our services both in Australia and, more particularly, overseas. We can then expand our exports to Asia in particular and our worldwide exports of radically transformed manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to address some of the myriad of government programs that we have that use taxpayers' money to support industry and to support the union movement. We need to rationalise many of these to provide a clear indication of the direction in which we wish industry to go and to give positive assistance where necessary, particularly to small and medium sized businesses which might expand if they are given half a chance. We need to rapidly enhance our education and training system so that we provide modern and relevant education for Australia's work force. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to look at some of the amendments proposed by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 which give effect to the customs tariff proposals of the No. 1 and No. 5 bills of 1994. One of the amendments resulting from this legislation seeks to decrease the customs duty payable on top crude oil by 2.977c per litre to 6.586c per litre and to decrease the customs duty payable on fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 1.977c per litre to 6.586c per litre. It seems that the adjustments in this bill go right to the margin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the bill affects the Australian system of tariff preferences which provides for preferential treatment on imports from developing countries. The countries which fall into this category will receive a discount of five per cent on general industry assistance tariffs. The bill also provides for a general rate of customs duty for semi-finished lenses. However, the amendment which I specifically wish to address is the reduction in customs duty payable on aviation gasoline and the increase in the rate of customs duty payable on aviation kerosene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two methods by which customs tariffs can be altered&mdash;firstly, through legislation and, secondly, through the introduction of customs tariff proposals, which are subsequently supported by legislation. The amendments we have before the House today result from the latter method of adjusting customs tariffs. With effect from 1 July 1994, customs tariff proposal No. 3 proposed a reduction in customs duty payable on aviation gasoline by 6.327c per litre and an increase in the rate of customs duty payable on aviation kerosene by 1.194c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the explanatory memorandum of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), the rate increase continues the process of recovering from the aviation industry the full costs incurred in implementing aviation safety standards, which commenced on 1 July 1994, and 50 per cent of the costs of safety standard setting and compliance phased in over two years from 1 July back in 1993. The government has also stated that the rate reduction for aviation kerosene is a result of the adoption by the CAA&mdash;the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;of a marginal cost basis for pricing of services provided to operators of aviation gasoline powered aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these charges being attributed to implementing aviation standards, it is the government's failure to develop a credible strategy for funding aviation safety which I wish to highlight. This is particularly evident when we look at the recent actions of the CAA with regard to aerodrome de-licensing and the resultant lack of information regarding the aerodromes or landing areas and the conditions relating to those aerodromes which have been de-licensed as a result of the changes to the regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the de-licensing of these aerodromes and the results that flowed from the changes to the civil aviation rules is that in Queensland we have seen 70 aerodromes or landing areas which were previously licensed, de-licensed. Most of these are in rural and remote parts of Queensland and it is going to cause a significant problem for those health services which are provided by aerial services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore find it ironic that the CAA is taking more money through the air safety regulation duty when its recent actions actually place in jeopardy the safety of rural health workers and their patients who rely on these aerial services. Changes by the CAA to aerodrome licensing mean that the licences for many country aerodromes have lapsed. As a result, the CAA will no longer make available the vital services relating to the current conditions prevailing at each of the previously licensed aerodromes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of this information is going to make it very difficult for pilots to obtain that information on those country aerodromes or those landing areas. It has been brought to my attention that the state based flying health services in Queensland and the Royal Flying Doctor Service based in Cairns, Mount Isa and Charleville are very concerned about these changes and what they mean to the delivery of health services to people in rural and remote Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pilots of these aerial health services, such as the flying health service which operates out of Roma and Longreach, have previously relied on the services of the Civil Aviation Authority. For those who are not familiar with the service, it is available through flight services at a CAA installation in a capital city. A pilot can obtain this information at almost a minute's notice. It then arrives by fax at the pilot's point of departure. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely; as the parliamentary secretary says, like it used to be. It no longer is available. The fax allows them to obtain information about the serviceability of the aerodromes. The shortcomings and the conditions of the individual aerodromes&mdash;such as the availability of lights or the unserviceability of lights, wet surfaces and damage which may have occurred in the previous 24 hours to that landing area&mdash;used to be publicised in the form of what are known as notams, in aviation language; or notices to airmen, in layman's terms. It is critical information needed by these pilots and has always been made available as part of air safety in the country. As a result of the de-licensing of these airports and the licences not being renewed, this will no longer be made available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Flying Doctor Service has had to write to the 70 airports, which have been de-licensed because they have not taken up the licensing requirements, to ask the people responsible in these areas whether they could advise the chief pilot of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of any changes to those airport conditions. We are dealing with a situation where the Royal Flying Doctor Service, or the state based flying health service in western Queensland, may get an emergency call at 2 a.m. for which their services are required. It is now the chief pilot's sole responsibility to obtain the information from the remote landing area, and it could be a small town airstrip. At 2 a.m. on a Sunday, he has to find out the condition of that airstrip from someone responsible in that town because it is now his sole responsibility under the new regulations to obtain that information before departure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, all that pilots had to do was dial up flight services on a fax and the information on the airport would be made available within the time frame by the delivery of that information through the technology of a modern fax. As a result of the new regulations, these pilots now have to track down a responsible person in a town, and it could be at 2 a.m. on a Sunday, who can check the condition of that airport before departure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the National Party said, it happened to us in Rolleston only two weeks ago. That airport, which has served the community for generations, is now one of those de-licensed airports. The safety of the pilots and the crew who are going in to help in an emergency, or in any routine flight health service, is at risk. I refer particularly to emergencies, because time can often mean a life. I do not believe you can compromise air safety and the safety of people who live in and fly into those areas. Clearly, in this situation, we have a compromise in this policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why were these airports originally licensed? Why was a service provided? It was a service provided to the people of rural or remote Australia in the interest of health services. It was a service that was funded through the Civil Aviation Authority's budget. Unfortunately, a greater load and a greater responsibility are going to be put on the pilots before they fly into some of those remote airstrips and town airports where the licences have not been renewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Royal Flying Doctor Service is so concerned should set alarm bells ringing for everyone who serves in this House. I think the Royal Flying Doctor Service is one of the great institutions in this nation. It has been a great mantle of safety stretching right across Australia. It will answer calls at any time of the day or night. Not only does it answer those calls from the people living in rural and remote areas, but the many tourists who travel to the outback of Australia also have access to the services of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It delivers services to those people without question. Of course, we all know the great record of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, which seeks to increase the levy on aviation gasoline for aviation safety really flies in the face of the services actually being delivered. We have seen a deterioration of the safety services provided by the Civil Aviation Authority.

Not only was coastal shipping hit by the fuel oil tax hike, but mineral processors, like the Gladstone based firm Queensland Alumina, were also equally burdened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand the origins of this bill, we must go back to the 1993-94 budget, a horror budget for most Australians and certainly a horror budget for people of central Queensland. In that budget, the government announced that it would immediately increase the duty on leaded and unleaded petrol, diesel and fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene by 3c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaded petrol was to then rise by a further 2c a litre in February and August 1994 and by another 3c in February 1995&mdash;in total, a massive 10c per litre. Unleaded petrol, diesel and fuel oil were to rise 1c per litre when rates were to be indexed in both February and August of last year, taking the total tax hike for these fuel products to 5c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Politicians in this House will remember the initial furore that erupted in the community over these proposed increases in fuel tax, especially amongst coastal shippers and mineral processors. On 6 September 1993, a coalition of shipping industry groups, including BHP and the Maritime Union, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). At the time that group estimated that the impact of a 5c per litre increase in excise on marine fuel oil would result in a cost impost on Australian coastal shipping of $16.1 million&mdash;or $358,000 per vessel&mdash;per annum by August 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What was most annoying to the shipping industry was that, in one fell swoop, the government was able to obliterate any savings flowing from hard fought Australian shipping industry reforms in relation to manning levels. With the ink barely dry on the reform agreement to reduce manning costs by some $270,000 per vessel per annum, the government then imposed a tax impost of $360,000 per vessel per annum, wiping out any potential gains for the industry&mdash;in fact, the industry was further behind by $90,000 per vessel. Similarly, the mineral processing sector was hit by the fuel oil tax hike but in a number of different ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Maritime Association estimated in 1993 that nearly 60 per cent of the coastal shipping task was for the carriage of minerals for further processing. So, not surprisingly, the freight costs for shipping minerals around our coastline were set to rise because of this tax hike. More importantly for the value adding sector was the direct impact of the tax hike on its production costs. My colleague the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has already spelt out how a 5c per litre increase in fuel oil would have added $9 per tonne to Nabalco's production costs, effectively imposing a 13 per cent levy on its alumina exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact was equally devastating for another alumina refiner, QAL, which, as I said earlier, is in my electorate of Hinkler. While this company had converted from fuel oil to natural gas in 1989 because of previous fuel oil hikes, the impact of the 5c a litre rise was still estimated to cost the company an additional $8.2 million. This is because the pricing formula for its natural gas contract includes a component pegged to the delivery costs of fuel oil plus excise. There is a tendency for gas prices, even though they are not related directly to excise, to follow the fuel oil price upwards. So any time there is an excise adjustment to fuel oil it is felt indirectly in natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Here we have a major value adding mineral processor producing around 10 per cent of the world alumina's supply, a major employer in regional Australia, being slugged with an extra $8 million&mdash;hardly sound economic policy for such an important export generating sector of the economy, let alone clever politics. But, as history records during the tortuous 1993-94 budget negotiations in the Senate, the government was forced to back down on a number of fuel tax measures, including the final 3c a litre rate increase for leaded petrol, adjusting the total rise for leaded petrol to 7c a litre instead of 10c; and the February and August 1994 increases for fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene, taking the rise to 3c instead of 5c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still not satisfied, the coastal shipping and mining industries continued to lobby the government for further reductions in fuel oil excise. Finally, last year the government conceded that even the 3c per litre increase had an adverse effect on these industries and announced that it would remove 2c of the 3c a litre increase in fuel oil excise it had imposed the year before. The bill enacts that decision to partially offset the 3c a litre increase in the fuel oil excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has previously viewed this measure as a saving for the Australian shipping industry. It is nothing of the kind. Quite simply, it is a belated admission that the government was irresponsible and wrong to impose the added excise in the first place. Far from having saved the shipping industry $8.4 million a year, the decision still leaves in place 1c per litre of the 1993-94 increase, which is still costing the industry $4.2 million a year or $96,000 per vessel per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mineral processors like QAL at Gladstone are still faced with 1c a litre increase in the fuel oil excise, which is another government imposed burden that they are forced to carry. This bill is simply an admission by the government that the tax hike was counterproductive&mdash;something that the coalition has been saying right from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An equally vocal opponent of the government's 1993-94 fuel tax increases has been the road transport industry. It is disappointing to see that the government has decided not to re-examine the impact of the fuel tax rises on this sector, in particular, diesel and petrol. The Road Transport Forum estimated that the 5c a litre increase in excise on diesel fuel has cost the average truckie an extra $6,000 per rig per year, not to mention an additional $400 or so per year per rig for the extra two per cent rise in sales tax on tyres and associated equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordinary motorists have also been the victims of this government's bowser banditry. Since the last CPI adjustment, as at 1 February this year, motorists are paying 32.5c tax on every litre of unleaded or diesel fuel and 34.5c tax on every litre of leaded petrol they use. In most centres, particularly in regional Australia, this represents about half of the actual price of fuel. So every time motorists fill their tanks they are essentially paying half their petrol bill to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A former shadow minister for minerals and energy, none other than Paul Keating himself, noted as far back as 1980, `This is a shocking thing that every petrol pump has become an office of the taxation department&mdash;a shocking thing.' So the Prime Minister has not changed his rhetoric over the years. The only difference is that the boot is on the other foot. It has been done by none other than Paul Keating, as I said, and his government, who over the last 11 or 12 years has turned this rort into something of an art form&mdash;taking more and more fuel taxes and returning less to road funding, the sole purpose for which the taxes were originally created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the figures&mdash;and I think they speak for themselves&mdash;you will note that in 1983 these fuel taxes raised $2 billion, and 56 per cent or 56c in every dollar collected was returned to road funding. Now, in 1994-95, the government raises $9.7 billion of which a meagre eight per cent or 8c in every dollar is returned to roads. Fuel excise was just over 6c a litre when Labor came to power and is now 34c a litre if you are unfortunate enough to still have to drive a leaded fuel car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 contains a number of tariff measures but none more significant and damaging than those relating to sections of industry and shipping that depend on fuel oil duties. Government members may applaud the measure, and I certainly do, in so far as it has reduced that increase from 3c to 1c. It is a shame that the government did not seek to reverse some of these tax hikes on petrol and diesel as well.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the 1995-96 budget almost upon us, let us hope the government will not make the same mistakes again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say at this point that I have grave concerns given the statements of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) on the possibility of a 5c a litre excise for environmental measures. Regardless of the reason it is raised, it will have a profound effect on the Australian shipping industry. It will negate for a second time what has happened. What a farce it would be if, having backed down on this measure as late as 28 February 1995, the government reimposes some other excise in its May budget in the name of the environmental movement. Such a farcical situation would create greater uncertainty in the shipping industry and also in value added type industries that I have mentioned in Central Queensland which either use fuel oil themselves or are affected by the excise on fuel oil in so far as it indirectly affects the price of gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also mention that excise has played an important part in the lack of viability or the lack of competitiveness on branch lines in the railway system. I know two lines in my electorate were profoundly affected by the government's measures on excise on diesel, and I can only say that another 5c a litre will impose&mdash;as I said before, be it as an environmental levy or for some other reason&mdash;an equally devastating effect on branch lines such as the Moura to Gladstone line and the Maryborough to Monto to Gladstone line, both of which form an important part of the infrastructure of the lower part of Central Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up, whilst I applaud the measure, I make those three observations: firstly, it should have occurred earlier; secondly, the government should have removed the total 3c from the fuel oil; and, thirdly, let us hope the government does not repeat its mistake by imposing a 5c a litre levy as part of its environmental agenda. </PARA>

There has been a decrease of 2.977c per litre in the duty on topped crude oil. In this summing up, why is it necessary for me to correct these issues? I am disappointed in the honourable member for Hinkler in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the speech of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), there has been a wide ranging debate outside the normal latitude allowed in the standing orders of this House when dealing with this technical bill. The fact is that on 12 October 1994 the government announced that it would assume financial responsibility for the public interest component of aviation safety regulation. The government's contribution will fund that portion of aviation safety regulation that has been identified as being of benefit to the general public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say, as is recognised by aviation users, that this demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that aviation safety regulation in Australia is adequately funded, and so it must be. That is why the government will lift its contribution from the former index cap of $22.8 million per year to more than $29 million in 1995-96. These new funding arrangements will apply to the new Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which is scheduled to commence operation on 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is part of a package of measures being introduced by the government to ensure that the needs of air safety regulation in Australia and the requirements of aviation users in Australia are satisfactorily met. Indeed, the increase of 1.194c per litre in the customs duty on aviation turbine fuel is balanced by an equivalent increase in the moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral, and that is also the case on aviation gasoline. That point must be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally, I would not comment on the contributions made by honourable members because they are outside the technical nature of the bill, but some of the statements made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) need to be corrected on the record. The latest Bureau of Industry Economics industry brief report dated February 1995, which is a public document, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The manufacturing sector is growing almost twice as fast as the economy overall. The output growth of 12.2 per cent posted in the year to the September quarter 1994 is the highest on record and has resulted in much of the spare capacity within the manufacturing sector being taken up.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very significant point. Manufacturing production grew steadily in the September quarter 1994, rising by 1.5 per cent, and the growth rate for the 12 months to the September quarter 1994 came in at 12.2 per cent. That is the highest since the Australian Bureau of Statistics quarterly series began in 1974 and, as the bureau says, it is a remarkable result. Furthermore, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current annual growth rate is around four times the long-term trend growth rate of total production within the Australian economy over the last two decades. </PARA>
<PARA>That is in total contrast to the claims made by the honourable member for La Trobe. Where opposition members get the information to make these claims in the House really beggars imagination. All they need to do is obtain the relevant information from the Bureau of Industry Economics&mdash;it is all here and beyond debate&mdash;and use that information in this House if they wish. Again, he mentioned manufacturing investment. According to the bureau in its February bulletin, manufacturing investment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . grew by 10.3 per cent . . . in the September quarter 1994, following a remarkable 19.5 per cent rise in the June quarter. This investment wave has been driven almost exclusively by rising investment in equipment, plant and machinery, contributing 90.9 per cent of the rise over the six months.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strength of the recent investment surge is clearly demonstrated by the fact that equipment, plant and machinery investment levels are now 3.5 per cent higher than the pre-recession peak in the June quarter 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to deal with the imports of products and, in particular, the manufacturing product groups which very much deal with the investment intensive machinery and equipment dominated imports and so forth, which ultimately go to produce our manufacturing capacity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a source of disappointment for me to hear the honourable member for La Trobe, who is normally the most erudite and clear thinking individual, make these claims which are in clear contradiction of the information which is freely available to him from the Bureau of Industry Economics. I do not intend in this debate on a narrow bill to deal with some of the other claims made by other speakers with respect to other economic indices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is unnecessary, except to say that the growth of the Australian economy, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, is currently about 6.4 per cent. These are not my figures; they come from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. From 1983 to 1993 the average rate of growth in the Australian economy has been about 3.3 per cent. That is considerably higher than the OECD average of about 2.8 per cent. These are indisputable facts, and these are facts which all Australians should be proud to acknowledge, particularly in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is being unopposed by the opposition. I place on record my appreciation of other speakers on the bill, particularly the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who, with the exception of a few statements, made quite a constructive speech and demonstrated an understanding of the nature of the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available to me I wish to examine the impact of the excise and customs duty on fuel oil on the bauxite mine and alumina refinery operated by Nabalco at Gove in the Northern Territory. I raise this matter because it is a trenchant example of Labor's failure to maintain an effective and equitable investment regime in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security of investment is critical for resource projects as they are typified by high capital costs, high risk, long lead times between discovery and production, and finely judged financial returns. Thus, once the decision to invest has been made, resource projects are sensitive to changes in factors such as taxation arrangements and, in this case, excise and customs duties. In effect, the Gove operation has been singled out for discriminatory taxation treatment, seriously undermining its competitiveness with refineries in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of this issue is the so-called Gove agreement between the Gove joint venturers and the governments of the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth. Clause 12, paragraph (1) of the agreement states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to ensure that no Act or ordinance is passed that will impose . . . discriminatory taxes, discriminatory rates or discriminatory charges of any nature whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA>This clear and unequivocal statement was essential to provide the confidence for the investors in the refinery to go ahead at this very remote location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of commissioning in 1972, fuel oil was not subject to excise or customs duty; nor was there any alternative to using fuel oil as an energy source at Gove. However, in 1983 the Labor government imposed a 2c per litre tax on fuel oil with the rate indexed to the consumer price index. While other Australian refiners were able to switch to natural gas to avoid this excise, this was not feasible at Gove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the imposition of the excise in 1983 could arguably have been in contravention of the Gove agreement&mdash;clause 12 that I have just read out, specifically&mdash;Nabalco was able to absorb the tax at this level. It is essential to remember that there is no possibility for Nabalco to pass on an impost of this kind to its customers. Aluminium is traded in a fiercely competitive international market, so any extraordinary costs on intermediate inputs such as fuel oil must be absorbed by the company and ultimately reduce the return to shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After substantial investment at Gove in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nabalco was able to reduce its production costs by $10 per tonne of alumina. Meanwhile, the fuel oil excise was continuing to rise, kicked along by the government's iniquitous tactic of pegging the rate of excise to the consumer price index. By 1993, the excise had reached 5 1/2c per litre, and Nabalco was the only alumina refinery in Australia unable to switch from fuel oil to other energy sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With consumption of some 465,000 litres of fuel oil per year, Nabalco was paying $26 million per year in excise, effectively losing the benefits of the efficiency improvements which had been made at the turn of the decade. Not content with this, the Labor government foreshadowed a 5c per litre increase in the fuel oil excise and customs duty in the 1993 budget. This would have almost doubled Nabalco's fuel oil excise bill, but the increases were subsequently held to 3c per litre by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1994 budget, the government recognised the impact of the increases on the mining and shipping industries and decreased the excise and customs duty by 1.977c per litre. This decrease in the customs duty will be enshrined in legislation as a result of the bill before the House. But compared with the situation just prior to the 1993 budget, Nabalco is still penalised an extra $4.7 million per year as a result of this rapid and ill-judged series of increases and decreases. In total, Nabalco continues to pay $30 million per year in fuel oil excise, which is 60 per cent of the revenue received from fuel oil excise other than that from coastal shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the imposition of this excise and customs duty impacts inequitably on one player in the fiercely competitive aluminium industry. There is also the question of whether the excise violates the Gove agreement, in which the Commonwealth agreed not to impose discriminatory taxes on the refinery. In any case, this saga highlights the extent of sovereign risk faced by business which is investing in Australia's resource industries. The government needs to bear in mind that any revenue which it thinks it will be winning by this legislation will ultimately be lost because of the effect of the legislation on the business investment climate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the second time that this legislation has been introduced into this House. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 first passed this House on 11 October 1994. Regrettably the opposition did not support the bill on that occasion and voted with others in the Senate to defeat the bill in that place on 9 November last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) stated at the time that the government considered the bill of such importance that it would be reintroduced as soon as possible. The government did not accept the refusal of the opposition to support this vital legislation and would give the opposition another chance to support it. The government welcomes the opposition's belated acceptance of the importance of this bill and its indication that it will now support it. The bill itself is unchanged from that which the opposition rejected last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, through its proposed changes to section 35 and 36 of the act&mdash;which were renumbered in December 1989 to become sections 87 and 88 respectively&mdash;seeks to restore to those sections the effect they were thought to possess prior to the decision of the High Court in Chu Kheng Lim v. Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in December 1992. It was this decision which gave rise to the commencement of claims against the Commonwealth for compensation for wrongful imprisonment of a number of unauthorised boat arrivals who are usually referred to as boat people. Prior to this decision no-one had questioned the use of section 36 of the act&mdash;from December 1989 to September 1994 numbered as section 88&mdash;to detain the unauthorised arrivals in question. Indeed, those sections were not challenged in the Lim proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 36 of the act deals with people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation and who may be kept in custody until the departure of the vessel from its last port of call in Australia. Up until May 1991, unauthorised boat arrivals of this kind were detained in custody under this section while their claims to remain in Australia were assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Lim case, other aspects of migration legislation involving boat people were challenged and doubt was subsequently cast upon the lawfulness of detention for a number of boat people under section 88 once it became apparent that the boats on which they had arrived would never depart Australia. This doubt turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the understanding that the vessel be expected to leave Australia on a further, outward and ongoing voyage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, the Commonwealth acted on a mistaken view of what the law was, believing&mdash;like all other concerned parties&mdash;that its detention of boat people was lawful. It is significant that no-one, apparently including the boat people themselves&mdash;and their legal representatives&mdash;saw any reason to question the lawfulness of detention on the basis that none of the vessels on which they had arrived had ever left Australia. Should that custody prove to have been unlawful, it is as a result of an innocent and technical breach, and no more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people did arrive in Australia unlawfully, and their detention was based on the understanding of the provisions of section 36 (section 88) by the government and the department at that time. Nevertheless, actions for damages have been lodged by some 88 of the boat people who now maintain that their detention under section 36 (section 88) was unlawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New provisions to detain unauthorised boat arrivals came into effect in May 1992 with the commencement of division 4B of the act. These provisions, under which the boat people have been detained since May 1992, were found by the High Court in the Lim case to be constitutionally valid. However, at that time the High Court cast doubt upon the use of section 88 to detain boat people. As a consequence, section 54RA was enacted in late December 1992 with the support of the opposition. This section extinguished the right of action for damages for false imprisonment for persons found to have been unlawfully detained under section 88 prior to their transfer to custody under division 4B of the act, replacing it with a statutory right of action limiting to one dollar per day the damages payable. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential to counter the possibility of significant damages claims. It would be absurd for the Australian taxpayer to be expected to underwrite compensation payments to people who arrived here without authority and who have been detained on reasonable grounds while their claims to remain were exhaustively examined.</PARA>
<PARA>A case challenging the constitutional validity of the compensation scheme established in section 54RA&mdash;I repeat that the compensation scheme in section 54RA was regarded as constitutionally valid when it was established&mdash;is yet to be heard by the High Court. The main ground for challenge is likely to be that section 54RA breaches section 51(xxxi) of the constitution in that it involves an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth otherwise than on just terms. A number of High Court decisions since section 54RA was enacted on the ambit of the `just terms' requirement in the constitution have raised doubts whether the limit on damages to one dollar per day is constitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I earlier remarked, the amendments proposed seek to reflect the Commonwealth's previous understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88), and their operation. Legislative amendments of this kind can be classed as `curative', which retrospectively correct defects discovered in the law or its administration, and restores what was previously thought by all parties to be the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent High Court judgments involving the `just terms' requirement of our constitution have suggested that this approach of `curative' legislation is an avenue available to the Commonwealth. Indeed the courts, including the present Chief Justice of the High Court, have emphasised that it is always open for parliament to correct developments in the law other than in constitutional matters, where those developments do not accord with parliament's intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for curative legislation is the strong public interest in the proper functioning of government. Occasional defects in administration or statutory drafting are inevitable. It may be fairly argued that a law which seeks retrospectively to cure innocent defects does not take away rights. It merely gives effect to administrative action already taken. It should be noted that this action was previously assumed by all relevant parties to be valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill&mdash;Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 [No. 2]&mdash;is substantially identical to Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 introduced in the other place on 8 June 1994. The government has introduced this bill to the House with the intention of placing the Commonwealth in the strongest possible position to defend the claims for compensation. The bill seeks only to achieve the same effect as what was intended by the enactment of section 54RA; that is, to prevent a possible windfall of a substantial award of damages to persons who arrived in Australia without lawful authority and were held in detention for the legitimate reason of assessing their claims to stay in this country as refugees. In this way, the government seeks to ensure that section 88 has, and has always had, the effect and operation that parliament intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition parties were influenced in their decision to oppose the curative measures in this bill when it was introduced in the other place by the dissenting report of its members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its consideration of the No.2 bill. That report attempts to distinguish the proposed curative steps in the bill from the dollar a day provision on the ground of retrospectivity. This is pure sophistry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 54RA limits any compensation payable to $1 per day after the cause of action concerned has already arisen. Thus the parliament has already applied retrospective measures to substantially limit the claims of the boat people for compensation. Sufficient doubt has now been placed upon the measures taken to date for the government to accept the necessity of pursuing further retrospective measures of a curative nature to ensure that the Commonwealth is in the strongest possible position to defend these claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report also adopted the line pursued in the submission of the Law Council of Australia before the committee&mdash;that the curative measures would distort the relationship between the legislative and judicial arms of government. This submission ignores the well-established prerogative of the parliament to legislate so as to affect and alter existing rights at issue in pending litigation without interfering with the exercise of judicial power in a way that is inconsistent with the constitution. Until the High Court decides otherwise, curative legislation of this nature remains a valid course open to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the curative provisions of the bill. The amendments to sections 35 and 36 (sections 87 and 88) do not seek to change the operation of those sections but insert new provisions intended instead to reflect the Commonwealth's understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) and the manner in which they were actually administered in practice prior to the commencement of division 4B. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted at every stage of the drafting process. It is the view of that department that the amendments are not inconsistent with Australia's obligations under international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) seeks to put beyond doubt that section 36 (section 88) authorises the custody, for a finite period, of persons who arrive without lawful authority on board a vessel that subsequently is unable to depart Australia because it has been destroyed or, for example, is not seaworthy, has been impounded or forfeited, has sunk, or is otherwise unable to depart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment also permits the taking and keeping of persons in custody, notwithstanding that the vessel on which those persons departed for Australia might not necessarily be the same vessel on which those persons arrive. It is restricted to persons who arrive on vessels that have left an Australian port and returned to an Australian port without having entered any other country. This covers situations where a person arrives at a port in Australia on an Australian based vessel, to which the person was transferred from the vessel on which that person left another country&mdash;for instance, to a rescue vessel when the original vessel is about to sink. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances envisaged by new subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) it is not appropriate that the period for which a person may be detained should be determined by reference to the departure of a vessel from a port. The proposed amendments will therefore provide that custody is to be authorised until the person is granted an entry permit, or for such period as is necessary to allow for the person's removal from Australia, following a request in writing from the person to be removed, or after all applications to remain&mdash;for example, entry permit applications and applications for refugee status&mdash;and associated appeals or reviews have been finalised, or once all consideration of whether the person will be permitted to remain in Australia has been otherwise concluded, or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the act, a person is considered to have entered Australia once they disembark in Australia. Proposed subsection 36(1AB) (subsection 88(1B)) makes it clear that a person is taken not to have entered Australia as a result of temporarily, haphazardly disembarking&mdash;for instance, on an island off the Australian mainland, briefly and without the knowledge of the Australian authorities&mdash;after which the person then reboards their vessel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment to section 35 (section 87) similarly does not seek to alter its existing operation but instead inserts specific provisions, to avoid any doubts, as to the extent of the power under this section. Under it an officer may, to prevent a person from entering Australia unlawfully, require a vessel to enter a port and require unauthorised persons to remain on that vessel until it arrives at the port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that these simple, commonsense amendments, curative in nature, seek no more than to ensure that sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) of the act have and have had the operation and effect that parliament intends them to have, which is the operation and effect which the department and ministers previously understood those provisions to have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also inserts a constitutional validity or `reading down' provision. This will provide, unless a contrary intention can be clearly discerned, that where a provision of the act could have both valid and invalid applications the provision is to have every valid application and is not to have any invalid application. The provision is similar to and consistent with `reading down' provisions in certain other Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the doubt over the validity of section 54RA the government proposes to repeal that section in this bill. By supporting the curative steps proposed by this bill the parliament can provide the Commonwealth with the strongest possible position for the defence of the boat peoples' claims. In doing so the parliament will not, as I have outlined above, be embracing retrospectivity for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament has already demonstrated its will to protect the Commonwealth, and the taxpayer, from the potential burden of compensation payments to those unauthorised boat arrivals who were detained under section 88 while their claims to remain in Australia were exhaustively assessed. The government's commitment to this position is demonstrated by the introduction of the curative measures in this bill. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In following the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), I foreshadow that on this occasion we will not oppose the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), as she mentioned in her speech. We are reluctant converts in relation to this matter. We opposed the bill on the last occasion because of its retrospectivity. The bill is still retrospective in its impact. We took an on balance decision taking into account a number of matters, particularly the potential cost to the public purse if the bill did not proceed and community concern about paying compensation to people who arrived in Australia illegally, in this instance by boats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since we took that decision we have been made aware of very considerable concerns&mdash;some of them generated I think by the way in which the government dealt with this matter&mdash;about rewarding illegal immigrants with compensation and of the increasing community concern generally about the ongoing arrival of people by boats in recent times where they do not appear prima facie to be bone fide refugee claimants. As has been the case previously, we have endeavoured to facilitate, and over the last several weeks have again facilitated, legislation to try to assist the government in dealing with these ongoing problems, notwithstanding the government's lamentable failure to deal with these matters in a timely fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding on balance today not to vote against this bill on the second occasion, we have taken into account the clearly expressed views of the community, particularly when people are concerned about expenditure at this time and when the arguments have not been adduced again about, potentially, the size of the claims that might be involved. But, obviously, we are concerned, at a time when the community is being called upon to consider expenditure reductions of a significant order, that it would be irresponsible of us to be seen to appear to oppose measures that may address that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that we remain opposed to the retrospectivity contained in this bill. We expressed our strong concern on the previous occasion, and that should be noted. I want to take the opportunity, given the nature of the second reading speech by the parliamentary secretary, to make it clear that we are not alone in our concern about retrospectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that some members of the government have allowed their names to go forward, associated with expressions of those concerns. Of course, those members of the government who have expressed those concerns in another place have voted with the government for the passage of this bill. I note Senator Colston, Senator Cooney and Senator Forshaw who are members of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note, when we read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> put out by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, that the Senate committee does record its concern at the retrospectivity of these bills, the fact that they unduly trespass upon personal rights and liberties. By way of background, it dealt with the issue of the way in which we treat Australians and aliens, and our obligations under international law. It looked at some of the points that were made in the Chu Kheng Lim case and the views of the High Court on that matter. It looked at the government's rationale for justifying retrospectivity. It recorded in its report that the government's explanatory memorandum contained three elements. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the amendments need to be retrospective to prevent a possible windfall through substantial awards of damages;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">because the Minister and the Department thought that the law gave them power to detain these people in custody, it ought to be changed retrospectively so that it will be taken to have meant from 1 <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> November 1989 what the Minister and the Department understood it to mean; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">none of those who were unlawfully imprisoned had sought to challenge lawfulness of their custody before the High Court said that it was <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee addressed each one of those matters in turn. On the first matter, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee suggested that the first element was founded on the notion that an award of damages is a windfall. Inherent to the notion of a windfall is that the person who picks up by chance what the wind of fortune has cause to fall at his or her feet has no right to that property.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say, however, that unlawful imprisonment, which this involved, carries a right to just compensation, and the concept of windfall has no application. On the second matter, the committee went on to say that the second element clearly trespassed on the basic right that those subject to law are entitled to know what the law says and be treated in accordance with what the law says, ultimately according to what the courts declare the law to mean. As far back as 1765 in his commentaries, Sir William Blackstone said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a base resolution, confined in the breast of the legislator, without manifesting itself by some external sign, can never be properly a law. It is requisite that this resolution be notified to the people who are to obey it.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the committee's opinion the third element did not overcome the hurdle that the right of a person to challenge the unlawful excess of authority does not take away the obligation of the person exercising authority to ensure that the use of that authority is within power.</PARA>
<PARA>The rationale given for retrospectivity, therefore, in the committee's view did not appear to justify validating unlawful imprisonment. The minister gave the committee the courtesy of a reply and that reply picked up some of the arguments that we have seen set out in the explanatory memorandum, reiterated again in the parliamentary secretary's speech today, although I think there are some new elements that I will address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee then deliberated on that matter again and came to the view that the minister had not addressed the concept of responsibility and accountability for a person exercising authority to ensure that the use of authority is within power. The scrutiny of bills committee could not be expected to agree that the law ought not to be what parliament has passed but what the minister thought had been passed. In other words, the scrutiny of bills committee, which included three Labor members, was of the opinion that this view was flawed. In a sense, some members of the government have come to an on-balance view on this matter. That is the reason, I assume, for their support of the bill, notwithstanding the views they have expressed in this report&mdash;seeing how they voted that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech the parliamentary secretary gave today was very interesting because it dealt with a number of matters&mdash;and I want to pick them up in turn&mdash;that suggest the extent to which the parliament first addressed these matters in 1992. When I spoke on this matter before, I mentioned the discussions I had with former Minister Hand about the way in which this issue ought to be dealt with and the view the opposition held at that time that to retrospectively validate unlawful imprisonment was something that ought not be a course lightly embarked upon. We put the view to the government that it was more appropriate to do what was done in other areas quite frequently; that is, where a damages claim might well be founded, we came to the view that, if the courts found there was an entitlement to damages, it was appropriate for the parliament to prospectively quantify that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a course that is followed in a whole range of areas of law. It is not alien for parliaments to quantify damages that courts might otherwise award. It happens in the workers compensation area. It certainly did not seem to us that that was an inappropriate way to go. The government has clearly come to the view&mdash;and it is expressed in the second reading speech&mdash;that, because of other provisions in the constitution, while the states might be able to quantify damages, the Commonwealth cannot because of the just term provisions in our constitution. That is the reason why they are asking us to approve this retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with this matter, one needs to realise that, notwithstanding our on-balance view that this bill should pass, the courts, when they come to deal with it, may well have another close look at the way in which the government deals with this question. The government's drafting needs to be such that every `i' has been dotted and every `t' crossed. It is well known in the law that, if the court finds that the legislation on this occasion is flawed, it would read it down because of its retrospective nature. The government had better get it right, because if it does not have it right it may well fail again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the justification in relation to this turns on the view that the legislative amendments can be classed as curative. The parliamentary secretary's second reading speech says that curative legislation retrospectively corrects defects discovered in the law and its administration and restores what was previously thought by all parties to be the status quo. It is interesting to read the parliamentary secretary's justification for this statement. If it is genuinely curative, the courts might look at it as being appropriate retrospective legislation. The government is very anxious to bring the drafting within that ambit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government makes the following observation: the rationale for curative legislation is the strong public interest in the proper functioning of government. Occasional defects in administration or statutory drafting are inevitable. It may be fairly argued that a law which seeks retrospectively to cure innocent defects does not take away rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a discussion about section 54RA and, of course, the impact of the former section 88. For the sake of completeness I would like to draw attention to some comments I offered on the previous occasion in relation to the operation of section 88. I dare say the courts will look at the understanding of this matter very carefully because, administratively or otherwise, it seemed to me that the sections that were drafted were not drafted originally in a form that was even meant to comprehend a situation of the type to which it was ultimately applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is the point that needs to be understood. Essentially, section 88&mdash;as I emphasised on the previous occasion&mdash;was put in the legislation to deal with stowaways, people who might be apprehended in the port and be delivered back to their boat when it was about to depart the port. That is why we have this concept, which the court picked up in this instance when it was asked to look at section 88, of the custody of certain persons during the stay of a vessel in port. That is why the section was drawn that way. It was never really envisaged that there might be a situation in which people would sail in in a boat which might sink when in territorial waters or might have to be destroyed for quarantine reasons and not be there to sail away on at the end of the day. Asylum seekers were never expecting to sail away at the end of that process. Yet that is what the legislation was designed to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be quite clear to everybody&mdash;I am sure it will be clear to the courts when they address this matter&mdash;that the government came to a section of the legislation and said, `Maybe we can get it to fit the particular case.' It was not a section which was put in the legislation because somebody had an innocent view that there was a defect in the law or its administration that was later discovered, nor was it a matter of restoring what was previously thought by all to be the status quo. It was never that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand why the government is saying what it is. It knows the legislation is flawed. We are going to let it go through so it can be tested by the courts. It is an on balance view and the courts are going to look at it; but they are going to look at it not against what is written in the second reading speech but against the context of the whole debate: including the explanatory memorandum and the history of this matter. I think in that context we will yet see some very interesting litigation emerging from the legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said right at the beginning of my remarks, the opposition is always very cooperative in these matters and always wanting to offer helpful advice. These are matters that could have been addressed in a timely fashion before the courts ever got into the business of looking at them, if the government had turned its mind to it. The situation is no different in relation to this matter than it is in the belated way the government is asking us to look at other matters where it could have acted earlier, dealt with them in a timely fashion and produced a very different outcome from that which we are experiencing today. If the government had acted promptly to warn people, particularly in southern China, about the nature of our law and expectations, many people may not have embarked upon hazardous courses of travel to Australia, putting their lives and the lives of their families at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had shown some competence in dealing with these matters, we would not be looking at legislation of this sort today which breaches principles that we have all held to be significant over a long period of time and we would not have been addressing some of the other legislation in the migration area that we have seen. As I say, this legislation will be acceded to by the opposition, but it is an on-balance view taken against the background of the circumstances in which the community has concerns about the potential costs that are involved. We have determined to accede to it. </PARA>

Everyone in the region will then clearly know that Australia's position is that you cannot jump the queue simply by getting into a boat and coming here but that you have to have genuine refugee concerns.

It is true to say that the vast majority of those people have been accommodated one way or other.

Although it is clear that we do sympathise with those people who consider that they can have an economic and social life here superior to that which they would have in China, the reality is that that is not a sufficient condition to be a refugee because if we accepted all those people who wanted a better economic and social existence, we would literally be faced with many millions of people wanting to come to Australia&mdash;many millions of people. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Speaker, the House will recall that the government's original legislation on this matter was debated at great length here during August and September last year. It has since been the subject of one of the longest debates ever conducted on the floor of the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government accepted 21 of those amendments on the floor of the Senate, despite having reservations about many of them. In the hope that bipartisan support for the bill can still be achieved, we have since agreed to accept a number of other amendments. All of these changes are incorporated in the bill now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot agree to the remainder of the Senate's changes. Among them, there are a number which undermine the very purpose of the bill, and would make the administration of the land fund a bureaucratic and legal nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that outcome, the government was obliged to consider its options, in particular whether it could proceed at all with a land fund so crippled by the Senate. Because the measure is of such fundamental importance to all Australians, we have decided to ask the parliament to have a second look at it. I will briefly describe the basis upon which the government will do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 November 1994, at the end of its marathon debate on the original bill, the Senate appointed a select committee to inquire into the acceptability of its own amendments among indigenous Australians. In all the circumstances&mdash;with the Senate declining to deal further with the amendments, and the request rejected and returned to it by the House of Representatives&mdash;the government considers that there has been a failure to pass the bill within the meaning of section 57 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill I am now presenting differs from the version passed by this House last year to the extent only that it includes, verbatim, the Senate amendments to which the government is prepared to agree. Otherwise, the clauses are in the form and wording previously approved by the House. Honourable members may have noticed that one of the amendments accepted by the government was a Greens proposal to change the title. The legislation now before us is called the Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have considered the bill here, it will be returned in its new form to the Senate. I hope reason will prevail in that place on this occasion and that the land fund, which we had hoped and expected would be up and running by now, will be able to get started as soon as possible. The government is encouraged somewhat on this point by the comments of the chairman of the Senate select committee after its report was tabled on 9 January this year. He suggested that there was no longer any point in `forcing' the disputed amendments in the Senate. As Senator Campbell's views have not been contradicted it is to be hoped that his view will prevail&mdash;and prevail soon&mdash;among those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to the amendments and the parliamentary progress of the bill in a moment. To assist honourable members in following the argument through the maze created by the Senate I table a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senate Amendments to the Land Fund Bill</EMPHASIS> which categorises and describes the Senate's amendments and indicates the government's position on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to remind honourable members of what the government's original bill was about, and where it fits in one of the most important series of related measures ever brought before the Australian parliament. The context for these measures is a pivotal part of this government's long-term agenda&mdash;that is, the promotion of reconciliation between indigenous Australians and other Australians; the national pursuit of greater understanding, greater respect, for our indigenous heritage; a just accounting for the wrongs done to indigenous Australians since European occupation of this country; and a coordinated campaign across all tiers of government to address the environmental and primary health problems faced by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been pursuing this great agenda consistently and methodically, confident of the continuing support of a country whose people share common aspirations and who embrace with pride the unique diversity of its people, culture and heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little more than two years ago, our progress towards reconciliation received an enormously important fillip from the judiciary. The High Court of Australia, in its Mabo decision, created judicial history by putting an end to the legal fiction of terra nullius&mdash;thus recognising the prior title to Australian land of its traditional, indigenous owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court's decision caused a dramatic increase in public interest in the process of reconciliation&mdash;in the way the rest of us are coming to terms with the damage we and our forebears have done to our indigenous fellow citizens.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also created a strong&mdash;and legitimate&mdash;expectation among Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders that the whole Australian society, through this parliament, would reinforce the High Court's decision and carry its spirit through to some logical&mdash;and just&mdash;conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Land Fund and Indigenous Land Corporation (ATSIC Amendment) Bill is the second major plank in the government's response to Mabo and the challenges thrown up by that decision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first, of course, was the Native Title Act of 1993, which gave statutory protection to the indigenous rights identified by the court and set up an equitable system to determine where, and by whom, those rights could be enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Act added huge symbolic weight to the Mabo decision. It announced that the Australian people supported the great principles of justice inherent in the court's decision and were determined to see them applied. But the application was limited to those people who were able to prove a continuing association with their land. Many indigenes were, of course, dispossessed of their land in earlier periods and many remain on the margins of this country's economic, social and cultural life. The Native Title Act, though great in significance and utility, cannot by its nature solve the problems of dispossession and alienation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the government's response to Mabo will be a set of social justice measures designed to preserve and protect the cultural identity of our indigenous peoples while removing barriers which keep them at the margins of society as a whole. In a very real sense, the bill now before the House is itself a key component of our social justice response. It deals exclusively, however, with land&mdash;that critical part of the indigenous heritage which has been taken away from so many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason&mdash;the essential importance of land in the resolution of outstanding issues between this nation and its indigenous peoples&mdash;that this bill was introduced as a separate and distinct element of the government's response to Mabo. Honourable members will know the content of the bill as it was introduced and passed in this chamber last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It establishes a long-term scheme in which a land fund will be seeded from appropriations for 10 years but will thereafter be sustained by its own investment income forever. The fund will be used for the acquisition and management of land for and by indigenous communities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government committed $200 million to the fund in the 1994-95 budget, and the bill commits a further $121 million in each of the next nine years. The annual amount available from the fund for land acquisition and management, at $45 million, is more than double the amount currently available to ATSIC for those purposes. An Indigenous Land Corporation, established by this legislation, will direct and administer all aspects of the distribution of the land fund moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the government's bill is unambiguous. It is to enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage and maintain it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for themselves and for future generations of their peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was drafted carefully to ensure that these basic objectives would and could be pursued uncompromisingly by the ILC. It was deliberately worded to give the ILC sufficient flexibility to operate effectively in the land market on the one hand and to meet the land needs of indigenous people on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is not directed at anything else on the policy or program agenda in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. This bill is for the single purpose of building and sustaining an adequate stock of land in the hands of indigenous owners currently dispossessed. I hope that the integrity of its approach will remain intact after the Senate, in due course, has a second opportunity to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the government has accepted a number of amendments proposed by the Senate but believes some others would so seriously undermine the central principles of the legislation that the government cannot accept them. I will not detain the House with a discussion of each individual amendment. The government does not believe that the amendments accepted by the government in the Senate, with the exception of one sensible proposal put forward by the Democrats, do anything to really improve the bill. Some actually will make the task of the ILC a little more complicated but, as I have said, we accepted them in the interests of obtaining broad support for the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reached a point, however, beyond which any further accommodation by the government would have jeopardised the viability of the Indigenous Land Corporation and the land fund. Those amendments which the government cannot accept are essentially those which we believe are wrong in principle or would make the legislation unworkable in practice, or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example of the first category, the coalition and the Greens would jeopardise the very purpose of the legislation through the combined effect of two sets of amendments. In one&mdash;amendments numbered 6 to 17 in the document I have tabled&mdash;they would have the ILC allow individuals and trusts to own property acquired through the land fund. This government, like previous governments, believes holdings by indigenous corporations best reflect traditional forms of land ownership, and also provide more reliable guarantees of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other, No. 32, the coalition and Green senators would allow grantees of land fund acquisitions to dispose of them at any time without the consent of the ILC. This proposition alone militates against the central aim of building up an indigenous land base and maintaining it for future generations. When combined with the relaxation of the requirement about the form of ownership, it has the real potential to undermine the very purpose of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined amendments give individuals as well as community organisations the legal entitlement to sell off land acquired through the fund. While it is unlikely that communities would sell out their own future generations, it is more likely that individuals, given the legal entitlement, would sell their land. Likely or not, it is possible and the legislation surely should not open up the possibility of undermining its own purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original bill provides adequately for special circumstances in which indigenous communities do have a case for disposing of land acquired through the land fund. Their corporations may sell or mortgage the land provided they have the ILC's consent, section 191S, or they may surrender the land to the ILC, section 191T. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate's argument for individual tenure is that, in their dealings with land, indigenous people should have the same rights, including the freedom to dispose of property, as all other Australians. But this argument is spurious because indigenous people do have those same rights. As individuals they can go and buy land like anyone else. The acquisitions envisaged by the bill are a commitment made by the Australian people over and above those individual rights and are for the specific purpose of restoring part of a lost heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the Senate's unacceptable approach is amendment No. 25. It would require the ILC to take into account, in a completely unspecified way, the educational, health and similar needs of indigenous communities when deciding where to acquire land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would shift the focus of the ILC's operations from the fundamental objective of building an indigenous land base. It would require the corporation to pursue objectives which are clearly the function of other agencies in all tiers of government. Inevitably, there would be confusion about the proper role of the ILC and about its responsibilities relative to those of agencies delivering services&mdash;not land&mdash;to indigenous communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments seeking to confuse the real objective of the ILC with other questions like health and education are also in another category of amendment which the government finds objectionable. These are the amendments calculated to make the day-to-day operations of the ILC unworkable at the same time as fostering disputation which would inevitably lead to many cases of administrative challenge and litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the coalition-Green amendments fall into this category. Whereas the government's bill was drafted to give a reasonable degree of discretion and flexibility to the corporation, the amendments seek to tie its hands with prescriptive formulas to be applied to its decision making at every turn. An example of this approach is the coalition's amendment No. 4, which proposes that, when making decisions on land acquisition, the ILC should give priority to those communities who are `most severely dispossessed'. The potential for conflict and for lengthy delays while disputes are settled should have been obvious to the proponents of that criterion from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that even the coalition-Green majority on the Senate select committee was struck by the amount of criticism this proposal drew from indigenous organisations and individuals. The committee was told time and time again that all indigenous people were dispossessed and that it was futile to try to draw distinctions between levels of dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's solution, however&mdash;a form of words which would still seek to rank degrees of disadvantage in terms of access to land&mdash;clearly fails to overcome the objection to the original amendment. Any statutory obligation to calculate and calibrate different degrees of disadvantage is bound to generate unproductive disputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several other amendments would have a similar damaging effect on the workability of the land fund scheme. These include the requirement for the ILC to consult traditional owners before purchasing any land, more onerous provisions related to the development of national and regional strategies, and a separate financial allocation for the ILC's administrative expenses. Government ministers explained in great detail in the Senate the difficulties that would be caused by these amendments, and these arguments still hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments I have mentioned specifically do not exhaust the list of those that cause the government concern. There are in addition, for example, those relating to the composition of the ILC board&mdash;amendment Nos 33 and 35&mdash;and those imposing an obligation not to retain certain interests in land, amendment No. 27. Again, the government's position on these matters was fully explained in the Senate debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the confused and contradictory outcomes of the Senate's deliberations grew out of the way in which the bill was approached in that place. We had the coalition, clearly devoid of any policy of its own, bending to the various demands of groups&mdash;any group it could find&mdash;who were opposed to this or that detail of the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember, the bill had been on the table of this House since 30 June last year. Before that, the bill had been drafted in consultation with a variety of indigenous organisations&mdash;including some who disagreed with parts of our proposals and who later briefed our opponents. Yet by October-November our opponents had failed to produce a coherent response. Instead of putting thoughtful alternatives to our proposals we saw them looking for excuses to sabotage a major legislative achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that after one of the longest debates ever held in the Senate our opponents found it necessary to send a select committee off on a whistlestop tour of the country. The select committee's mission was to find out after the event whether the amendments proposed by the Senate were acceptable to any sort of cross-section of the indigenous community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the Senate select committee found a great deal of opposition to a number of the amendments. What is surprising&mdash;astonishing&mdash;is that having expressly acknowledged the strength of that opposition, the select committee recommended that the disputed amendments remain in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, this episode reveals the double standards of the coalition and Green senators who made up the majority of that select committee. It was they who accused the government of inadequate consultation, despite the fact that our consultation and negotiation process on the land fund began during the formulation of the Native Title Act. In relation to the specifics of this particular bill, negotiations started in April last year&mdash;and the bill was not debated, even in this House, until the end of August. The same people, having consulted hurriedly after they acted in the parliament, then chose to ignore the outcome of their consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The double standards are self-evident. As I have already indicated, if the bill now before us is, like its predecessor, wrecked in the Senate, then those in that chamber who force that action will jeopardise the whole concept of a land fund. The Senate must take a more rational and reasonable approach to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are adopting this approach to the disagreement between the houses because the government wants this legislation. The majority of indigenous people want the legislation, and all of them deserve to have the legislation with the wholehearted support of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the coalition parties were in a state of total confusion in the area of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs when this bill was before the parliament last year. The then Leader of the Opposition, winking and nodding at the reactionaries of his Western Australian branch, had suggested that a coalition government would `review' the Native Title Act itself. He went straight from Perth to central Australia where he revealed to Aboriginal communities that not only was he ambivalent in his support for native title, he also lacked a grasp of his own party's policies on indigenous affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the climate of confusion and mistrust created by the then leader was a factor in what his colleagues subsequently did. Certainly, the damage done to the bill by the coalition, in league with the Western Australian Greens, is not consistent with a thought-out policy position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) therefore has a real opportunity here. He can demonstrate leadership and a genuine belief in tolerance. He can defy the bigoted and myopic. He can show us that he does have a truly national outlook. I am sure his spokesperson sitting at the table, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), would appreciate an opportunity to revisit the bill with her leader and other colleagues in a calmer, saner atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has the opportunity to redirect his colleagues in the Senate and insist that they enable the national parliament to deliver to the indigenous people of Australia&mdash;to all the people of Australia&mdash;what we on this side of the House think is a momentous measure of social justice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important when bills are attacked by people from outside who have not understood the whole context of our refugee program that they look at the total program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 offers us a perfect opportunity to canvas some of the many issues in the areas of refugee policy and immigration administration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his maiden speech a few weeks ago I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) talk about the Fraser government's proud record on Indo-Chinese refugees. Malcolm Fraser recognised that Australia, having fought in the Vietnam war, had a responsibility to its defeated allies and should take in as many refugees fleeing from the new and oppressive regime as was practicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, Gough Whitlam, with the mix of paranoia and petulant bombast that characterised his brief period in office, is said to have complained in the party room of `Vietnamese Balts with all their social and religious prejudices against us', which was sweetly prefixed by an old Anglo-Saxon obscenity. Labor leaders and ministers today, of course, are a little different; they are smug and snide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the coalition decided not to oppose this bill, it was no surprise that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) put out a media release full of talk of backdowns and backflips, with ironic praise for `taking a responsible position', for `protecting the Australian taxpayer from a potential windfall in compensation payouts to boat people' and not `putting tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars at risk'. But it was typically smug for a minister in this arrogant and complacent government to make such comments when the Bureau of Immigration Research estimated four years ago that its inability to enforce its own migration regulations in just the area of visa overstaying directly costs the government between $30 million and $60 million a year in benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was typical for a Keating Labor minister to speak of risking public moneys when the Auditor-General reported last financial year that this problem could cost as much as $190 million every year if we assume that illegal workers displace those entitled to hold jobs but are forced onto unemployment benefits. When we are talking about wasting public funds, we will do well to remember that this bill has only been made necessary because of the poor drafting of legislation and the faulty legal advice that this legislation was predicated on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lawyers for the Cambodians involved in this matter have already made it clear that they will have no choice but to take their case to the High Court if this bill becomes law and the government refuses to offer any settlement. The lawyers have said that they feel confident that the High Court will find the legislation unconstitutional and strike it down. We had better hope that the government has had the right legal advice this time otherwise, despite what the minister says, we will be set to pay out tens of millions of dollars in legal fees and compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has presided over an unprecedented politicisation of the public service. The old Westminster traditions of providing independent advice without fear or favour have gone; instead, a very different kind of fear and favour abounds. Now, rather than getting the legal advice that they should receive, ministers are given the opinions that their bureaucrats believe they will find more useful. Public servants are confused about whether their loyalties lie with the current government or to the wider concept of community interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Bureau of Immigration Research conference in Adelaide was told that the 1989 rewriting of the government's immigration legislation was passed in a hurry so that it could be in force before the 1990 election, and that most of the problems that have already led to it being amended 20 times have been caused by the law being introduced prematurely. Today's bill is a typical product of a government in decline. It is the product of a complacent government that presents the parliament and the public with sloppy legislation and poorly drafted documents. It comes from a minister who stands condemned for cronyism and who, along with his colleagues, continually tries to circumvent the checks and balances that parliament applies to executive power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has major problems with immigration and refugee policies and their administration, and the minister himself is one of the greatest of these problems.

The minister has failed on both these grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposed the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 when it was introduced last year because of its retrospectivity. We were joined by the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine in the Senate and blocked the passage of the bill in that chamber early in November. The bill has now been introduced again but this time we will not be opposing the legislation. This does not mean that we are not concerned about the retrospective nature of the government's proposal. Retrospective legislation should always be a cause for very careful consideration, if not, in many cases, actual disquiet. Instead, we have looked at the events that have happened in the months since the bill originally came before the parliament for debate. It is important to examine some of these in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past six years, around 1,700 people from Asian countries have arrived illegally in Australia by boat. Almost half of these arrived during 1994, and, since June, nine boats bearing more than 700 people from the southern Chinese port city of Beihai landed at Darwin in the biggest influx since the waves of the Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s. Many of these boats were large, solid fishing vessels. Rather than braving the seas in coastal craft, these refugees came in boats equipped with twin diesels and advanced satellite navigation systems.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in June, all 50 people on the first boat from Beihai were accepted as refugees. The later arrivals looked more like part of a well-organised scheme, attracted by that news as well as outlandish rumours that Australia was accepting boat people because it needed labourers to build the facilities for the Sydney Olympic Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few months Darwin residents have seen boats slip past Coastwatch and arrive on suburban beaches. Motorists have been flagged down by groups of recent arrivals and asked for directions to police stations. It is little wonder that Top Enders have felt besieged. It is also not surprising that people throughout the country have been concerned by the failure of our coastal protection and warning systems and by the messages sent out by our refugee schemes to some would-be candidates for entry to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the week after Christmas the minister was dragged into the office and forced into action by overwhelming public concern. A departmental team was despatched to Beijing and administrative measures were announced. The People's Republic of China is scarcely the most honourable of governments to deal with&mdash;there has been considerable concern in the past over possible corroboration by corrupt authorities with immigration racketeers&mdash;but the minister's belated intervention appears to have changed some things at an official level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Embassy in Beijing has reported that Chinese authorities have conducted public meetings to inform would-be boat people of Australia's strong stand against giving them refuge. It has increased the number of shore patrols which, we hear, have stopped five more boatloads of would-be refugees in only the first six weeks of this year. In an environment like that it is no surprise that the coalition has had to give careful consideration to its response to this bill now that it has been reintroduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of concern over the whole issue of boat people. Ethnic community leaders have expressed concern over possible migration queue jumping by people with dubious claims to refugee status. Since the coalition made its original decision there has been growing community concern over the notion of rewarding, for want of a better word, illegal immigrants with compensation, and there has been increasing disquiet over the many people who arrive on our shores by boat, claiming to be genuine refugees when all the prima facie evidence suggests otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By deciding not to oppose this legislation we are responding to changed circumstances. We are responding to these clear community views that the government, despite its mistakes, should not have to pay compensation to people who have arrived in this country illegally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian liberals should be proud of the humane way the Fraser government reacted to the first Indo-Chinese refugee crisis. If we want to make sure that Australia will still be prepared to receive genuine refugees in the future it is important to make sure that public opinion will not turn against these programs because of the admission of people with less than genuine claims to refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, despite its concern over the retrospective elements, is not opposing this legislation. However, that does not mean that we will let up for one minute in our attack on this government and Senator Bolkus for the way the refugee and immigration policy has been handled. As I have already said, today's debate has been brought about by the policy failures of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has decided not to oppose this bill only because of the community concern arising from the new refugee crisis other government failures have brought on. To place it in its proper context and to get a true perspective of the extent of these failures, we need to consider it in the light of the government's overall record on immigration policy administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us compare one group with refugees. In the last six months of 1994, 700 boat people arrived. Each year around 14,000 legal arrivals overstay their visas. I have already mentioned the cost involved here: $30 million, $60 million or as high as $190 million, depending on how we look at the problem. Boat people entering Australia are detained. People who arrive legally and then overstay are given bridging visas&mdash;if they are caught, that is&mdash;that can still allow them to work or receive benefits illegally while their status is determined. It could be said that an entirely discriminatory system that imposes significant costs on the Australian taxpayer is in operation here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said today, this debate is a product of bad legal advice and poorly drafted legislation. A new refugee wave, created in part by the mixed messages this government has sent out, has been instrumental in influencing the coalition's response to this recent amended legislation. Yet the minister has waited until the situation has reached crisis point before acting firmly to stop the matter. One can only speculate on Senator Bolkus's priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become public knowledge over recent months that the minister wanted the removal of as many as 20 people from the speaker's list at the population outlook conference that the Bureau for Immigration, Multicultural and Population Research held in Adelaide last week, a figure finally reduced to six when the impracticability of this course of action sank in. Interestingly enough for this debate, one of those people purged from the conference was Ms Margaret Piper from the Refugee Council of Australia. Is this how the minister deals with views opposed to his own?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In disinviting the speakers, the bureau was forced to claim the minister had required changes to the conference format. However, the Monash University Centre for Population and Urban Research pointed out in the December issue of its publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">People and Places</EMPHASIS> that in the case of at least two of the disinvited speakers there was no change to the format of the original program other than to replace them with another speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is grotesque for a minister to be punishing and silencing his critics. It becomes farcical when we see him doing it in such a ham-fisted way. Under Senator Bolkus the situation has arisen where we need to seriously question the administration of immigration policy in this country. It is bad enough that the actual laws and regulations themselves contain so many loopholes or ambiguities because their implementation was rushed so a government could parade them at election time that they are in need of constant amendment. But when blatant censorship and ministerial cronyism occurs, then there is real cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appeals by would-be refugees against departmental rulings are heard by the Refugee Review Tribunal. For other immigration applicants, appeals are heard by the Immigration Review Tribunal, a supposedly independent body set up in 1989 to review the merits of decisions made by the department of immigration and with the power to have those overturned. At the moment, there is no question over the integrity of the decisions of the Refugee Review Tribunal. It is just as well when we can see quite clearly today some of the results of disputes over refugee regulations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very important, indeed, to ensure that we have a reasoned debate about this, something the opposition has conspicuously failed to do. What it has done is oppose every single measure that is designed to improve the lot of Aboriginal people. It has been opposed to Mabo. We had the former Leader of the Opposition earlier today catering to the worst sentiment in my own state and opposing proper legislation to support the Mabo decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But it would seem to me that the wrong way to go about improving the circumstances of Aboriginal people is to denigrate them, deny them access to land and destroy the services that are provided for them. The Prime Minister made a very genuine point in that interview. I saw the interview and the transcript. In the context, what the Prime Minister said was that the funds that we have applied in Aboriginal affairs have not had the desired effect that we would all wish. That is true. That has been acknowledged by a wide range of commentators. I want to point out that this serious matter requires cooperation; it requires bipartisan support. Most of these services that are required to be provided, whether water supply, electricity, sewerage or health services, are the responsibility of state and territory governments, assisted by national policy from the federal government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Theophanous decision was an extremely important one which extended the High Court's earlier decisions regarding the implied freedom in the Australian Constitution, freedom which the court has developed in earlier decisions regarding free expression in political matters and public affairs. It was a decision which was greeted at the time with enthusiasm particularly by the media with some justification in that Australian defamation laws as they are currently written are tilted too much in favour of personal reputation and not enough in terms of allowing free public debate. However, any belief which may be taken from that decision or from comment at that time that the decision has in fact introduced an American style of defamation law in this country is quite mistaken and any examination of the decision will show that.</PARA></TALK.START>

Such allegations should not be taken under the High Court decision to be open game or freely available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though there was great discussion in the High Court on the leading United States defamation case, New York Times v Sullivan&mdash;the case which establishes in United States law that actual malice or recklessness or disregard of the truth must be established by a plaintiff bringing a defamation action&mdash;the High Court decision specifically rejected that approach. Indeed, in the Theophanous case, once the falsity of a statement was established and it was defamatory, it would then be up to the defendant to establish, firstly, that the defendant was unaware of the falsity of the material that was published; secondly, that it did not publish the material recklessly&mdash;that is, not caring whether the material was true or false&mdash;and, thirdly, that the publication was reasonable in the circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to his announcement last week of a package of measures to reduce fringe benefits tax compliance costs, and I ask: is the Treasurer aware of criticisms of the increase in the formula for calculating employer provided cars, which is part of that package? Can the Treasurer advise the House of the reasons for the increase in the car formula?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1119" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case, as the member for Eden-Monaro says, that I announced a package of fringe benefits tax compliance cost reductions last Friday and, in addition, announced a couple of other changes to the tax which I think significantly improve it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the compliance cost reduction is quite an important element of tax policy to try to ensure that those who have to pay any tax can do so at minimal cost to themselves in terms of complying with their requirements under that tax. In order to achieve that, we have taken out various items from FBT altogether&mdash;such items as laptop and portable computers, protective clothing, briefcases, calculators, tools of trade, subscriptions to trade and professional journals, airport lounge memberships, business related software, electronic diaries, and corporate credit card membership fees. All these things supplied by employers to their employees will no longer require attempts to try to assess what the private benefit was from those items and to apply FBT to it. In addition, car phones and mobile phones will not be subject to FBT where private use is only minor or incidental to the primary business use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Eden-Monaro mentioned, the package will also allow a much greater use of a statutory formula for calculating benefits subject to FBT and other measures which will greatly reduce record keeping requirements. These changes will dramatically reduce the compliance costs associated with the FBT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those compliance cost changes, I announced two other changes. One was to allow FBT exemption for taxis provided between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. for direct journeys between work and home. That was in response to a large number of requests for consideration to be given for that in order for employers to look after the safety of their employees, and we accepted that. And also in relation to car parking we have removed most car parking benefits in non-CBD areas. Any employer who is not within a kilometre of a commercial car park charging more than $5 a day will no longer be liable for FBT on that benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That basically will confine the FBT in very large part to CBD areas; in other words, concentrating on fairly high value benefits rather than including a lot of smaller ones. The effect of that is that a large number of employers will now be completely exempted from liability for FBT on the car parking benefit, and many will be exempted from the FBT in entirety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention, as the questioner raised the point, that the cost of all this is $120 million in the first year and $90 million thereafter. That is essentially the cost of meeting the car parking and taxi changes. To cover that cost we have increased the statutory formula for calculation of the fringe benefits tax for the use of a car which is available to employees or employers to use, instead of having their employees keep records. The modest increase in this formula will reduce the concessionality that now exists in that formula, which is a widely recognised concessionality. That is, by using the formula you can get a much lower FBT cost to the companies than would be the case if they kept records and paid FBT on the private use. So it is concessional. It is widely seen as that. By some increase in it, we are reducing that concessionality and covering the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is overall a very sensible package and was seen as such by various commentators, although it was criticised by some, including of course the opposition, particularly through the shadow Treasurer and through the shadow minister for small business, the member for Pearce, who criticised the increase in the formula and said it had no rationale except to raise money.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not true. As I have said, there is a concessionality in that which is quite substantial. This was  spelt out in some considerable detail in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> on 15 August last year. I will quote a couple of excerpts from that article headed `How to save tax with company cars':</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Executives are recognising that the company car is one of the last great havens from the tough new fringe benefits tax . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">             . . .          . . .          . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remuneration consultancy firm Cullen Egan Dell, whose database covers 700 companies, reports that even before the latest executive salary negotiations, 15% of chief executives had a second company car, compared with 5% of senior executives and 3% of middle management. Consultants say these percentages are expected to rise rapidly in the next six to 12 months, as companies revise their remuneration policies in response to the new FBT laws . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere in the article it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some senior executives are even taking third company cars. At least one Australian chief executive has five company cars: a large family car for himself, a small Korean runabout for his spouse and second-hand cars for each of his three children.</PARA>
<PARA>And the opposition says there is no rationale for this change in the concessionality of this element of the fringe benefits tax; that it is simply a tax raising measure! Those opposite think it is fine for there to be this kind of loophole and for people in well-paid positions to be able to get these large fringe benefits in a way which is only very lightly taxed under the present arrangements. They think that is fine; that there is no rationale for increasing this at all; that we should let these loopholes continue. The article also states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Company vehicles deliver valuable tax breaks because the FBT legislation allows for company cars to be valued for FBT at a fraction of their real value, even when never driven on business. No other benefit subject to FBT enjoys such privileged treatment.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is no doubt whatsoever that the formula that pre-existed my announcement was a highly concessional formula. By raising that formula we have reduced that concessionality. It is still concessional. It is still certainly attractive to use it instead of keeping detailed records, but it does reduce the concessionality. It pays for the other very worthwhile changes&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue raised by the honourable member is, indeed, a serious one for world financial markets involving the collapse of a major British bank, Barings, in circumstances which are now well known to every member in the House. In responding to this question it is appropriate to say at the outset that, so far as we can gather, the failure of Barings is not likely to have any significant, direct implications for Australia. Barings has only a small presence in the Australian financial markets. It has part ownership of the corporate adviser Baring Brothers Burrows and owns 20 per cent of the stockbrokers McIntosh. While Barings' interest in both bodies may well need to be sold, this is not expected to have any significant impact on the business or financial standing of either body.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of derivatives is an increasingly common feature of financial markets around the world. They are essentially financial products designed to enable the better management of risks related to the future price of commodities or other financial instruments. Banks account for around 90 per cent of derivatives trading in Australia, but there are three regulatory bodies involved with derivatives. Not only are banks involved&mdash;and of course the Reserve Bank is the regulatory body there&mdash;but also superannuation funds and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission are involved in the regulation of that area, and there is also the general use of derivatives by companies and the Australian Securities Commission is involved in relation to that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RBA's approach to regulation is to ensure that banks have appropriate internal management systems and limit risks to prudent levels and that is in line with the international approach to the regulation of derivatives. The regulation of derivatives has attracted a lot of attention worldwide in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been studies by the Group of 30&mdash;a private sector group of eminent persons in the financial area from various developed countries&mdash;the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of England and the US authorities. These studies have generally concluded that the primary responsibility for the prudent management of a firm with derivatives operations lies with the management and board of the firm itself and that the regulator cannot be expected to take on that burden. These studies have also suggested guidelines for best practice in the management of derivatives and have stressed the need for regulators to be vigilant in ensuring firms have adequate risk management systems in place and that these systems adapt to the rapidly changing nature of financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, Australian institutions have a good record on derivatives trading, and losses have been very small relative to the value of derivatives transactions undertaken. The RBA reviews banks' derivatives management systems against international best practice. In its bulletin of September last year, a discussion of Australian banks' activities in the market and their risk management practices was provided. Whenever it has identified any derivative management practices which could be improved, the bank has taken up that issue with individual banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Barings issue, the Reserve Bank will receive a report from the Bank of England of its analysis of the Barings collapse and will evaluate current Australian arrangements in light of that analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of derivatives by the insurance and superannuation industries is increasing from relatively low levels. In response to this development, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission has been working for some time on prudent guidelines for derivatives and will shortly be releasing the results of its work for discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the Australian Securities Commission has proposed an Australian accounting standard dealing with such financial instruments. Following the Barings collapse, the ASC has called for corporate managers to support the development of a voluntary code to meet true and fair disclosure requirements pending the finalisation of the standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I can say in the circumstances that the various regulatory bodies are all addressing this issue with substantial vigour. Of course, we can give no assurances that there will be no collapse of any operator involved with derivatives. The risks are, in the end, essentially ones that they undertake. The banks and other regulatory bodies are concerned to ensure that the risks taken are prudent risks, so far as regulators can bring that about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that there are people on both sides of the House who will be interested in whether or not there will be coverage of the West Indies tour on free to air TV in particular. In fact the Minister for Finance was raising this issue, interrogating me very closely on the way down here, and I suspect if he cannot actually be part of the commentary team he is very keen to at least have a chance to watch the events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last July Australis announced that it believed it had secured exclusive rights to the series. However, it subsequently advised the Broadcasting Authority and myself that in fact an associated company, Prime Sports, held the rights and that in accordance with the anti-siphoning rules and the Broadcasting Services Act its pay TV licensee company would only secure those rights after a free to air broadcaster had got the free to air rights. In January Australis then told us that its company had in fact secured the rights and that it believed that it was not bound to abide by the rules. It claimed that its company had secured the rights before the siphoning list took effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting aside for one moment the question as to whether the broadcasting authority and I were misled by Australis in its contradictory statements, pay TV was always intended to increase the diversity of programming. Pay TV was never intended to force Australian viewers to pay to watch sporting events that they have traditionally seen for free. The parliament's clear intention in the Broadcasting Services Act has been to ensure that sport does not migrate from free to air to pay, and that is certainly the government's view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Senator Alston, the opposition spokesman on this issue, has said that my list is too long, that he thinks I have protected too many sporting events and that I have undermined the viability of pay TV, but that is just the difference between the government and the opposition. We think that the viewers out there should still continue to have access to those sporting events. It is no secret that, despite the fact that there have been negotiations between Channel 9 and Australis off and on since January, but mostly off&mdash;</PARA>

Channel 9 initially asked for 24 hours exclusivity. I, as the Leader of the National Party intimated, did intervene about 10 days ago to try to suggest that Channel 9 give ground and accept 12 hours of exclusivity, which would have allowed Channel 9 to have the live coverage at night and for the pay TV operator to replay the events at prime time in the afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is a concession which Australis granted in the Senate committee appearances last week. Australis made it clear that this is the only event where there will be an argument about whether or not it secured these rights before the siphoning list was finalised. On that basis, I think there is room for compromise on both sides to try to reach agreement so Australian fans out there can get a chance to watch this cricket event. That, of course, is the highest priority for those on this side of the House, even though the opposition thinks that all sport can go to pay TV and be unavailable to the free to air viewers out there.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two reports which I am sure will interest members, one of which is from the International Narcotics Control Board. It is part of our United Nations obligations to provide data to that body about drug seizures in the region. That report shows that, unfortunately, we still have very substantial and, indeed, in some cases growing problems in the region, including Australia. It is important for members to note that countries in our region are increasingly becoming transit points and risk becoming centres for laundering profits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have an environment in which our young people, particularly, are likely to be subject to increased pressure. We have seen increases&mdash;or reports of increases&mdash;in heroin abuse and cocaine abuse; increases in some very strong forms of marijuana; and abuse of amphetamines, particularly the hallucinogenic derivative MDMA. That view from the INCB report is confirmed by a report from my own department entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Statistics on drug abuse in Australia</EMPHASIS> which paints a similar picture in relation to illicit drug abuse and drug use. It is particularly worrying that the report says&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although prone to fluctuations death rates due to illicit drugs have increased by six per cent over the period 1988 to 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is worth saying, however, that a lot of effort has been put into this issue by responsible ministers&mdash;not just health ministers, but by justice and police ministers. The International Narcotics Control Board had this to say about Australia's anti-drug effort:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Demand reduction efforts have continued in a systematic way in Australia. The board appreciates the balanced approach being followed in Australia and cooperation efforts involving health and law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the problem is still a very serious one and we cannot step back from it, I think we have some reason to be pleased with that cooperative effort. The Commonwealth and state agencies involved deserve some credit for curtailing a very serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that, although we continue to have problems with illicit drug use, my own department's work shows that, in licit areas, alcohol consumption per person has fallen 13 per cent&mdash;although medium and high risk drinking is still a problem; hence our Alcohol Go Easy campaign. Tobacco, of course, is still the major cause of preventable drug related mortality, but again we have seen total consumption falling 25 per cent. I think it is very important that all members understand the problem that we face and work with those agencies to prevent any deterioration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that this is something likely to excite passions on the other side generally, but let's look this in the face. In Australia we have an excellent record of dealing with HIV-AIDS&mdash;an excellent record, the envy of the world. One of the reasons we have been so successful in containing the spread of that disease is that we faced it squarely and frankly. We have not pretended that certain practices were not occurring and we have not taken a morally superior line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has, in the past, been a bipartisan approach. State and Commonwealth governments, Liberal and Labor, have said, `Let's address the problem. Let's not get sidetracked by the fact that we know there are varieties of opinion and varieties of moral positions in this community.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's face the fact, for example&mdash;if you want to talk about anal that in terms of absolute numbers more women will have anal sex than will homosexual couples. In percentage terms, certainly, the number is lower, but absolutely speaking, given all the surveys that have been done on this question&mdash;those opposite might want to duck it&mdash;at any time, anywhere between 10 and 15 per cent of women&mdash;or heterosexual couples&mdash;will have anal sex. I could say, as minister, `I don't want to know about that. I don't think we should tell young people about the risks they are taking if they have anal sex.' I prefer to take the view that they need to be informed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What all the evidence shows very clearly is that if people are informed, and informed in a way that they can accept and understand&mdash;remember who we are talking to, 18- to 35-year-olds, young adults&mdash;they are less likely to be sexually active. People who are informed delay sexual gratification, delay their entry into relationships and are less likely to experiment with unsafe sex practices.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1128" SPEAKER="Kerr The Hon D.J.C." NAMEID="RH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DENISON" MINISTERIAL="JUSTICE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for the question. I think I should begin by responding to a couple of things that are not affected by Mr Bond's discharge from bankruptcy. Firstly, nothing affects the fact that Mr Bond is currently facing criminal charges under the Western Australian Companies Code, alleging that he and others acted dishonestly, as officers of Bell Resources Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I should point out that nothing in his discharge affects the Australian Federal Police's continuing investigation into the possible commission by Mr Bond of criminal offences under the Bankruptcy Act by failing to fully disclose his assets and properties to the trustee of his bankrupt estate. The significance of that, of course, is that if Mr Bond is subsequently found to have failed to have fully and adequately disclosed those resources, not only would he face the possibility of further criminal charges but also the release that he has obtained from his bankruptcy could be re-opened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is no doubt that members of this House, and certainly the government, are well aware of community concerns over the size of Mr Bond's offer to creditors to accept less than 1c in the dollar, but that decision is properly, under our bankruptcy laws, one for his creditors alone. It is not the role of government to supersede that of the large banks and the other large financial institutions to which Mr Bond owed money. At the end of the day, the question of every bankruptcy is for those owed the money, and to secure a release there must be a vote of not less than 50 per cent of the number of those owed and not less than 75 per cent of the value of the debts owed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard some criticisms in recent days that amount to the proposition that there should be a fundamental re-writing of the principles that underpin our bankruptcy laws. I want to reject that entirely, because there are two things we seek to do with bankruptcy law: firstly, to provide the full resources necessary to allow trustees in bankruptcy to clawback assets that are held by bankrupts and to make them available to creditors; but, secondly, also to make sure that the many people who come before bankruptcy procedures have a chance to make a fresh start and to put behind them their bankruptcy processes. That is, of course, so important because so many of those who try to set up small businesses in our community do so taking an acknowledged risk. Not everybody who starts up business in this community succeeds, and there has to be a proper process that allows those who seek to enrich themselves in the private enterprise sector, but who fail, to set aside ultimately the burden of those debts and move on to a new life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have two objectives: firstly, to make sure that creditors are paid the moneys that are held by the bankrupt; and, secondly, that in the end, after that has been done, a bankrupt can move on. I reject entirely the sort of suggestions that have been made, I think bandied around by the Leader of the National Party, that we need to re-appraise those principles. It would be precisely the people in rural Australia, small business people and the like, who, if we approach this issue vindictively, without reflection about the second leg of the objective under the bankruptcy legislation, who would suffer most.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, and I think objective commentators would say, that Australia's bankruptcy laws are amongst the toughest and the fairest in the world. We have had substantial changes from time to time as reports have come to us, and there has been a substantial consultative process amongst those involved with insolvency and the community as a whole. The act underwent landmark reforms in 1991, and further reforms announced last year will be brought forward shortly. The 1991 amendments, for example, gave trustees significant power to overturn distributions of property which were intended to defraud creditors or payments by the bankrupt which favoured one creditor over another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the weapons that are given to trustees to enable funds and assets to be clawed back are in place, but at the end of the day the decision when to draw the line and to say that the investigations and the attempts to collect assets from a debtor have been exhausted is one for those who are owed the money. That is not to say that this government has been insensitive to Mr Ramsay in the requests that have been made of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act a trustee in bankruptcy can approach the Minister for Justice for assistance if needed to finance some components of an investigation. Twice that has occurred and twice this government has responded positively and thoroughly to those requests. We have given substantial financial assistance to the trustee in bankruptcy to support his investigations in relation to Mr Bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to comment briefly on some criticisms that have been made, I think, by Mr Gavin Rezos, the legal counsel for the Hong Kong bank, that the clawback provision be extended from the maximum period of five years that now exists to ten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just by way of background information, the way clawback works now is, essentially, that there is a normal period which extends only to five years if the person has been insolvent at the time when a debt was entered into. But if a debt was entered into knowingly with the intention to defraud creditors, then it can be traced back at any time. To suggest that we go back 10 years, whilst it sounds superficially attractive, and apply that, without any safeguards of the kind that I think need to be built into this legislative provision, and the kinds that are, would be immensely unfair to many ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider, for example, the small business person who gives a daughter or son a gift for their wedding&mdash;a new vehicle or something of that kind&mdash;and nine years later their business goes bankrupt, through no fault of their own, and the creditors reach back and seek to claim that asset. Any system that reaches back 10 years in those kinds of circumstances, as some people are proposing, I think, is a vindictive and unhelpful response to this whole debate. Whilst every suggestion that is put forward constructively needs to be looked at, I hesitate to approach this on the basis of a knee-jerk reaction to a particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I make this point: Mr Bond has said, in response to those proceedings that were taken against him, that his creditors would have been better off if there were a provision under Australian law which was akin to chapter 11 of the United States insolvency law. Such a provision currently exists under the Australian Corporations Law. Part 5.3(a) of the Corporations Law commenced on 23 June 1993 and provides for voluntary administrations, which are as effective and as simple as those which exist under chapter 11 of the United States code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is not disposed to treat this issue lightly. It understands community concerns. It will continue to come before this parliament with whatever steps are necessary to improve the administration of the bankruptcy laws, but it will assure the Australian public that it has strong and effective laws in place and that the principles are correct.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As chair of the parliamentary banking, finance and public administration committee, he has a very keen interest in this issue, as I have. Consumers have raised many questions in recent months about the service they are getting from our banking system. So earlier this month I held a meeting with Australia's peak consumer and community groups, which the member for Calare also attended. We did that to discuss the impact of bank fees and bank closures on their constituents. Perhaps Mr Argus does not quite understand the depth of anger in the community and amongst consumers about the rising bank fees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports that Mr Argus has suggested that the banks' social responsibility is an issue for government alone. I can assure him that that was not the view of those present at the meeting. Indeed, it was a view of all those consumer and community groups represented that banks also have a definite social responsibility. The clear message was that all Australians have the right to access our banking system. Neither the government nor the consumer or community groups I met are advocating a return to the days of regulation but what the government is addressing, through the PSA inquiry in particular, is how we best work with the banks to meet consumer concerns about bank fees and charges. That does not mean that the banks can just pass the buck. It is worth noting that in France the banks addressed this issue and in 1992 adopted as an industry a basic banking services charter to ensure that all members of the community could still utilise the banking system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community groups and consumer groups tell me that that increasingly is not the case in Australia. Low income earners are finding that they simply cannot afford the rising bank fees, nor can they cope with diminishing access as a result of bank closures and so on. For instance, Chris Vevers from Disabled Peoples International said that it now costs some disabled people an extra $14 a month to use tellers because they cannot physically access ATMs and are forced to pay for personal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to see that the Commonwealth Bank has announced that it is going to address these concerns with the introduction of ATMs with access for disabled people. That shows that, when consumers put their views to the banks and we discuss these things together, some of these concerns can be addressed&mdash;but there is still a long way to go. I will be meeting with consumer groups again later this month to discuss further issues of access and the concept of a basic banking product.

Can you confirm that this is the case and can you advise whether this is the first occasion that this has occurred? I think it is fair to say that members on both sides of parliament are very concerned and disturbed at the interference by the court in the discharge by the Ombudsman of her statutory responsibilities to the parliament. Some members would assert, as I do, that the court has tripped over its responsibilities and a prima facie case of breach of privilege has been committed. I specifically ask whether you will examine the circumstances surrounding the injunction and determine whether, in your opinion, a breach of privilege has occurred, warranting a reference to the privileges committee. Further, do you deem it appropriate for the interests of all members of this House to be represented and protected at the hearing or will the Ombudsman be allowed to fend for herself at the hearing without the protection of parliament, and members' interests remain unrepresented?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of weeks ago I was under the house rummaging around looking for some material for a jumble sale. I came across a 1984 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>. Let me read from an article headed `Aboriginal children' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> 11 years ago:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Bourke, New South Wales, 26 young Aboriginal children out of a sample of over a hundred, had more than one episode of pneumonia during a 3 year period. Only 5 out of 167, or 3% of white children, had pneumonia in the same period.</PARA>
<PARA>The day after I found that 1984 edition the current edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>, dated 20 February 1995, turned up. It says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Central Australian Aboriginals have the highest incidence of invasive pneumonia reported in the world. The rate for children under 2 years is 59 to 80 times the rate for children in the US and Sweden.</PARA>
<PARA>The latter statement is 1995; the former statement is 1984; and nothing has changed in the 11 years in between. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get very angry because, if you look at what has been said about Aboriginal health over the years, we have had a lot of promises. In 1973 the Whitlam government made promises about Aboriginal health. It was going to have Aboriginal health equity by 1984. Then, as part of Labor's platform in the run-up to the 1983 election, Susan Ryan, who was then shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, had this to say about Labor's program for 1983:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A six-year program to house all those Aboriginals currently without adequate housing to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>That should have been fixed in 1989. Yet we have the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), only three weeks ago talking about the need in Aboriginal housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again we have had aims, promises, programs and projects, and the fact is that they have not worked. This is the history of Aboriginal health in the last decade: nothing has worked; promises have been made. We have failed time and again, and every time we fail it is that bit harder to succeed the next time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read from the Better Health Commission set up by the Labor Party 10 years ago. It reported in 1986. There is a section on Aboriginal health. This is what it said in 1986:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a starting point, there is clearly a need for a detailed analysis of the Aboriginal health status in the light of health rather than just medical health. Based on this type of detailed analysis, it would be possible to undertake some more precise policy and program analysis. Incorporated in these programs should be specific targets with deadlines. They would not enable just only monitoring but also the evaluation of the assumptions on which those programs are based.</PARA>
<PARA>Today I rang and spoke to a person who was on this commission&mdash;I will not give names. I asked, `What do you think about the Better Health Commission?', and was told, `I felt the exercise was more political than practical. I felt that we were to be seen to be doing something while the government was not actually doing anything at all.' That is 12 years of history in Aboriginal health&mdash;seen to be doing something while not doing anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to illustrate the complete neglect in Aboriginal health by using the example of HIV. I want to do this because three months ago I was in Uganda. I went out with an aid agency. I travelled in southern Uganda and I would like to tell the House what I saw. I was in the Rakai province of southern Uganda which is the world epicentre of AIDS. I was travelling in remote parts of the country and about 2 o'clock one afternoon I visited a mud and reed hut that had eight people in it. The oldest was 16, the youngest was two. They had no parents&mdash;both parents died two years ago. They had no possessions whatsoever. To enable me to sit down, they borrowed a stool from a neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their nearest living relative was two day's walk away. They had no food. The seven- and nine-year-old were out in the bush looking for food while I was there. In the Rakai province every sixth person is an orphaned child&mdash;not every sixth child but every sixth person. This is what HIV does when it gets into a susceptible community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Kenya within 18 months there will be 150,000 AIDS orphans and by the year 2000 there will be one million AIDS orphans. Nothing can be done to stop it. I ask honourable members to think what one million uneducated, unsocialised, hungry children on the streets of a country will do. I also ask them to think about the fact that every risk factor that exists in eastern Africa for HIV exists in central and remote communities right around the country. I have seen the future in Africa and I am scared. I have seen the future in Africa and I am very, very angry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was hoping the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) would be here today. She is the person who is trying to take responsibility for health away from ATSIC. I would have thought that, after her glib answers in question time today, she might have tried to come in here and demonstrate that she knew something about it&mdash;she might have tried to answer some questions. But I am happy to put them to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). Specifically, I would like to ask him 10 questions on HIV. I would be happy if he could answer one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question is: where is your strategic plan for HIV in Aboriginal communities? I will answer that one. You do not have one. The Australian National Council on AIDS, ANCA, does not have one and ATSIC does not have one, and we are 13 years into the epidemic in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is: where are you going to locate the responsibility for it&mdash;ATSIC, Health, ANCA? Again, 13 years into the epidemic and we do not know where responsibility is&mdash;not for health but specifically for HIV in relation to health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question is: what are the infrastructure issues to deliver HIV programs to Aboriginal people? You do not know because you have not looked into it. Fourth question: what are the HIV and STD surveillance issues? How are we going to overcome the resistance to testing? Thirteen years into the epidemic and we do not know the answers to these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifth question: what are the issues arising out of community concerns about confidentiality in the provision of surveillance? We do not know. Sixth question: what is the relationship between sexually transmitted diseases and HIV in Aboriginal people? We do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventh question: what are the issues arising from the geographic mobility of Aboriginal people? What are the appropriate models of care in the community for Aboriginal people with AIDS? How are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities going to deal with the issue of sex between men, and what impact will this have on our education programs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as a practical example: the Nunapa health showed as early as 1986 that 10 per cent of Aboriginal people in the Pitjantjatjara lands have dono virus. We do not have an optimal treatment protocol in Australia, let alone in the world. We do not know how to treat it best. Why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are 10 questions fundamental to AIDS prevention in Aboriginal communities. We cannot answer those questions in 1995. That is negligence. That is culpable behaviour. And this is the essence of why you keep failing. This is the essence of why your strategies do not work. Money alone is not going to fix things without the data on which to form opinions and to have some idea of whether your projects are working or not. Money is not going to work without a strategic vision. Money is not going to work without coordination. Above all, money is not going to work without leadership. The strategic vision, the coordination and the leadership have not been there in the threat that this poses to Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listen to the Minister for Human Services and Health and I hear her blame the states time and again. This is very curious because I actually dug up out of the parliamentary database her profile&mdash;and she was a state minister once. I will tell honourable members some things about the state of Western Australia. In 1992 Aboriginal persons in the south-west of Western Australia had a three per cent chance of finishing year 12. That is the lowest year 12 completion rate of any identifiable group of people in the Western world. And who was Minister for Education in Western Australia between 1988 and 1990? Who was Aboriginal affairs minister between 1989 and 1993? And who was Premier between 1990 and 1993? Carmen Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to hear how the minister can blame the states and explain a three per cent year 12 completion rate amongst Aborigines in the south-west of Western Australia. I want to see how she can blame the states. The fact is that any Aboriginal community in the Western Desert, and there are nine of them, had between a 25 per cent and 40 per cent incidence of sexually transmitted diseases&mdash;that is not ever; that is at any one point in time&mdash;when she was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, when she was Premier, and when I visited in 1992 when she was both. So, if she is going to blame the states, she has to explain why she failed in Western Australia and why she has come here to do the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another answer that Labor will give is, `Look, we changed the administration. That fixes it. We will shift it over from ATSIC to Health and everything will be all right,' although there are some differences of opinion on the other side of the House about that. The fact is that changing the administration will not make a jot of difference if the fundamental problems of coordination, vision and leadership are not changed. Without those three, we can throw in another half a billion dollars and it will vanish. They are the things that in 12 years of Labor it has been unable to come to grips with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sat in question time today and listened to the Minister for Human Services and Health talk about Aboriginal affairs. She has actually talked about it twice before in the House. Both times I think she has thought she was in state parliament, not federal parliament. She talked about a newly discovered interest on the part of the coalition. When she was Premier, I was shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. I was out working, albeit shortly but in a voluntary capacity, as a doctor in a remote Aboriginal community, to find out what it was like. I was doing evacuation of sick kids at night&mdash;and I take offence at the notion of a newly discovered interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that we have not made any attempt to do anything other than make political mileage, that everything has been division. The minister opposite knows ATSIC operated in its early years with a very bipartisan approach. The Aboriginal health strategy, the Aboriginal education strategy and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody all had a very bipartisan approach. Given the way things have panned out, you would have to wonder whether Aboriginal people would be better off if we had not had that bipartisan approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For much of the last five years Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal health in particular, which is what this MPI is about, have operated in an environment where people should have been able to get on with the issue. There is no excuse for failure. I would again like to read something from this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>, because to me it sums up everything very well. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All previous efforts to improve the life of Aborigines have had little success. None of the factors mentioned can be remedied in isolation. There is no miracle cure either for the ill health of the children, the alcoholism, the diabetes of the adults or for the depression and despair of the whole community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the level of expenditure by this government will not be cut. I challenge you to detail whether or not you would cut expenditure. You will not quarantine it. In the same way that you threatened other people in disadvantaged positions in this country with cuts to their vital conditions of living, so too would you cut the living conditions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I came into this place to put some issues on the record and to have a serious debate about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. I will proceed with that if the coalition will give me a chance. First of all, I want to make it clear that, as the Prime Minister has said, there are no overnight solutions to the problems confronting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This is a national issue; it is not simply the responsibility of one level of government. As a nation an agreement was reached in 1990 between state, territory and Commonwealth ministers for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and for health on the national Aboriginal health strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that strategy, an additional $232 million was allocated over a five-year period to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. I came into the chamber today to answer the question, `Where has that money gone?' The fact is that $170 million out of the $232 million has gone to basic water, sewerage and infrastructure in those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. For example, Palm Island electrification cost $830,000. Water supply to that one community cost $5.7 million, and that was allocated in a bilateral agreement with the Commonwealth and the Queensland government. I mention these figures to demonstrate the massive cost of addressing the water, sewerage and infrastructure needs of people in those remote communities. To put in sewage disposal systems in the Torres Strait to a relatively tiny group of communities cost $850,000, and the allocation for the upgrade of the water supply cost $5 million. And it goes on. Water, sewerage, housing and basic infrastructure took $171 million from that $232 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the remaining funds, there has been a very significant boost of the order of doubling or thereabouts the resources available for primary health. I am more than happy to table a document which provides detail about the increased services. In New South Wales as a result of that national Aboriginal health strategy there are three new services; there are major upgrades to four new services in the Northern Territory, five new Aboriginal medical services and two new clinics; there are six major upgrades of existing services in Queensland, four new services, one new clinic and three major upgrades. And it goes on around Australia&mdash;one heck of a bang for the Commonwealth buck!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national Aboriginal health strategy, however, has not achieved the outcome that I hope everyone in this parliament would want from future Commonwealth-state policies on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. The reason that we have not seen that change&mdash;and this is what we should be discussing today&mdash;can be found in the evaluation of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health strategy. It highlights a fundamental point. If I do only one thing in this House today, it is to ask the coalition to recognise and embrace this principle: unless we tackle the water, sewerage, housing, roads and basic living conditions in those remote communities, nothing will change. </PARA>

That article was critical of the Department of Housing. The head of the New South Wales housing department, as the voice of the New South Wales government&mdash;it could be the voice of any government because, irrespective of which party is in power, too often the states and territories have not delivered in their responsibilities to Aboriginal people&mdash;had this to say:</PARA>

One of them relates to the question of whether ATSIC or the Department of Human Services and Health should be responsible for the funding of Aboriginal medical services. I want to say this about that debate: firstly, it is a matter which is currently the subject of discussions between ATSIC and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and other ministers. I believe now, as I have always believed, that there will be a negotiated outcome on that issue. Fundamentally important to this question is the wider agenda, and the wider agenda includes the role Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will play in the decision making process. Secondly, what will be done to achieve a coordinated approach and, to be very blunt about it, to ensure that the states and territories are not just passive observers of the national Aboriginal health strategy?

Let us make it very clear. The responsibility for these housing infrastructure services belongs primarily with state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already spoken about primary health care. Let me now talk about hospital care. I have here an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Journal of Public Health</EMPHASIS> Vol. 17, No. 4, December 1993. The article talks about hospitalisation in Queensland. It says that in Queensland there is clear evidence of higher morbidity and mortality rates in Aboriginal communities but that, paradoxically, whereas there are greater hospitalisation rates in discrete Aboriginal communities, there is lower expenditure per person on hospital services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do you figure that out? The most disadvantaged group in the community, the people you have been saying deserve the best treatment, are being underfunded and underresourced in the Queensland hospital system by the Queensland government. I have already established, in the question of primary health care, that the Northern Territory government is underfunding Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the health status. We all accept that it is a tragedy, but we have to do something about it. Those who are failing to do something about it are primarily the state and territory governments. This government has accepted it as a priority. This government made funding available last year. This government has said that it will do more to address the particular issues of Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few weeks we have had the furphy about whether or not ATSIC has been the appropriate body to handle Aboriginal health funds. Let me say this: ATSIC deals with about 50-plus community based health services and its budget is around $50 million. That is all that ATSIC deals with in terms of primary health care. Who wears the rest of the responsibility? Which governments wear the responsibility for providing primary health care? State and territory governments, that's who! Who has failed to provide these services? State and territory governments, that's who! Who has failed to provide the services in terms of housing infrastructure? State and territory governments, that's who!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not try to run away from it. Let us accept who is responsible here, instead of having these glib assertions coming across the table that the people who are responsible rest on the government benches here. We accept the responsibility to address the issue. But it is your mates in the states and territories&mdash;those people you would see as your soul brothers and sisters&mdash;who are failing to provide these services. The Northern Territory provides the most stark example. People trying to do research in relation to the state and territory governments find that the Northern Territory currently has no administrative mechanisms&mdash;note this&mdash;whereby data related to its expenditure on programs for Aboriginal people can be segregated. Understand that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard you argue that it was the Commonwealth's responsibility to gather these statistics. The fact is that the people responsible for delivering the services&mdash;the primary health care deliverers&mdash;are state and territory governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, the opposite is true of the Immigration Review Tribunal. The situation here should be examined because the minister could easily create the same situation in the refugee policy administration area and create even greater uncertainty and further complexities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last six months, the coalition and other groups have expressed concern over appointments that the minister has made to the Immigration Review Tribunal. A considerable body of evidence suggests that these may have been made for political reasons at the expense of more suitably qualified candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no legislative requirements governing the process of appointments, although the committee for the review of the system for review of migration decisions did make some recommendations on the matter in 1992. It suggested that the minister, while free to appoint whoever he or she liked, should widely advertise tribunal vacancies, should appoint a panel to interview candidates, and should report on their suitability based on publicly available criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has fully exploited his discretion in the case of the disputed appointments. He has told the other place, `I fail to see how it is possible for me to politically interfere with my own decisions'. However, we should look at the people that Senator Bolkus chose to appoint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of these, Mr Garth Head and Ms Lyn Kosky, were preselected Labor Party candidates for the Victorian parliament. A reappointed member, Mr Joe Italiano, was another preselected candidate. The principal Victorian tribunal member, Mr Michael Clothier, was replaced by a Ms Michelle Scott, a former Labor Party staffer without a law degree&mdash;something one might consider a necessity for such a senior position&mdash;who was imported from Western Australia to fill this position. The potential to further disrupt the administration of refugee policy in Australia by a similar style of appointments to the Refugee Review Tribunal should be clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the most remarkable case was that of Mr Anthony Labbozzetta. The minister reappointed Mr Labbozzetta despite an adverse report from his own advisory panel; despite evidence that he had sat on only four cases in five years&mdash;none in the past two&mdash;and produced only one decision over the five-year period; and, as he told the Senate inquiry into the Australian Soccer Federation, when he knew Mr Labbozzetta was facing charges over his sporting activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Migration has already looked at these allegations and, while the Labor majority on the committee has cleared the minister, it has suggested changes in the appointments process that amount to a clear criticism of Senator Bolkus. With administration like this, it is no surprise that we are here today. The government is failing to observe the every day proprieties of government and institutional relationships. It is prepared to treat the parliament and the public with contempt. In these circumstances, it is no wonder that we need to constantly correct its slapdash legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), speaking in support of the bill, raised points dealing with retrospectivity and the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I was rather intrigued. I thought that was fair enough; he had comments to make. Not only was there a dissenting report but government members in the Senate also expressed some concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report mentions a number of things which should be recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;things that the member for Berowra omitted to mention. He would not have done that purposely. As usual, he took certain things out of context&mdash;a couple of lines here and there which, he decided, would make his points in the debate&mdash;while not representing other statements made at that hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scrutiny of Bills Committee in the Senate raised objections to the retrospective nature of the bill but, as stated in its report, there is a number of examples of legislation passed by the parliament which has retrospective effect, particularly in the taxation area. It noted that it is generally accepted that retrospective commencement of legislation which is beneficial to the taxpayer does not improperly infringe on personal rights and liberties. In addition, it found that the government has frequently proposed legislation which commences on the day of its public announcement, which may be months before it is passed by parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another section of the report&mdash;section 144, I think&mdash;the government members of the committee expressed their satisfaction that the bill was necessary to shore up the position taken by the parliament in 1992. I think this is the pertinent point of having the bill resubmitted to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and, with all due respect, the opposition are supporting this bill because of what was likely to happen in the High Court if it was not supported.

Whether we are debating for or against something in this House, we should refer to all of the evidence before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) speaking in support of the legislation before the House. There is not a lot more that we need answer. I certainly commend the bill to the House. I reiterate that this is a step the government is taking because, as the opposition is aware, it will cover the original intent of the bill and make sure that the legislation stands up in court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another point I would like to touch on.

We wanted to make sure that that doubt was removed, not only for the benefit of the government but also to make sure that taxpayers were protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me initially focus on the object of the bill. Given the new form of legislative drafting, we have the objects identified in section by section provisions. The aim is to make retrospectively legal the detention of certain Cambodians who arrived in Australia by boat between 1989 and 1992, and since the bill has been debated now twice in the House there is little point in going through the background in detail. Let me say that whatever the objects stated in this bill, it is not cynical; it is demonstrable that the government in introducing the bill does it really for the sole purpose of triggering a section 57 double dissolution.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be seen that that is the case by examining the purpose of the bill and how it is likely to be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitutional validity of the damages cap provision has been called into question, as is well known, and in March 1994 the High Court delivered a judgment in which it decided that extinguishing a cause of action for damages against the Commonwealth in tort amounts to an acquisition for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution. That empowers the Commonwealth to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth that have the effect of acquiring property from any state or person for any purpose in respect of which the Commonwealth parliament has the power to make laws, on condition that such acquisition is made on `just terms'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main basis for the current constitutional challenge to the damages cap provision is that, as a reduction of the claim for damages, it is an acquisition of property without just terms and thus is contrary to section 51(xxxi). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the High Court decision in March last year, the Solicitor-General has given a written opinion that the High Court is likely to declare the damages cap provision invalid. He has also given advice that an amendment to the Migration Act that retrospectively made the unlawful detention lawful may be held by the High Court to be valid. That is what this bill seeks to do. I will comment on the Solicitor-General's advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of the bill in giving authorities the power of detention in cases where the boat on which a person arrives has been destroyed or will not otherwise leave Australia must be called into question. The provision applies solely to cases of arrival and detention that occurred between 1 November 1989 and the 1992 repeal of the section of the act under which those people had unlawfully been held. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people would realise the tortured history of this particular piece of legislation. It was passed by the House of Representatives by the government using its numbers, it was rejected by the Senate on 9 November 1994, and it has now been introduced into this place for a second time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be aware that we opposed the bill last time because we had a number of concerns about it. On our side of the House we have major problems with the issue of retrospectivity. We also believe that the legislation breached certain basic principles of law, that it was designed to make lawful what is now unlawful, that it had been introduced in an attempt to cover past policy and administrative failures by the Labor government, and further that it could be subjected to High Court challenge if enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been substantial debate in the Australian community over this particular piece of legislation and, as has been mentioned by prior speakers, the coalition has responded to the feeling in the Australian community that something has to be done, particularly given the arrival of large additional numbers of boat people. We now find ourselves in the position in this place of not opposing the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that more than 800 illegal immigrants from southern China have arrived on our shores since November 1994 when the other place defeated the bill we are now discussing. The arrival of such a large number of boat people has hardened community attitudes and as we have been approached by people in the community the coalition is reflecting community concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also substantial worries that additional boats could be on the way. I must say that criticism could be extended in the direction of the government because, by its dilatory approach to migration, and particularly refugees, Australia is perceived as being a soft target. I think it is important that we send a message to people throughout the world that our migration system should indeed have integrity and that is one of the reasons why we, as a coalition, are not opposing what the government is seeking to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, 800 people have arrived following the defeat of the bill in the Senate last year. But since 1989 over 1,700 people without visas have arrived from Cambodia, Vietnam and China. Nine hundred of these arrived in 1994. Of these people, 400 have won residency here and they remain here in this nation. About 500 have left, and 800 are currently in detention. I understand that the Port Hedland facility is now at full capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to also be noted that in the last financial year the cost to the taxpayer of processing applications from boat people and keeping them in detention, security, health and administration, according to newspaper reports, amounted to over $65 million. I realise that as a nation we have some obligations in the area of human rights, but when we look at the desperate plight that so many Australians find themselves in following the recession `we had to have', a lot of people understandably question the expenditure of $65 million in one year alone on maintaining and administering this area of migration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that $65 million does not include legal fees or the cost of their return for those people who were in fact deported. Port Hedland costs $55 per inmate per day and Villawood costs $150 per inmate per day. As we can see, as the days go by, the dollars mount up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be realised that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that there are more than 40 million people in vulnerable situations throughout the world, 19 million of whom could be seen as refugees. While Australia has done more than its fair share in the area of refugees, it is fairly clear, given the situation throughout the world, that we simply cannot take everyone. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It provides, in general terms, that it is the intention of the parliament that, despite the 1992 repeal of section 88 of the Migration Act, the amendments made by this act are to have effect only for a period from 1 November 1989 until the repeal of section 88 in 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plainly, this is a most unusual provision and it is intended to meet a most unusual situation. But one has to call in question the genuine intention of the government with respect to that provision. What it is seeking to do is to amend the law retrospectively to cater for particular people and deprive them of particular rights. The remedy that the government proposes is set out in clause 9. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the bill is to remedy a situation. It seeks to do that by, in effect, varying the approach, so that what is not done is the removal of rights but, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) put it in the second reading speech, an insertion of a curative clause. The curative clause was inserted on the advice of the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General's advice was based on a series of decisions in the High Court. Those decisions reflect a view, identified in American law, that, where the law has been understood to be, effectively, black, but is, in operation, white, it is merely curative to remedy the situation to what was previously understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority that the High Court referred to, and the principal authority relied upon by the Solicitor-General in his advice, is a decision which prevented windfall benefits and windfall profits being acquired. It was not a situation in which there were rights already acquired being taken away; it was a situation where there was something that was understood to provide a limited benefit that was discovered at a later time to provide a much greater benefit than was intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a situation where, plainly, there is a right to damages arising out of a defect in the administration of the legislation by the minister. What is sought to be done is to take away something that was previously acquired. It is not to deprive them of a benefit; it is really to impose a penalty. That is where I suspect the Solicitor-General's advice is going to fall down and that is where I suspect the High Court is going to find this bill invalid, as well as the amendment introducing section 54RA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That really raises the broad question: what is the government introducing this bill for? It is seeking to completely remove a claim to damages. It has been held invalid to limit damages to an acquisition of property other than on just terms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), is querying the case I am putting. The case I am putting is that the government in introducing the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is really anticipating that it will be held invalid in the High Court. If that is correct, one wonders what on earth the real reason is for introducing it. Since it was rejected by the Senate more than three months ago, has now been reintroduced and is likely to be passed after the three-month period specified in section 57, it raises the question of the real intentions of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is very short, but there is also a most unusual provision for a short bill, a provision that raises directly the possibility that provisions of the bill are constitutionally invalid. It is not a common provision in a bill; it is more likely to be found in an acts interpretation bill or a bill dealing with legislation that is widely based. In this case, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) is contemplating that some provision of section 9 is going to be interpreted as having a valid operation and an invalid operation and is seeking to have the invalid operation inoperative and the valid operation as the one that takes effect. If that does not raise the issue of whether the legislation is constitutionally valid, I do not know what does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises a question which I seek to highlight of the intention of the government in introducing the legislation. The government is relying on two decisions of the High Court which really are quite distinguishable from the situation in contemplation here. If the best advice the government can get is the advice from the Solicitor-General relying on those two distinguishable cases, there is no case for the validity of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that this bill, in the end, will do nothing to solve the problem faced by the government. In light of that, the position of the opposition in not opposing it is simply a position of saying, `There is nothing to be gained by opposing a bill that will be impotent and ineffective.' In saying that, I seek to highlight that the section 57 trigger is very much to the fore and it may take some time before the constitutional validity of the bill is determined if it follows the ordinary course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises the question of whether there is a valid section 57 trigger if the bill is unconstitutional.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in his speech that the bill will provide the legislative authority to enforce and reflect in our law the terms of the agreement with the government of New Zealand. I might say that the New Zealand government is to be commended for pursuing this matter and reaching agreement, because this government not long ago reneged&mdash;ratted, in fact&mdash;on an agreement with the government of New Zealand in connection with the provision of domestic air services in Australia. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that agreement involved the access of Air New Zealand into the Australian domestic airline market. Hence the amendment which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition, which I am sure the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) will remember to second at the conclusion of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill was introduced into the House on 8 February 1995. It gives the force of law in Australia to a comprehensive double tax agreement which was signed with New Zealand on 27 January 1995. As the title of the bill suggests, there should be more than one agreement contained within the bill because it has `(International Agreements)' in the title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Unfortunately, the agreements that were originally intended to be negotiated with both Fiji and the Czech republic are not yet completed. We have been informed that the agreement with the Czech republic is soon to be signed and the relevant legislation should be introduced during the budget sittings. I understand the agreement with Fiji will take a lot longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The finalisation of double tax agreements between Australia and our trading partners is a measure that Australian businesses with global plans urgently require. This double tax agreement is an especially important development in terms of closer economic relations&mdash;CER&mdash;between Australia and New Zealand. The CER process is vital to the economic development of both countries. The coalition makes no apology for its support of the CER process and its likely eventual outcome of delivering a single trans-Tasman market. This taxation agreement is only one aspect of the closer economic relations between the trans-Tasman neighbours, and I will come back to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The provisions of the agreement closely correspond with those in Australia's other modern double tax agreements. The particular agreement with New Zealand replaces the existing treaty concluded in 1992 and reflects major tax reforms in both countries since then. It also ensures that all forms of income flowing between the two countries are taxed only once, with one or two exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The agreement provides for cooperation between the respective authorities to prevent tax evasion and clarifies trans-Tasman taxation issues. Incidentally, the agreement only covers federal taxes. It applies to Australian income tax, resource rent tax and fringe benefits tax and New Zealand's income tax and fringe benefits tax. It will apply to persons, including companies, resident of one or both countries and deriving trans-Tasman income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill amends the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953. Previous double tax agreements with New Zealand made in 1960 and in 1972 will continue to have the force of law for the years of income applicable at the relevant times under those agreements. In 1993 the Minister for Trade announced that the agreement would be renegotiated in February 1994. That announcement was preceded by statements in October 1991 by the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand that specific taxation arrangements which may have impeded bilateral trade and investment would be on the agenda for the 1992 review of closer economic relations. Both countries are attempting to pass the treaty legislation&mdash;for our part, that is this bill&mdash;by 1 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The agreement deals with several tax issues such as income from real property, taxation of other income, entertainers and trans-Tasman rugby league players, business profits, withholding tax and capital gains tax. The agreement contains a new article to deal with income from real property. It will be taxed in the country of source; that is, in the country where the property is located. Income from real property extends to the direct use, leasing of any land or interest in land; and royalties and other payments for, or exploitation of, mines, quarries or other natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This rule applies if the property is owned by an enterprise or an independent professional person resident in the country in which the property is located irrespective of whether the income is attributable to a permanent establishment of the enterprise or fixed base of the person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 22 of the agreement is a `sweeper' article which sets out the rules for allocating taxing rights to all other forms of income not dealt with in preceding articles of the agreement. Generally, other income is to be taxed only in the country of residence unless it is derived from sources in the other country. In that case the other country may also impose tax but the country of residence must provide double tax relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article extends to income from real property if the income is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base in a country other than where the property is located. The agreement provides that visiting entertainers may be taxed in the country in which the activities are exercised irrespective of the duration of the visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, participants&mdash;and the Auckland Warriors will be pleased to know about this&mdash;in trans-Tasman rugby league competitions will be taxed in their country of residence unless they are present in the other country for a period greater than six months for the purpose of deriving the income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and New Zealand have similar fringe benefits regimes which commenced after the signing of the 1972 agreement. The new agreement includes articles to prevent the possible double taxation of trans-Tasman fringe benefits. The agreement gives a sole taxing right to the country which has the sole or primary right to tax the remuneration for the employment that gives rise to the fringe benefit, thereby ensuring that an employer is only subject to FBT in one country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current agreement contains the force of attraction principle under which business profits of an enterprise are taxed in the country of source regardless of whether they are connected with the permanent business establishment. The new agreement removes that principle and provides that business profits, including fees for consultancy services derived by an enterprise in one country, are subject to tax levied by the source country only to the extent that the profit is attributable to a permanent establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will reduce its rate of withholding tax on unfranked dividends paid by Australian resident companies to New Zealand residents from 30 per cent of the gross amount of dividends to 15 per cent. Franked dividends paid by Australian resident companies to New Zealand residents will continue to be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trans-Tasman insurance business dividend withholding tax is limited to five per cent to reflect the five per cent branch profits tax equivalent that New Zealand imposes. The agreement puts a limit on source country taxation of interest of 10 per cent in all circumstances. This rate is also extended to interest paid to associates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current agreement, the existing agreement, the 10 per cent maximum does not apply. So this is an improvement on the existing situation where interest payments from New Zealand to Australia are subject to tax of up to 38 per cent, whereas from Australia to New Zealand the rate is 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement also puts a limit on source country taxation of royalties of 10 per cent of the gross amount of royalties paid to owners in the other country. Under the present agreement the rate is 15 per cent. However, this limitation does not apply to royalties for natural resources which remain taxable by the country of source without any limit on the rate of tax that can be imposed. In addition, the definition of royalties is changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Management services have been dropped from the definition and the scope of the definition has been extended to cover rights to receive satellite, cable and optic fibre transactions. As is customary, the limits I have mentioned do not apply to dividends, interest or royalties that are effectively connected with a permanent establishment of the enterprise, or fixed based that a resident of one country has in the other country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to capital gains tax, the agreement generally allows each country to tax, according to its own domestic laws, gains of a capital nature by its own residents, but with special rules for real property, assets used by permanent business establishments, ships and aircraft. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of this bill, we are assured, will be negligible. The coalition does not oppose this bill, but there are some matters about which we, and others, do have concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The renegotiation of the double tax agreement with New Zealand is a welcome development, which has been awaited for several years. It may lead to more Australian investment in New Zealand, as it clarifies anomalies arising under the existing treaty. Tony Featherstone, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> earlier this year, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax experts believe the trans-Tasman agreement . . . will lead to more Australian investment in New Zealand, as it clarifies many anomalies caused by the previous treaty, in place since 1972.</PARA>
<PARA>The New Zealand Minister for Finance, Mr Birch, and the Minister for Revenue, Mr Creech, said in a joint statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government had been aware of a number of shortcomings in the existing treaty . . . the new treaty will reduce compliance costs, and help stimulate trans-Tasman investment.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst the agreement does contain several changes, which are positive in nature, it has still not resolved the problem of mutual recognition of dividend imputation rebates. Ian Dinnison, of Arthur Andersen, is quoted by Tony Featherstone as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inability of Australian companies to use New Zealand tax credits, and the New Zealand withholding tax on dividends paid back to Australia, are major frustrations of Australian groups with trans-Tasman operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Geoff Lehmann was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 3 February as saying that it was ironic that Australia and New Zealand could not get mutual recognition of each other's tax credits, when Ireland and Finland had agreed on theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These last two nations have very different political systems, languages and cultures, yet Australia and New Zealand with the same language, Westminster-style democracies, and many other similarities, seem unable to reach agreement on this matter. Mr Lehmann is critical of the government's handling of this matter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It makes a joke of our government's preaching internationalisation to business, if it can't negotiate completely open commercial relations with its nearest neighbour.</PARA>
<PARA>To this he added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's push into Asia would be much better served if the closer economic relations with New Zealand could fully happen, and both countries could benefit from being part of a larger single economy, thus allowing greater specialisation and encouraging greater efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>This begs the obvious question: did the Australian government attempt to include New Zealand tax credits and withholding tax on dividends in the agreement process? We simply do not know. The fact is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself ruled out the inclusion of dividend imputation credits in the negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 May 1993, whilst in New Zealand, the Prime Minister made it clear that the Australian government could not countenance their inclusion because he believed, and probably still does, it would result in too large a loss of revenue. Mr Mike Jasper in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dominion</EMPHASIS> newspaper&mdash;published in New Zealand obviously&mdash;in its 25 May 1993 edition, conveyed the opinion of New Zealand tax experts when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's stand is contrary to the spirit of the closer economic relations agreement, and a blow to efforts to encourage greater trans-Tasman investment.</PARA>
<PARA>Mike Jasper makes it clear our Prime Minister's objections were based on a predicted fall in revenue which will not be made up by the anticipated increase in trans-Tasman business activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current provisions are opposed by the business community on both sides of the Tasman. The business community has been lobbying heavily for the Australian government to change its position. At present New Zealanders owning shares in Australia do not receive a tax credit for tax paid on dividends there, and vice versa. The result is, of course, that they pay tax twice. Mr John Shewin of Coopers and Lybrand has stated:</PARA>

<PARA>The New Zealand government recognises that both treasuries will lose revenue if agreement is reached, but, to his credit, Prime Minister Bolger is adamant an agreement should be reached. On 25 May, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dominion</EMPHASIS>, Mr Bolger is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice I've had, and the advice of my ministers working close to it, is that it can be done, but it won't be easy.</PARA>

<PARA>The New Zealand government is made of the right stuff. It can afford to come to an agreement for the good of trans-Tasman commerce. It has not squandered its budgetary position as Australia under Labor has vandalised ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the facts. For 1994-95 Australia is facing a revised budget deficit of $12.3 billion, which is up from the initial forecast of $11.7 billion. New Zealand, on the other hand, with only 3 1/2 million people, will achieve a budget surplus this year of $NZ2.3 billion. New Zealand is also riding something approaching an economic boom, whilst Australia is perilously close to once again going down the economic slippery slope. New Zealand, through disciplined fiscal policy, is better able to meet the coming international economic challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, Labor cannot come to terms with the fiscal realities it has created for itself, and the immediate, and potentially long-term, prognosis is that Australia's economic interests will continue to be sacrificed. The government is currently examining other matters besides tax matters which will facilitate an increase in the level of trans-Tasman trade. Issues such as mutual recognition of product standards and occupational qualifications are being examined by both the Australian and New Zealand governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt that reducing the impediments to freeing up trade across the Tasman, or between any two countries, is a difficult task and, in many instances, must be progressed gradually. Hopefully, in the near future the issue of tax credits will be resolved, as the pace of economic integration across the Tasman continues to progress. From the past performance of Labor, and considering the disastrous fiscal position we find ourselves in under Labor, it would be a wise man who predicted that the present government is going to tackle the harder CER issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another note, this agreement does not affect the imposition of New Zealand withholding tax at 15 per cent on franked dividends. This is an anomaly which should be eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement has been criticised for favouring New Zealand companies with Australian subsidiaries and penalising Australian companies with New Zealand subsidiaries. Where a New Zealand subsidiary pays a dividend to an Australian parent company, the New Zealand government receives 43 per cent, the Australian shareholder 29.4 per cent and the Australian government 27.6 per cent. However, where a New Zealand parent company receives fully franked dividends from an Australian subsidiary, it will not have its income reduced by Australian withholding tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other criticisms of the agreement are that the taxation of superannuation funds remains different and that the agreement fails to address the different approaches that the countries adopt to payments for software. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International money flows are in the news these days. The Institute of Chartered Accountants is to be commended for having the foresight to recognise there is a serious problem with money laundering around the world these days. This is particularly the case as international money markets continue to open up because of legislation such as that now before the House and due to other developments. In some European countries, laws exist by which accountants must report suspicious money flows which may be part of a money laundering operation. We do not have such laws in Australia, and we should not need them so long as accountants recognise they have an obligation to report to the proper authorities any suspected money laundering activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, a potential clash here between client confidentiality and the public good. The reason I mention it is that the institute has come down firmly in favour of the public good. Mr Jeff Lucy, president of the institute, said in a media release only last week:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These guidelines state emphatically that an accountant's duty of confidentiality is overridden by the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines state that an accountant should disclose activity which he or she suspects on reasonable grounds to be money laundering, to the proper authorities, and provides a mechanism to assist members in this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This appears to be a most proper guide by which accountants should work, not only to protect the community but also to protect themselves from possible criminal prosecution. The guidelines are even more commendable because they have the input of several law enforcement bodies and other government agencies. We in the coalition applaud the accountancy profession for that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the bill before us ensures income flows between Australia and New Zealand are taxed only once, generally speaking; provides for cooperation between both governments to prevent tax evasion; and clarifies which country has the tax rights over categories of trans-Tasman income flows. As previously mentioned, the coalition does have concerns about some exclusions from the agreement and hence from this bill. Hopefully, for the good of CER, the government will get serious and try to resolve the outstanding matters I have touched upon in these remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I trust that my enthusiasm can match that of the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1995 enshrines in law the new double taxation agreement between Australia and New Zealand which was signed by the parties in January of this year, effectively updating the 1972 agreement on the same matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to place into law a number of matters flowing from that agreement, effectively updating and reforming the substance of the agreement, particularly relating to taxation of income from property; taxation of fringe benefits; the reduction of the withholding tax on royalties from 15 per cent to 10 per cent; change with respect to the taxation of business profits of branches of an Australian company operating in New Zealand, now being taxed separately; and various other matters of detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, as I indicated, this is an update of a longstanding agreement to take into account various changes in the taxation arrangements that evolve from time to time in both countries. It removes a number of uncertainties and anomalies which have impeded Australian companies doing business in New Zealand. As the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has indicated, the close connection with the closer economic relations agreement&mdash;the CER agreement&mdash;is acknowledged by the government. Clearly, that is a matter of major substance in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation generally ensures that income earned in each country is taxed only once. It helps to assist in a number of matters that are under active consideration. One example that was cited by the honourable member for Curtin was the development of the new trans-Tasman rugby league competition, which will have the Auckland Warriors playing in Australia. As a result of this legislation, the players will be taxed only once on their winnings, on the basis of their country of residence. That is one fairly straightforward illustration. Sadly, we cannot have an AFL equivalent because the people of New Zealand have not really taken to that code, but we can live in hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is also clearly part of the gradual process of the Australian and New Zealand economies, if not integrating, at least getting more closely linked. It contains a number of detailed provisions to ensure that the mechanisms for allocating tax liability within the economic activity that occurs across the Tasman are as fair and open as possible. For example, there is a provision for a `tie breaker rule' which is a mechanism to determine whether a person is actually resident in Australia or New Zealand legally and, therefore, which particular tax regime that person will be subject to. There are a variety of provisions in the legislation with respect to detailed circumstances&mdash;for example, the circumstance of entertainers' incomes, directors' fees, old age pensions, maintenance flowing from family law settlements or judgments and various other matters&mdash;but I will not go into those in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to respond to the points raised by the honourable member for Curtin, if not in direct opposition to but as a complaint of the bill, because I think they are a fraction uncharitable and fail to recognise the significant advance that has occurred as a result of this legislation. Those points also fail to take into account some perfectly legitimate reasons why the things that he and some people in the business community seek have not come about on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His complaint was the failure of the agreement to provide a zero rate for dividend withholding tax. The basic reason for this is that the New Zealand tax system is still substantially different from that of Australia. I note that the honourable member for Curtin referred to an agreement between Ireland and Finland with respect to the mutual recognition of taxation and economic activity between those two countries. I am not aware of the precise detail of the agreement and express some surprise that they could manage to come to such an agreement, given that they are quite different countries with different cultures and languages, although perhaps not quite as different as he might think. In terms of culture, origin and geography, Australia and New Zealand are probably about as close as any two countries in the world and as yet are unable to come to such an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin, in his exposition, missed one point: the question of taxation systems. It is fairly safe to assume that one of the reasons such an agreement was able to be reached between Ireland and Finland was that they had compatible taxation arrangements which meant that the two could sit together without the risk of avoidance mechanisms emerging as a result of the agreement. That, indeed, is the primary reason we have not been able to enter into the arrangements sought by the honourable member for Curtin at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian taxation system is substantially different from the New Zealand taxation system in a number of pertinent respects, the critical difference being that New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax. There are a number of other areas, such as a much greater reliance on indirect taxation in New Zealand. New Zealand also imposes withholding tax even though company profits have been fully taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the request from the New Zealand government that dividend imputation credits be fully recognised, thereby effectively leading to a zero rating: the Australian government's concern, which led it to decline that request, is the risk of two consequences flowing from it. One is the development of a trans-Tasman avoidance industry based on the perceived need of Australian companies to avoid capital gains tax. That would run the risk of our heading back into the sort of situation we had in the 1970s and early 1980s with income being effectively changed artificially into capital gains and ultimately, in this case, being channelled in some form or other through a New Zealand corporate arrangement in order to avoid tax. That is obviously a legitimate concern on the part of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern was the risk that, as a result or related to it, we would see a net shift in investment away from Australia into New Zealand, which is obviously something that none of us would desire, certainly on the basis of taxation arrangements. Partly as a result of that&mdash;it is probably arguable as to what extent that concern was involved&mdash;the New Zealand government declined to agree to change its dividend withholding tax arrangements. For the information of the honourable member for Curtin, Australia pressed for a zero rate for dividend withholding tax, and the New Zealand government declined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand was not prepared to consider lowering its dividend withholding tax without mutual recognition of dividend imputation credits. This is ironic when you consider the comments made by the honourable member for Curtin that, according to New Zealand, the primary reason was that dividend withholding tax is a significant revenue base for the government and also part of its international anti-tax avoidance regime. The key thing that he is accusing the government of doing in this case is in fact the primary reason why the New Zealand government adopted the position that he does not like. Its reason for taking its position on one half of this issue&mdash;namely, concern about international tax avoidance&mdash;is the same as the Australian government's reason for taking its position with respect to the recognition of imputation credits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, I do not think we have any villain in this issue. We have a simple situation where the two tax regimes in the two countries are not sufficiently compatible at this stage to allow the agreement to go as far as the honourable member for Curtin has sought without actually creating significant problems, such as greater tax avoidance. That does not mean that these things cannot occur in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth while to point out to the opposition that the government, in a sense, faced a choice here. It could have chosen to put the other issues that are in this legislation on the backburner and said, `We'll keep negotiating with the New Zealand government,' but it has decided to say, `We will make the gains, the update and the improvement that go with respect to the various matters relating to property income, FBT and the like in this legislation, accepting that we are unable to reach agreement on the issues that the honourable member for Curtin has raised.' That does not mean that those issues are going to go off into the never-never and never be addressed again. Clearly, they will remain the subject of potential discussion between Australia and New Zealand in the future. Obviously, future changes in the taxation regimes of either country could well lead to a different situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably also worth referring to the supplementary comments made by the honourable member for Curtin because they were yet another amusing example of the hypocritical approach the opposition has to fiscal matters. Yet again we have the opposition, albeit in a fairly minor guise in this case, indicating that it supports forgoing revenue. Another example is when the opposition says the Commonwealth in effect should spend taxpayers' money or forgo tax revenue in a particular area. I suppose it is equivalent in a much lesser way to some of the promises that the honourable member for Berowra, who is sitting on the opposition front bench, has hinted at in press releases recently, which the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has given a thorough examination of in question time in recent months in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again we have the opposition parading the alleged fiscal profligacy of the government. It tells us, `Our budget deficit is enormous and New Zealand is a model of fiscal rectitude.' But at the same time it says, `We should allow more revenue to leach out of the system by going further in this particular legislation.' That is directly contradictory. The honourable member for Curtin, in a few fairly typical comments, mentioned how terrible the deficit was. Yet, at the same time, he tells us that we should allow more revenue to leach out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the opposition's response to the proposed cuts. The finance department put out a document&mdash;as is its job&mdash;along with other departments about proposals to the budget detailing the sorts of things that could be done if cuts needed to be made to expenditure&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YU5">Mr TANNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is getting more and more entertaining by the minute! In response to the indication of the honourable member for Curtin on the budget deficit and this particular legislation, we have a situation where the opposition in here and in the general public arena is saying, `We should be cutting tax but'&mdash;shock, horror&mdash;`we should not be cutting government expenditure.' And in spite of both those things we should have a lower budget deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again today the opposition has come in here and said, `The business community doesn't like this situation; therefore you should legislate and reach an agreement with the New Zealand government which will lead to less revenue for the federal government of Australia.' That is exactly the same situation in microcosm that is occurring in the broad public debate across Australia. That is a total contradiction in the opposition's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is fiscal lunacy in the opposition's position. At no stage do we hear from those opposite where their cuts of expenditure would be. They are happy to go out and frighten everybody who receives any form of welfare payment from the government, suggesting that the government will do something to them. They did that very well in 1993. They frightened people so well with their policy that they lost an election as a result. Fortunately for the people of Australia, for a change they were honest about their policies. Now they are slipping back into the old Andrew Peacock populist model: `Let's not tell them anything. Let's not be honest about what we want to do.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback was what the Liberal Party believed in. It was a document that said, `We are so absolutely confident that we are going to win. We have this election wrapped up completely. We know that we are going to win, and therefore we can put forward the platform we believe in.' They got a pasting as a result of that. Now they are saying, `No, in terms of industrial relations, we don't believe in the big bang any more or in frightening anybody. We'll probably retain Medicare. We don't really want big government expenditure cuts.' When the shadow minister for finance is challenged about his comments about Business Council of Australia statements with respect to cuts, he backs away from them&mdash;`No, I didn't really endorse them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So yet again in this debate the opposition has said something that is inherently contradictory to its basic broad position in the public arena: `Let's have more dollars floating out of the Commonwealth exchequer. Let's say, "No problems. Here is some more corporate welfare&mdash;a small but nonetheless significant amount"'. Again, a little illustration of the hypocrisy of the opposition on fiscal matters. I will conclude by returning to the essence of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker. Perhaps the honourable member for Berowra might chat with his colleague in the future and suggest that he not do so. The legislation, whatever the criticisms of the opposition, is nonetheless a significant step forward for the process of greater economic integration between Australia and New Zealand&mdash;something that is both inevitable and worth while. There is common agreement on both sides of the House on that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not reach a level of complete integration, the reason being that both countries still retain control over their respective taxation systems. For a whole variety of reasons, which I think we are entitled to assume are legitimate, there are differences between the taxation systems of the two countries. There are different economic and political imperatives. Therefore, the objectives sought by certain elements in the business community and by the honourable member for Curtin have not been achievable in this context. As I said earlier, I do not believe there are any villains in that regard. It is simply a reflection of the different economic and political imperatives that are driving both the interests of Australia, with its taxation system as it currently operates, and the interests of New Zealand. With respect to the recognition of dividends and the related question of withholding tax on dividends, at this point they have proved to be hurdles which we are unable to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that those issues will not be addressed in the future. It does not mean that this bill is worthless, and I accept that the opposition is not saying that. We need to acknowledge that this is a significant step forward. It has been 23 years since the previous agreement was put in place. An awful lot has happened in the taxation structure of both countries since then. This bill updates the arrangements applying to taxation across the countries. The degree of trans-Tasman economic activity has increased substantially in that time and will undoubtedly increase substantially in the future as the two economies&mdash;and indeed those two economies as part of the broader region&mdash;internationalise more rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although I do not dispute the basic proposition of the honourable member for Curtin that a greater level of integration with respect to taxation arrangements is desirable, I dispute his conclusion that there is some blame on the part of the Australian government for the fact that, at this point, that situation has not been achieved. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

It has a $26 billion deficit, yet he claims that it has the greatest system of policies to control and manage the Australian economy devised by any government. He also claimed that, no matter how deficient the legislation, it is still all right because it has been devised by the Australian Labor Party. Nothing could be further from the truth.

The hypocrite of the Australian parliament must be the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are debating the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1995. It is an interesting piece of legislation. It does not achieve all the objectives that the coalition would like it to achieve. That is the reason we have moved a second reading amendment which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is basically saying that we support so much of this legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the House condemns the Government for recently signing a double taxation agreement with New Zealand without achieving an entirely neutral position on withholding tax to the detriment of certain Australian interests".</PARA>
<PARA>That is a patriotic statement on behalf of Australian companies. It has nothing to do with what the previous speaker, the spokesman for the government on this issue, has claimed as walking away from our responsibilities. What we are doing is sticking up for what we think is a rough deal that some Australian firms, compared with New Zealand firms, have got out of this agreement. It is as simple as that. We reckon the government could have done better if it had applied itself differently or gone about the process differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of options the government could have adopted in this legislation. It could have decided that it would in some way quarantine those areas on which it had reached agreement with the New Zealand government and said that it would accept what it had got for the time being and would pursue over a period&mdash;being prepared to take a little time and to adopt a reasonable and conciliatory attitude, but not racing through the processes&mdash;the withholding tax area where there was a failure to reach the best agreement in Australian eyes, and probably in the long run the best agreement for both countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What all members of this parliament want ultimately to see, I guess, is a harmony between the systems to the greatest degree possible. We feel that with a bit more time, a bit more patience and a bit more effort, we might have achieved a better agreement. That is unknown. But the government was not prepared to apply itself to the process. Ministerial involvement and discussions of that sort, apart from the good work done by officials, would have been beneficial to both nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why not quarantine the good work that was achieved under this agreement by coming to a harmonious and quality decision with regard to income from real property, the taxation of other income, which is the sweep-up article setting out the rules for allocating taxing rights to all other forms of income not dealt with in the preceding articles of the agreement, and generally other income to be taxed only in the country of residence unless it is derived from sources in the other country. Other issues covered in the agreement relate to visiting entertainers, participants in trans-Tasman rugby league competitions, trans-Tasman fringe benefits tax&mdash;that is something I would like to make some comment on briefly&mdash;and also business profits. Finally, withholding tax and dividends were matters that could not be agreed on between the New Zealand and Australian governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had time to consider this legislation. I thank the minister for making available officials to the coalition's treasury committee to go through the details. They have been impeccable in giving us the facts. The facts are of achievement to a fair degree for the government in the renegotiation of the tax agreement with New Zealand, except in the one area of dividend withholding tax. Australian firms are somewhat disadvantaged by this process. The coalition intends to continue to work to improve tax agreements with New Zealand. Unlike the previous speaker, and I suspect successive government speakers, we are signalling to the New Zealand government that we are not concluded with this process. We want to go on and would welcome a closer relationship with the New Zealand government and a closer and more harmonious relationship in the administration of taxation law and company law in general. So this is the start of a process that the coalition, unlike the government, wants to undertake and pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use this opportunity to draw to the attention of the House some of the advances that the New Zealanders have made in the management of their economy. Compared with Australia, one must be impressed by the processes that the New Zealand people have adopted to rectify a disastrous economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons it was said that we could not gain complete understanding with the New Zealand government and the New Zealand people over the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill and the uniformity of taxation treatment between the two countries was that New Zealand has a goods and services tax and Australia has a capital gains tax and that therefore it is a difficult process to reconcile taxation systems to be completely fair and balanced when treating dividends, withholding tax and imputation credits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making a comparison between the two countries and between their taxation regimes and saying that the difference is too great, one has to ask: what is the ultimate impact of those two different tax regimes on both countries? Over the last six or seven years since 1987-88, gross domestic product in New Zealand has moved ahead steadily and has kept pace with the growth in gross domestic product in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the House to figures produced by the Economist Intelligence Unit Country Reports which indicate a general growth in gross domestic product in both countries at about the same pace. It is interesting to note that over the last couple of years Australia has increased its gross national product per head by substantially more than has New Zealand, but that is a blip and everybody understands that we are now going back to some economic problems: things are slowing down around the country, interest rates are climbing, the deficit is a problem and the government has to draw a budget that skates the fine line between resolving the huge deficit of $26 billion and balancing the books. What will it do? Will it increase income tax and make cuts? That is probably what it will do. It will do a bit of this and a bit of that&mdash;a bit of deficit reduction by cutting its own expenditure and a bit by increasing revenue in the form of taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that the world market has to understand what the government is doing and accept it. Otherwise, interest rates will continue to rise. That is the risk that the government runs and that is the risk and the danger confronting the Prime Minister. The difference between Australia and New Zealand in gross national product over the last 12 months is one that I would not take much account of because I think it is a one-off yearly phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the inflation rates in the two countries over the last eight years have been fairly equal: in New Zealand, 5.9 per cent and in Australia, 4.6 per cent. However, over the last five years, New Zealand has had a steadily declining inflation rate down to about 1.4 per cent or 1.8 per cent whereas Australia's has been running at around one per cent but is now rising again up to about two per cent. So there is a bit of movement and continuing pressure for increased inflation and increased costs in Australia, which is a matter of deep concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, overall, if one covers a period of years, one sees that the New Zealand administration has been able to carefully manage inflation and has not had the scorched earth policies that the Australian government has applied here through its high interest rates. So the New Zealand process of managing inflation has been much better. The New Zealand management of unemployment over a period also looks to have been much better than that of Australia. Generally, the percentage of people unemployed in that country has been far lower than here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of the New Zealand dollar on foreign currency markets has strengthened by about 18 per cent since 1989 compared with the value of the Australian currency. So the international money markets are saying that New Zealand is managing better as a nation than is Australia. It is as simple as that: New Zealand is doing better than we are and the world acknowledges that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the balance of payments, New Zealand is in a much better position than Australia&mdash;a $26 billion deficit compared with a $2 billion deficit. So the balance of payments is proportionally better. Going back over a period of years, it has consistently been getting better, although, tragically, both nations are in the red. The balance of trade in New Zealand is brilliant. It is its real strength. New Zealand is trading its way out of its problems whereas Australia is not. The balance of trade is in New Zealand's favour by about $1,600 million a year, whereas Australia's balance of trade is a paltry $500-odd million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taken all round, a summary of the two nations would indicate that New Zealand is performing much better than Australia. The Australian government, in coming to this taxation agreement, has not been able to satisfy the coalition that it has applied itself sufficiently strongly to the imperatives that were before it and that the Australian government does not understand some of the advances that the New Zealand people have made over the last five or six years. That is not a matter that necessarily reflects in a taxation agreement, but it does indicate that there is a difference in attitude between the two nations and that the Australian people and the Australian government are saying, `We're managing near enough and near enough is good enough.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealanders have driven a hard bargain and they have refused to give on one important area, to Australia's detriment. I believe we should have continued the negotiations, kept working forward, so that we have ultimate harmonisation of our systems to the greatest degree possible. If that meant that the areas of withholding tax and imputation credits had to be left to one side for the time being while negotiations continued and later on this year we had further legislation adding to the agreement, I would not see any problem with that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have made our point in this area clear. I notice that my colleague the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) is in the chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to follow the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), in his comments on this Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1995, which I think is of some significance to Australia and has potential implications for our country and, indeed, our relationship with many other countries around the world. The Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill gives the force of law in Australia to a new double tax agreement signed with New Zealand on 27 January 1995. The new agreement replaces an existing treaty concluded in 1972, which itself followed an agreement in 1960. This bill has become necessary because of the major tax changes in both countries since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Double tax agreements are designed to ensure that income flowing between one country and another is taxed only once. Agreements also provide for cooperation between tax authorities to prevent tax evasion. Australia has double tax agreements with 35 countries in Asia, Europe, Scandinavia and America. As New Zealand is our closest neighbour and the country with which we have the closest trading, investment and social links, it is essential that our countries have an effective modern double tax agreement. It is clearly a vital element of closer economic relations that our tax systems be harmonised also as strongly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All double tax agreements are complex and generally only go part of the way towards meeting their objective of ensuring that income is taxed only once. Despite our closeness with New Zealand, there are some particular difficulties in negotiating a double tax agreement with that country. The agreement covers only federal taxes. In New Zealand the federal government is the major taxing authority. In Australia, however, our state governments impose significant taxes, including many which apply also to New Zealand citizens doing business in this country. New Zealand has no capital gains tax, but Australia has the harshest capital gains tax in the world. New Zealand relies more heavily on indirect taxes, including a goods and services tax, but it has a government which is more committed to expenditure restraint than the mad taxing, wild spending spree regime that Australian taxpayers must endure from their Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, Australia and New Zealand are the only two countries in the world which impose a fringe benefits tax paid by employers on the benefits received by their employees. The new double tax agreement follows the provisions of previous agreements and corresponds with Australia's other current double tax agreements. It applies to income tax, resource rent tax and fringe benefits tax and will apply to persons who are residents of one or both countries and have trans-Tasman income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new agreement does enter into some new areas and includes some special new features designed to address current taxation issues. The agreement contains a new article to deal with incomes from real property, which will be taxed in the country where the property is located. The agreement provides that visiting entertainers will continue to be taxed in the country in which they perform. However, a special arrangement has been made to accommodate the entry of the Auckland Warriors into the Australian Rugby League competition. We must be the only country in the world to put in place tax arrangements for sporting competitions before we get the events under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether this is going to be a great problem because I am not expecting the Auckland Warriors to earn much money in Australia. That is a problem that your football team would be well accustomed to, I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis. It is a matter of concern to the Brisbane Broncos, which does expect to earn a lot of money in New Zealand, Sydney and other places and wants to be treated fairly with its winnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the old arrangements, the Auckland Warriors would have had to pay tax on the money it earned for its games in Australia to the Australian government, and each of the 19 Australian based teams would have paid tax to the New Zealand government on their trips to New Zealand. In a very sensible and logical compromise, participants in the trans-Tasman rugby league competition will be taxed in the country of residence unless they are present in the other country to derive income for greater than six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another measure designed to prevent the possible double taxation of trans-Tasman fringe benefits, liability for fringe benefits tax will apply to the country that has the primary right to tax the basic remuneration of the employee. Article 22 of the agreement is a sweep-up article which sets out the rules for allocating taxing rights to other forms of income not specifically dealt with in the articles of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of clauses in the agreement concerning withholding tax on dividend, interest and royalties. While most of these provisions are reasonable, the agreement does not adequately deal, as my colleague the member for Mitchell has just said, with the difficult question of dividend imputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the agreement, Australia will reduce its rate of withholding tax on unfranked dividends paid by Australian resident companies to New Zealand residents from 30 per cent of the gross amount of dividends to 15 per cent. Franked dividends paid by Australian resident companies to New Zealand residents will continue to be exempt. However, New Zealand will continue to impose a 15 per cent withholding tax on franked dividends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is a double tax agreement which is supposed to ensure that income is not double taxed but which will in fact entrench double taxing by New Zealand on franked dividends from New Zealand resident companies with Australian shareholders. It is disappointing that the Australian government negotiators accepted a double tax agreement with this clear imbalance and disadvantage to Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can understand why the New Zealand government pursued this objective. The new agreement creates an investment bias in favour of New Zealand. New Zealand investors in Australian companies will be able to take their franked dividends home untaxed but an Australian investor in a New Zealand company will be subjected to the New Zealand government withholding tax. Of course, if the money is reinvested in New Zealand, credits are available to avoid the withholding tax. This situation is really outside the spirit of a double tax agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems with dividend imputation with double tax agreements are not confined to New Zealand. Dividend imputation credits are not a universal feature of tax systems. Indeed, many countries do not even understand what dividend imputation is, and so it is difficult to negotiate a double tax agreement which accommodates this very worthwhile initiative. I raised this and a range of other difficulties concerning the Australia-US double tax agreement with the former Treasurer more than three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A constituent of mine has a son currently resident in the United States who has confronted considerable taxation difficulties on his Australian property and investments. The failure to recognise dividend imputation in the United States means that franked dividends received by my constituent's son are, in practice, double taxed. The franked dividend is lower because the equivalent of company tax has been deducted but the remaining dividend income is still subjected to US tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A proportion of property and property trust income in Australia is tax free through such measures as depreciation allowance and some is deferred until the time of the sale of the property or units. These provisions are not, however, recognised in the US and an Australian must pay full US tax without credit on his income. In cases where the assets of property trusts are frozen by statute, an Australian is locked into a double tax situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some Australian companies give the option of taking bonus shares in lieu of a dividend, in which case the value of the dividend is free of Australian tax. The United States will not recognise this, and an Australian living in the US must pay full tax on the dividend equivalent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules applying to capital gains tax are also vastly different. An Australian who takes up residency in the United States can become liable for US capital gains tax on Australian property which would not be taxable if it were sold while he was living in Australia. This is particularly the case if the property was owned prior to the introduction of capital gains tax in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent advises me that US capital gains tax is set at a flat rate of 28 per cent and is payable on the total difference between the purchase and sale prices without any allowance for inflation. When an Australian becomes a non-resident for income tax purposes he must pay Australian capital gains tax on the deemed market value after CPI indexation on the day of departing Australia. That Australian, when deemed to be a US resident must, on the sale of the Australian assets still in Australia, pay full US capital gains tax on the non-indexed difference between the purchase price and the sale price, not simply on the difference between the sale price and the market value on the date of entering the USA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised these issues with the Treasurer of the day, the Hon. John Dawkins, in a letter of 28 January 1992. In his reply, then Treasurer Dawkins acknowledged that changes in tax laws had resulted in some inadequacies in the USA-Australia double tax agreement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A DTA has as its primary objectives the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion. In practice, the passage of time may result in a DTA's objectives being attained to a lesser extent than when it first came into operation.</PARA>

With respect to this, the views of your constituent have been noted and will be considered in any forthcoming re-negotiation of that DTA.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer's reply included the clear implication that the government was about to commence negotiations with the United States on a new double tax agreement. However, when I had heard nothing further about the progress of these negotiations 18 months later, I put questions on notice to the Treasurer to ascertain what progress had been made. On 15 December 1993, the Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear)&mdash;whom I notice has re-entered the chamber to make sure that any amendments he might be proposing are not forgotten on this particular piece of legislation&mdash;replied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer's reply represented a complete turnaround, it seemed, in the government's attitude. No, there were no problems with the existing Australia-USA double tax agreement. Changes to the income tax laws of either country had not given rise to double taxation. There was no double taxation on capital gains. Double taxation should not occur in regard to bonus issues of shares or on the income of business trusts and property. Then, in a further insult to our intelligence, the Assistant Treasurer claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . double taxation should not occur as a result of the dividend imputation system because franked dividends paid by Australian companies to overseas shareholders are exempt under Australian tax laws and dividend withholding tax to the extent that they are franked.</PARA>
<PARA>Not much of what the Assistant Treasurer said in his response to my question was completely accurate. It was a direct contradiction of the comments of the former Treasurer almost two years earlier. As has been demonstrated by previous speakers in this debate, there are difficulties with this question of franked dividends and the issue of double taxation arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many overseas governments do not recognise the fact that tax has been paid on franked dividends in the country of operation and thus should not be subject to further tax in the home country of offshore shareholders. I recognise that this issue is not easy and that, in negotiating a double tax agreement, parties seek to maintain for their own country whatever competitive advantage they might be able to obtain. In spite of all the rhetoric about taxation fairness that usually surrounds a double tax agreement, self-interest is only vaguely disguised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the only way that international tax fairness could occur would be to have a uniform system of taxation around the world. I doubt that that will ever occur; nor is it necessarily desirable. Many countries use a favourable taxation regime to encourage investment and they are certainly not going to trade off that advantage easily. Indeed, Australia with its harsh system of business taxation, mountainous bureaucracy and endless paper work has often been the loser. Many Australian companies have chosen to relocate overseas to escape our punitive taxation regime. On the other hand, most of the burgeoning economic tigers of Asia and the Americas have attracted investment on the basis of favourable tax treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent has suggested that Australia could address the issue of double taxation of franked dividends independent of double tax agreements by amending Australian legislation so that an Australian company paying franked dividends would not pay Australian company tax on the dividends which are paid to non-resident shareholders, but instead pay the full amount&mdash;that is, the equivalent of the franked dividend plus the imputed credit or company tax&mdash;as an unfranked dividend but with a larger withholding tax deducted equivalent to the amount which would have been paid as company tax. Non-resident shareholders who are residents of the United States, for instance, for income tax purposes would then be taxed on the full cashed amount but would receive a US tax credit for that withholding tax up to the amount of the US tax which they would have been liable to pay on that dividend, and therefore the double taxation would be avoided. While my constituent's suggestion would have added some complexity, it would be fairer to shareholders of Australian companies and would also provide encouragement for investment in Australia by overseas shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the article `Gittins on Saturday' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> dealing with dividend imputation and the benefits that would accrue through it to foreign investors, the point was made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many haven't quite caught on to the fact that company tax is now aimed at foreign shareholders, but not at domestic shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, dividend imputation without double taxation agreements has a significantly greater impact on foreign shareholders. The current New Zealand situation could provide an incentive for investment in that country. There are benefits if the money is retained in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia-New Zealand double tax agreement is certainly an improvement on the existing arrangements and in that regard it is welcomed. It could lead to more Australian investment in New Zealand as it clarifies some of the anomalies which have arisen since the last treaty. I suspect that there will be less reciprocal advantage. The agreement, however, has not resolved the problem of mutual recognition of dividend imputation rebates and it has not addressed the inequity in the imposition by New Zealand of this withholding tax of 15 per cent. New Zealand has protected its revenue, but Australian citizens who are shareholders in companies operating in New Zealand are the losers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will not be opposed by the opposition because it is an advance, but it could have been so much better. We are disappointed that more was not achieved in this particular area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to thank all those who took part in the debate on the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill 1995 today and maybe make just a few points in closing the debate. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), talked about tax treatment in Asia and the way in which countries in Asia might attract foreign investment. I point out to him that the social security net we have is not a feature of those economies. If he wants to compare tax treatment as a single issue, that is fine, but there is more to attracting companies to a particular country than tax treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, with our regional headquarters policy, Australia has been very successful in attracting major corporations to position themselves here. In looking at our tax treatment compared with Asia, I remind the honourable member that the company tax rate is now at 33c but would have been at 42c had the opposition won the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the previous speaker also said that the capital gains tax in Australia was the most onerous in the world. He knows that is not true. The simple fact is that ours is fully indexed for inflation. There are not too many countries around the world where the real rate is applied to the capital gains tax. So once again he is wrong in making that assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to respond to a couple of the claims made by the opposition about the taxation treatment of trans-Tasman dividends. I do not want to add any more words to what my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) said in explaining why agreement could not be reached on the mutual recognition of imputation credits. He also explained that while Australia pressed for a zero rate of withholding tax on New Zealand dividends, New Zealand would not agree to it. There are two parties to any agreement; there has to be agreement on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although that issue has not been resolved, the new agreement makes a number of major improvements in a range of areas. I read those out in my second reading speech. Given the fact that we could not reach agreement on all of those things, I think members would agree that it is not worth holding up this agreement, and all the benefits that will flow from it, because we could not get agreement on every issue. That is why the bill is in here now. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends 10 bills administered within the transport portfolio. Most of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent a finetuning and clarification of provisions of various acts within the portfolio. The amendments do not introduce substantial new policies. I do not propose to deal with the minor technical amendments in this speech, but instead will concentrate upon the more significant amendments contained in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of amendments to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990, the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 and the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 which implement some revised accountability arrangements applying to Commonwealth authorities and government business enterprises. They provide for ministerial notices about the strategic direction of the enterprises, the supply of information to ministers and ministerial nominees, the payment of interim dividends, the appointment of chief executive officers and acting chief executive officers by boards and, in the case of the Australian National Railways Commission, the setting of financial targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority are currently employed under the Public Service Act 1922. The government considers that this arrangement is not compatible with the proposed accountability standards. Accordingly, employment of staff of the authority will be removed from the ambit of the Public Service Act 1922. Staff of the authority will now be appointed and employed under conditions determined by the authority. It should be noted however that a person employed by the authority before the commencement of this amendment shall be taken, immediately after the commencement, to be employed under the same terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By amendment of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, the bill increases to the equivalent of $500,000 the liability limits in respect of passenger death or injury for Australian international carriers. These amendments complement regulations made in October 1994 under that act which increased to $500,000 the passenger liability limit for domestic carriers and foreign carriers whose states of registry are not parties to the Warsaw Convention. Australia cannot, consistent with its international obligations under the Warsaw Convention, impose higher liability limits in respect of foreign international carriers whose states of registry are parties to that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I consider it important that all passengers carried to and from Australia are provided with the same level of protection. Accordingly, the Department of Transport will approach the relevant foreign carriers requesting them to increase their limits to the same level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 currently provides for the fitting of a compliance plate to indicate that a vehicle meets national standards. The administration of this scheme is being made more flexible by introducing `identification plates' which will indicate a vehicle's status in relation to compliance with the national standards. The range of identification plates will include the existing compliance plates and allow for the determination of different types of plates, how they are to be fitted and, in some cases, allow for the imposition of conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a number of amendments to the Navigation Act 1912. Firstly, that act is being amended to prevent a seafarer from claiming compensation for injury under both the act and the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992, thereby preventing possible double dipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, part IV of the Navigation Act is being amended to enable Australia to adopt a resolution of the International Maritime Organisation that will permit the early implementation of a system of ship survey and certification that is harmonised between the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, the International Convention on Load Lines 1966 and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973. The harmonised system will standardise the duration of certificates issued under the three conventions. The costs of these requirements to shipowners will be reduced as it will be possible to program several surveys at the same time and there is greater flexibility in the times at which surveys can be arranged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the act is amended to incorporate the terms and principles adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in its International Convention on Salvage 1989. The convention provides greater incentives for effective and timely salvage operations and to assist with the protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the bill amends offence provisions in the act relating to the abuse of alcohol and other drugs by seafarers. In view of the government's responsibility to ensure the safety of life at sea and to protect the marine environment, it is considered necessary to provide an objective standard of impairment by alcohol and drugs, and to prescribe forms of tests similar to those in other transport modes&mdash;a matter near and dear to your heart, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is important. The maritime industry has been consulted and generally supports the introduction of standards and prescribed methods of testing of impairment due to alcohol or other drugs. The industry for its part will introduce and promote policies and practices to control and regulate the use of alcohol and drugs by persons employed in ships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the government has taken the opportunity in amending the Navigation Act to remove a large number of outdated and sexist references in that act. The amendments to the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Act 1986 will enable Australia to accede to the 1992 protocol amending the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been a party to the parent treaty, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 (Civil Liability Convention), since 1984. The primary objective of the Civil Liability Convention is to create a system of compulsory oil pollution liability insurance for the owners of oil tankers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 protocol was developed to overcome the effects of inflation on the real values of the limits of liability. For vessels of less than 5,000 gross tons the protocol envisages liability of three million special drawing rights, as defined by the International Monetary Fund. This is equivalent to approximately $A5.8 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For larger vessels, liability is calculated on the basis of the vessels tonnage, with an overall maximum for the ship's liability of 59.7 million special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund, or $A114.5 million. These levels ensure that the damage that such a ship can cause will be more effectively compensated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compensation available under Civil Liability Convention is supplemented by a separate convention, known as the fund convention, which will shortly enter into force for Australia. Other amendments effected by the 1992 Civil Liability Convention Protocol include extension of the geographic scope of the convention to cover incidents occurring in the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. This will afford additional protection to sensitive areas such as the Great Barrier Reef and safeguard existing and potential fisheries in the Australian fishing zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the legislation will also be extended as tankers in ballast and combination carriers are now included in the coverage of the Civil Liability Convention. It is interesting that the IMO has also accepted the Barrier Reef as the world's first sensitive region for these purposes. That is an aside but it is of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 protocol replaces an earlier 1984 protocol, which Australia acceded to in June 1988. The 1984 protocol was expressed to enter into force when ratified by 10 countries, including six which have at least one million gross tons of tanker tonnage. While 13 countries, including Australia, have ratified the protocol to date, only two have the required minimum tanker tonnage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years the International Maritime Organisation, which administers the convention, has recognised that the 1984 protocol is unlikely to gain the required ratification by countries with the minimum tonnage unless it is ratified by the United States, the world's leading oil importer. This is now unlikely to occur, as the liability provisions of the United States' Oil Pollution Act 1990 are inconsistent with those of the CLC Protocol and therefore preclude US ratification. As a result, the 1992 protocol was adopted as a replacement protocol, with the only substantive alteration to the earlier protocol being a less restrictive entry into force provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 will reduce the maximum crew level for eligibility for a grant from 23 to 18. This accords with the existing crewing practices in the Australian Trading Fleet. I might add that earlier today a number of amendments which the government proposes to move when the House considers the bill in the consideration in detail stage were circulated to members in the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He portrayed this money power as an intense conspiracy to enslave the working class, writing that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whosoever controls the banks controls industry. This group is designated `the Money Power' . . . an oligarchy of financiers working towards the same despotic end . . . human bloodsuckers, who risk neither life nor limb nor penny, wax fat on Arma geddon. </PARA>
<PARA>While representing a primitive and popular style of politics not uncommon during the early decades of this century, Anstey went further, adding a strongly racial component to his economic nationalism. He argued that Jewish bankers were at the centre of the money power conspiracy. I will now read from page 5 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Kingdom of Shylock</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and the member for Wills should listen. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After Medina came the Jew, Lopez . . . he bought on the slump and sold on the rise. Then came Samson Gideon and the Goldsmids&mdash;Abraham and Benjamin. They were succeeded by the Rothschilds.</PARA>
<PARA>Anstey went on to write how it is not a question of class or class interests; the class struggle will disappear with the exterminated interests of the predatory clique&mdash;that is, the Jewish money power. I am appalled and saddened that the member for Wills could endorse Anstey and these views. It is, nonetheless, important in public life to bring sacred cows to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his crazed rush to criticise the ALP, the member for Wills has overlooked the core reason why modern Labor has had cause to condemn the money power thesis. It is based on intolerance. It is based on racism and anti-Semitism of the worst kind. In his 1984 publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor and the Money Power</EMPHASIS>, Peter Love records how:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This anti-Semitism in the Kingdom of Shylock was no aberration. It arose from the logic of (Anstey's) analysis combined with the cultural tradition of which he was a part. Christian mythology had built up an accretion of hatred and suspicion towards Jews over many centuries. The resulting stereotype of the greedy and cunning Jewish financier was a commonplace convention in the writings of British radicals and American populists . . . It was hardly surprising that a man of Anstey's background should have chosen to invoke such a stereotype . . . the ultimate force of this argument depended on the willingness of his audience to accept the racist assumptions on which the stereotype was based.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Wills is not of Labor. He does not appreciate Labor history nor the culture of our movement. I hope this explains his lapse in the House three weeks ago. If not, I urge him to clarify it tonight and explain his views on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Money Power</EMPHASIS> and its anti-Semitic approach as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share a concern with many members in this House that the chief political adviser of the member for Wills is Bill Hartley&mdash;publicly notorious for his anti-Semitic views. He is on the record as a strong anti-Semitic public figure. Moreover, I urge the member for Wills to update and broaden his approach to politics. In truth, his type of economic nationalism has always relied on an exceedingly narrow, unenlightened and xenophobic view of Australia's future. The member for Wills has pinned his ideology to the post-federation Australian settlement; that is, tariff protection all round, centralised industrial relations and economic nationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in this House should be misled by the motives underpinning this approach. These were social values based on a belief in the supremacy of a white, Anglo-Saxon, male dominated culture in Australia. Egalitarianism was expressed only in the context of this narrow social framework. While Australian men treated their mates as equals and while good blokes always received a fair go, Asian trade was locked out by tariff walls, and non-Anglo-Saxon migrants were excluded by the white Australia policy. Domestically, women were denied social opportunities, and Aborigines were comprehensively repressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered, for instance, that when Frank Anstey campaigned against conscription during World War I he did so fearful that conscripts sent to Europe would be replaced in the Australian labour market by Asians. This is the same Anstey held out by the member for Wills as a bloke with a bit of spirit and moral courage. It does not take courage to discriminate. The member for Wills should not endorse those views. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After question time today a matter of public importance on Aboriginal health was moved by the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). While I acknowledge that the member for Chisholm has genuine concerns about Aboriginal health and social justice issues, I would not ever say that the same philosophies are shared by his colleagues on that side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the opposition has a bit of gall coming in here and lecturing us about Aboriginal health, or any other area of social policy. As far as Aboriginal health or Aboriginal issues are concerned, the problems of Aboriginal people in Australia started not in 1983, as the opposition would have us believe, but in 1788, about 195 years earlier. That was the year when we had British settlement or, as some people would say, a British invasion of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1788, as we all know, there has been a sorry tale of discrimination, dispossession and general disadvantage suffered by the indigenous people of this country. It has continued from 1788 through to the present day. Until 1901 we did not have a national government; we had six state governments. In 1901 with federation we adopted the constitution that we hear lots of talk about from the opposition; how we have a constitution that we must uphold and which must never change. That constitution, apart from not even recognising Aboriginal people, entrenched significant power in state governments, power which remains today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot from the opposition about states' rights and how state governments have responsibilities for this and that. Whenever anybody on this side of the House mentions that we are concerned about the way some state governments deliver these responsibilities, we get a lecture about states' rights and the constitution, not to mention the monarchy, the flag and everything else the opposition uses as a replacement for any lack of policy it might have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1901 we had the constitution. State governments&mdash;then and now&mdash;have primary responsibility for the delivery of health services, amongst many other things. So to come in here and blame the federal government that has been in for 12 years for the problems of Aboriginal health, is the height of hypocrisy. In 1967 we had a referendum. It was one of the few useful things I can remember a coalition government doing&mdash;even if it took it 18 years to make it happen. Nevertheless, we did have a referendum which now enables Commonwealth governments to pass legislation to implement policy in relation to indigenous people. That is what we have tried to do with ATSIC and with the Native Title Act, which was vigorously opposed by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, do you remember the main obstacle in passing the Native Title Act? It was not the mining companies, Aboriginal people, pastoralists or even the Senate; it was state governments. They were the main obstacles because property rights and land management rights were the province of state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House that state governments also have primary responsibility for health, just as they have for housing and some other areas such as education; areas in which Aboriginal people continue to suffer major disadvantage and discrimination in comparison with the rest of the Australian community. It is not only Aboriginal health which is a problem, there is a problem with mental health. A couple of years ago there was a report called the Burdekin report. Brian Burdekin was very critical of mental health services and the lack of them. He was very critical of state governments which had almost an exclusive role in that area until the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Burdekin was also critical of the Commonwealth government. He is critical of it because he says that it is up to us as a Commonwealth government to make the states perform and deliver and not to use the excuse that it is a state responsibility. I happen to agree with that but it is very difficult, whether we are talking about Aboriginal health, mental health, housing or any other area of government responsibility, to try to get some sense into the structure of government and Commonwealth-state responsibilities when one side of politics in Australia, the opposition, has no policies, no commitment to social justice and only seems to stand for the Queen, the constitution and states' rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While so many Australians are unemployed because of the inept economic policies of the last decade, the federal government has been forced to divide unemployed people into categories and direct most of its funding towards those people who have been unemployed for the longest time. The long-term unemployed have become the clear focus of the government's job strategy. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) professes to have a particular concern for the long-term unemployed. He has told us that he does not want to leave them behind. But one odd statement he made at the Press Club last year makes it seems as though the Prime Minister is slightly nervous about the long-term unemployed and is waiting for them to riot. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . even though there are long term unemployed people in Australia, we live in peace with each other.</PARA>
<PARA>We have close to half a million long-term unemployed. He makes them sound like a restless vigilante group or a clan from another country. It is no wonder he is nervous about the long-term unemployed. Australians who have been out of work for years are becoming much more frustrated and have little faith in this government which has had over a decade to deal with unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, tonight I would like to touch on those people who are not yet long-term unemployed. They are the short-term unemployed, if you like. These are people who have recently joined the unemployment queues and are desperate to get back into the work force before they become another long-term unemployment statistic. Several constituents have contacted me because they are frustrated with the lack of help available from government programs, unless they have been classified as the long-term unemployed. It is a vicious circle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These people must virtually wait for themselves to become long-term unemployed before the government will help them. Take, for example, a young man from Lock, a small town in my electorate of Grey: he was unemployed for some months and then enrolled in a TAFE course. Following that course he was registered as unemployed again, and continued to be so for the following eight months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> He then learned of a job vacancy in the town&mdash;a rare event in small communities in regional Australia. He applied for the job. However, he was not eligible for the Labor government's jobstart program because he had not been unemployed for 12 consecutive months&mdash;the emphasis being on the word `consecutive'. If he had not undertaken the TAFE course and had remained on unemployment benefits, he could have had a shot at the job. As it was, he was penalised for extending his education and straying from the dole queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This adherence to an unbroken 12 months of unemployment and unwavering focus on the long-term unemployed is unfair and unreasonable. While I understand that we focus on those people who have been out of work for the longest, it is callous and wrong to deny any unemployed person in a situation such as I have just described. We are neglecting those people who have been out of work for less than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the forgotten unemployed, with unequal access to the government's programs. They have to earn their colours first. They have to be unemployed an entire year before they can get a look-in&mdash;and all because this government has created so much unemployment that it only has the resources to direct assistance to a few. With latest indications that Working Nation programs are falling behind targets, one does not hold out much hope for any unemployed people under the Keating government. The short-term unemployed, in particular, have a long wait ahead of them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Perth)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">7.51 p.m.)&mdash;Tonight I again want to refer to an important banking and finance issue in my state of Western Australia&mdash;the proposed privatisation of the state owned bank, Bankwest, and its possible merger with the privately owned Challenge Bank. I spoke on this matter in November of last year and said that, subject to a number of reservations as to detail, I supported both the privatisation process and the merger. Those reservations were in ensuring that any privatised Bankwest bank had its headquarters in Western Australia and that any involuntary staff reductions were taken seriously and viewed very cautiously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I note that the leader of the state parliamentary Labor Party, Mr Jim McGinty, has recently made some critical comments in this respect. I concur with those remarks and I will refer to them in more detail later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My key reason for supporting the privatisation and merger process is that I believe that process would ensure that Western Australia had a strong regional bank. In my speech last November I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear the Premier of Western Australia saying that he would not be rushed or bulldozed into a decision on this matter. I think that is right. This is a serious policy issue for the state which requires serious consideration and which needs to be looked at carefully. While on the surface the Challenge offer or proposal seems to be an attractive option, there may well be other issues which go to the benefit of the state, which have not yet been the subject of public comment and which the government of Western Australia is currently considering.</PARA>
<PARA>I then went on to detail how a number of commentators&mdash;Stephen Bartholomeusz from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, Ivor Ries from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and Brian Frith from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;had described the Challenge proposal as `irresistible', `compelling' and `a beautiful fit'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There have been a number of developments since that time which I would like to outline to the House. On 15 February, word eked out that it was proposed to axe 200 jobs at Bankwest's head office. The leader of the state opposition, Mr Jim McGinty, issued a press release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plans to axe up to 200 jobs at Bank West's head office have jeopardised Labor's support for the sale of the State bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shadow cabinet voted last November to support the bank's privatisation subject to the following conditions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-The process being open, fair and accountable to the Parliament and the people;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-The bank remaining headquartered in Western Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-The impact on staff levels and infrastructure be given serious consideration; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-The Government seeking the maximum return it can gain, subject to the above conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>I was pleased that, as a result of Mr McGinty's statement, officials from the bank subsequently described those proposed involuntary reductions as `reductions which would occur through a process of natural attrition'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second development which has occurred has been a change of chairman at Bankwest. That is alluded to in an article by Mr Nigel Wilson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 21 February which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While BankWest senior management is keen on the full float, the Perth business community is waiting to see the attitude of the new BankWest chairman, Mr Ian Mackenzie, who took over from Dr Ross Garnaut this month.</PARA>
<PARA>The third development that we have seen&mdash;which, in a sense, is the most important&mdash;has been the recent announcement by Premier Court and the state government that all options would now be seriously considered by the state government. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 24 February:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the State Government yesterday said that it would "formally investigative options for the sale of the bank in tandem with preparations for a public float".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Premier, Mr Court, said that while the Government's preferred option remained a 100 per cent sharemarket float it had a responsibility to investigate other options.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased about that sensible development. I compliment the Premier on that sensible approach to a major issue for Western Australia. In the same report there is a related story written by Nigel Wilson under the heading, `WA Govt does a backflip'. I think that is a bit harsh, but what is important is the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously BankWest management was dismissive of the Challenge proposal, but the latest announcement may reflect the influence of the new chairman, Mr Ian Mackenzie, who took over from Dr Ross Garnaut earlier this month.</PARA>
<PARA>I have never been able to understand the apparently so ideologically blinkered view of Dr Garnaut in his refusal to countenance a proper examination of all the options on this matter in the face of overwhelming evidence that it was both in the public interest and in the state interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that Mr Mackenzie has taken that approach and that Premier Court has sensibly taken this advice. I look forward to further sensible consideration of this major issue for Western Australia, ensuring that Western Australia, as a growth state with close links to the Asian region, has a strong regional bank. </PARA>

Mr Speaker, you will recall that was the period of the disastrous Ash Wednesday fires. I say to you and the members of this House that the efforts of the Country Fire Authority and all of the emergencies services during that period were outstanding. I know that approximately 650 volunteers were ready and willing to participate and help in fighting the fires in Ballarat. They did a magnificent job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Country Fire Authority has over 100,000 volunteers. When the fires broke out in New South Wales many members of the Country Fire Authority in Victoria who were on stand-by went to the fires in New South Wales.

They did not have one moment of hesitation, they volunteered to go, they were asked to go; and they did a magnificent job, as did all of the other Victorian brigades that went to assist the New South Wales rural fire brigades. It was a traumatic time for New South Wales. I know that the help given by the fire services in Victoria played a major part in assisting New South Wales to overcome some of the difficulties that they were in. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Telecommunications Authority (AUSTEL) is required under section 399 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 to report annually to the Minister for Communications on competitive safeguards and carrier performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AUSTEL's latest report on competitive safeguards and carrier performance covers the 1993-94 financial year. The report contains analysis of the benefits that consumers have received during that year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Optus commenced offering mobile phone services in June 1992 and long distance trunk and international services in November 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the comments made by AUSTEL on pricing outcomes and the benefits received by consumers during 1992-94 were:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the advent of competition, prices have been reduced through both reductions in standard charges as well as an increasing number of pricing options which customers can select to suit their calling profile. The price reductions over both 1992/93 and 1993/94 have been significant and are attributable to both the effect of the price capping arrangements applying to Telecom and the impact of the competition in the market by the entrance of Optus and Vodafone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compared with the prices available for domestic and international long distance calls and mobile services at the start of 1992/93, Optus' entry into the market has made even larger price reductions available to consumers than those implemented by Telecom to meet the price cap arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1992/93 there was a 3.6 per cent reduction in Telecom's average revenue-weighted prices. Telecom has significantly reduced prices for domestic and international long-distance calls and mobile services. In particular, the price reductions calculated for price cap purposes show that international prices fell by 11.6 per cent, STD prices fell by 4 per cent and mobile prices, on average, fell by 8.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1993/94 there was a 3.7 per cent reduction in Telecom's average revenue-weighted prices. The price reductions calculated for price cap purposes show that international prices fell by 8.7 per cent, STD prices fell by 5.5 per cent and mobile prices, on average, fell by 7.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 3.7 per cent reduction to charges for price-capped services by Telecom, in 1993-94, represents a transfer of benefit to customers of about $315 million. This was slightly above the revenue reduction achieved in 1992-93 of about $300 million. This is based on an analysis of how much consumers would have had to pay to use the same quantity of services (in total) priced at start of year prices compared with the prices applicable at the end of the period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more significant price reductions in 1992-94 have been in the areas where Optus has entered the market and provided competition to Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Optus' entry into the market and the changes implemented by Telecom has seen a rapid growth on the range of choice of service and pricing options available to consumers. In particular, the increased use of Flexi-Plans by Telecom, de-averaged trunk prices, the introduction of per-second charging for long-distance calls, and the significant use of short-term introductory and promotional discounts by both carriers has dramatically increased information and choice to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While all consumers of standard telephone services received price benefits in real terms over 1992-94, the benefits were, to some extent, differentially shared between different groups of consumers. The level of benefit received during 1992-94 was heavily dependent on the calling patterns and service usage of individual consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Telecom and Optus provide AUSTEL with details on the costs associated with service groupings on a commercial-in-confidence basis. AUSTEL is unable to furnish this information to a third party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it can be said that the introduction of network-based competition provides Telecom with an incentive to improve its rates of productivity and minimise underlying costs. Telecom have advised that it has engaged in a cost rationalisation process in order to increase its level of efficiency. In addition, I understand that Telecom has been able to reduce its costs through increased utilisation of the latest generation of telecommunications infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition also encourages Telecom to adjust its prices so that they better reflect underlying costs. In this regard, the most significant falls in prices have been for international, STD and mobile calls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Department of Communications and the Arts monitors developments in price movements on an ongoing basis, using a wide range of sources. It contributes regularly to work on, and discussion of, these issues undertaken by the OECD and other international and domestic fora. In addition to this, </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a review of the current price control arrangements is currently underway and a review of telecommunications policy and regulatory arrangements in general has also commenced.</PARA>
