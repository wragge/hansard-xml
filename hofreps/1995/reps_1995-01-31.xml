If the clerks are to adopt that format, would it not be appropriate for you, Mr Speaker, too to wear a gown?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it is a surprise to many of us that we are welcomed back with the resurrection of the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994, and that this legislation has been given priority at the beginning of this year. There has been a widespread view in the community that the government has been unable to win much support for its legislation and that it has given up altogether on the whole idea of country of origin labelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After being long promised, this legislation was introduced into the parliament on 23 March last year. In a welcome and historic precedent, it has been subjected to inquiry by committees from both the House of Representatives and the Senate. This is certainly legislation that Australia needs and wants but, in this form, it is rejected by almost all. When the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) spoke on this bill on 19 October, she foreshadowed a small number of government amendments. While these amendments are an improvement, there is still widespread criticism about the content of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's bill has been opposed by the Australian Consumers Association, the National Council of Women, the Country Womens Association, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Housewives Association, Women in Agriculture, the National Farmers Federation and almost every farm organisation in the country, the Pork Council of Australia, the National Fishing Industry Council and the Winegrape Growers Council. If that is not enough, it is also opposed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and a host of other unions, including the Automotive, Food, Metal and Engineering Union, the Public Sector Union, the National Union of Workers, trades and labour councils from several states and many other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For different reasons, reservations about the legislation have also been expressed by the Advance Australia Foundation, the Australian Owned Companies Association, the Canned Food Information Service and the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia. Has the minister got any friends left at all? Indeed, the minister has been spending some time trying to persuade the legislation's detractors, but the critics certainly remain. She has attended some hostile meetings. She has been running away from trade union officials and everyone over recent times. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Ms McHugh" NAMEID="ZH4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZH4">Ms McHugh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never left a hostile meeting on this&mdash;ever.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but you have faced some hostile meetings and you have failed to persuade anyone that you have got your legislation right. One can only ask why the government is pursuing this legislation which it knows is opposed by a broad cross-section of the community&mdash;including many of Labor's traditional friends&mdash;and which it knows the coalition must seek to amend. Obviously, the legislation has been dragged off a dusty shelf for crass political reasons. The government is desperately trying to secure for itself a trigger for a double dissolution election later this year. It knows that it cannot get control of the Senate at a normal election. It is scared that its years of economic mismanagement and irresponsible spending are finally coming home to rest and that an election will be unwinnable for it by the end of this term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this legislation is going to do is put the government further in the mire. Its approach to this legislation demonstrates Labor's utter arrogance in government. Despite having almost a year to respond to public concerns about the content of the legislation, the minister refuses to make the necessary changes. She knows what is right; the people are all wrong. That is the reason why the people are welcoming this year as a new beginning for the coalition and the beginning of the end for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation could have provided a wonderful new opportunity for a new beginning for Australian industry and an opportunity to promote genuine Australian products. With the decline in international trade barriers and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation, a much more liberal trading environment is establishing around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a strong vested interest in promoting freer trade. We have a relatively small domestic market and to develop world-class industries we often need the economies of scale that can only be provided by selling our products to more populous countries. On the other hand, some other countries see Australia as a potential market for their goods. Some of those goods are the best in the world and will naturally be chosen by some Australian consumers but others are of doubtful quality and add little of value to our marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some industries market share has been lost to imports and this has caused considerable economic and social damage especially in regions which are dependent upon particular industries. Consequently, many buy Australian campaigns have been launched around the nation. The federal government itself has spent more than $15 million promoting the buy Australian campaign over recent years and these initiatives have been supported by many local campaigns. In my own home town of Kingaroy the local newspaper the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS> in association with the Queensland Grain Growers Association and other primary industry and community organisations have undertaken a major local `buy Aussie' campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These campaigns have been very successful, and there is a strong desire among Australian consumers to buy Australian products. A recent survey by Coles revealed that 89 per cent of shoppers prefer to buy Australian, and that percentage has been increasing. Even more revealing was the fact that 60 per cent of shoppers were prepared to pay a 10 per cent premium to buy items made in this country and nearly 70 per cent said they would purchase Australian produce even if the quality of the imported goods was slightly better. They know they can contribute to our national economic security and progress by buying Australian. They know that shoppers who buy foreign made goods contribute just as surely to our country's national debt as do high-flying entrepreneurs or overspending governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coles, in a recent campaign, used the slogan, `Buy Australian and buy your kids a job'. This slogan really puts another important element of the case for purchasing Australian goods clearly and succinctly. John Corboy of SPC said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People need to understand the issue is not just a short-term marketing issue but strikes at the very heart of maintaining jobs for our children in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>It could also be said that buying Australian is the only guarantee of buying goods that meet Australia's quality standards. Nowhere is that more significant than in buying food. All Australian food producers are required to meet rigid health and quality standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent series of articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> its rural editor, Gordon Collie, reported on information he had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act regarding imported food. He said that between 1 July 1993 and 17 March 1994 there were 142 instances recorded where imported foods did not comply with Australia's food safety or standard requirements&mdash;142 cases!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most common breaches were in peanuts and seafoods, but the list of violations covered more than 30 food categories from 28 countries. China was by far the worst offending country with 44 consignments failing to meet food standards, many being peanuts contaminated with cadmium. But AQIS, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, only undertakes sporadic inspections of imports and, while certain high risk areas are targeted, who knows how many shipments have actually entered the country and been sold to Australian consumers that could not have met local standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more alarming is that, of the 142 instances which AQIS detected, only 33 of the food consignments were actually destroyed; 32 were re-exported to another country, presumably where the standards were not so high. But in many instances the consignments had already been distributed. In the case of 20 failing shipments AQIS notified the relevant state health authorities but advised Mr Collie, `AQIS is unaware of what action, if any, was taken.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are many good reasons why Australians should buy locally produced products. They cannot, however, be assured of buying Australian unless our nation has a fair and honest labelling system. Too often manufacturers intent on exploiting the Australian desire to buy locally produced products have attempted to give the impression of Australianness, even for products that are fully imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large flag, a kangaroo, or words like `Designed in Australia' and even `Made in Australia' are sometimes used on products with foreign ingredients. I have brought along today a classic example of that. This was brought to my attention in my own electorate. I have here an enlarged copy of a packet which on the front states `Australian traditional honey-roasted peanuts'. To add to the image there appears a 1950s version farm truck with the words on the door `Kingaroy peanut farm'. The label on the back of the packet reads `Enjoy our combination of the world's finest peanuts'&mdash;a slogan Kingaroy uses to promote its peanuts&mdash;`enriched with a traditional Australian honey-roasted recipe'. It is only right down at the bottom of the packet that the words `Product of USA' appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the kind of dishonest advertising that I think everyone believes should be stamped out. Perhaps ironically, these goods were on sale in a supermarket in Kingaroy. The company really picked the wrong place to launch its product. In fairness, the company, when this labelling was brought to its attention, withdrew the product from the marketplace. But it is an example of the kind of thing that I am sure the minister wishes to stamp out and which the coalition also believes ought to be stamped out. Frankly, it is dishonest and it is probably a breach of existing trade practices legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation certainly gives us the opportunity to get it right for the future. The coalition enthusiastically supports the concept of truthful country of origin labelling. It is disappointing, therefore, that the government has got it so wrong. There are a number of areas of concern, many of which were outlined by my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) when he responded to this legislation on behalf of the coalition last October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the coalition believes in country of origin legislation, we will be proposing amendments to the legislation to make it more in keeping with the wishes of the Australian public and the majority of Australian industry in this matter. The bill proposes that the terms `Produce of Australia' and `Product of Australia' can be used on items where the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods is Australia and where all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods is Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation gives a lesser status to the term `Made in Australia', which will be able to be used on goods which acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia but could include imported ingredients. This flies in the face of public opinion and is against the will of consumer organisations, the trade union movement, the rural sector and much of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent Quadrant survey, 74 per cent of consumers stated that products labelled `Made in Australia' should not contain imported ingredients. In the CSIRO national nutrition survey of January 1994, 98 per cent agreed that food should not be labelled Australian unless it is both grown and processed entirely within Australia. Ninety-eight per cent is not a bad popularity rating. Even the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) would be thankful for a popularity rating of 98 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that only the Minister for Consumer Affairs and perhaps one or two of her colleagues are left thinking that the words `Made in Australia' should be allowed to be used on goods with foreign ingredients. The government itself has spent $15 million promoting the opposite view. This legislation overturns all of that effort and destroys years of carefully nurtured campaigning. The government is now proposing to spend a mere three-quarters of a million dollars over two years to persuade the public that everything they believed in the past and everything they had been told by the government in the past no longer applies. This is clearly a stupid way for the government to be proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret to the government that there are concerns about this particular matter. Many representations have been made to it by organisations around the country. In its magazine, the consumers' organisation has quite loudly condemned the government's downgrading of the term `Made in Australia'. Yesterday, I received a letter from the Pork Council of Australia Ltd which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe it is important to have `Made in Australia' mean precisely what consumers think it means.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we should not try to reinvent the English language or try to persuade people to believe something contrary to the government's promotional efforts over the years. This concern is also expressed in a letter from Mr Martin Ferguson, the President of the ACTU. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill's focus on representations about Australian origin carried on consumer goods supplied in Australia fails to recognise the widely-held public perception that goods marked `Made in Australia' denotes that Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the product on offer.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not Martin Ferguson speaking alone, as the minister suggested in one of her media releases. Mr Ferguson emphasises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU Executive has unanimously endorsed this submission to change two sections of the Bill in order to address our concern.</PARA>
<PARA>There is widespread concern about the government's action in seeking to downgrade the importance and meaning of the term `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is proposing amendments which faithfully take up these concerns and elevate the term `Made in Australia' to a similar status as that of `Product of Australia'. In that way, Australians who buy a product that has the words `Made in Australia' on it will be getting something that is genuinely Australian. People believe that it is genuinely Australian. This legislation should not interfere with those views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have been raised in many other areas, including the question of regional labelling. These concerns have emanated especially from Tasmania, but they have been raised in other states as well. This matter has been raised in some areas where the name of the town has been proudly promoted as part of the origin statement&mdash;`Made in Bendigo', `Product of Ballarat', `Made in Wangaratta' and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, as it was originally drafted, would have resulted in mortal damage to that terminology. It is true that the minister has acknowledged that failing and is now proposing some amendments which the coalition has indicated a willingness to support. However, there will still be some problems for the users of many of these labels, and many Australian manufacturers of a wide range of products will have to amend their labels as a result of this legislation&mdash;not all of them because they have been dishonest in the past. Many manufacturers have been abiding by the law as it stands at the present time and have been faithfully recording the origin of their products in accordance with the existing standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will change the standards and will require those Tasmanians who want to record the Tasmanianness of their product to put extra words on their labels. Naturally, that is a matter of some concern. In the past, a lot of effort has been put into promoting labels and changes will now have to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill could have been&mdash;and should be&mdash;a major advance, and it could have provided effective origin labelling in Australia. I am confident that the amendments proposed by the coalition&mdash;if the government has not yet woken up to the fact that they enjoy overwhelming community support&mdash;will receive the endorsement of the Senate and the government will have to confront this issue again. I hope that wise counsel will prevail and that the minister will listen to the consumer organisations, the farmers, the manufacturers and the unions and accept the wisdom of the coalition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers want to buy Australian, and they have a right to know that the products that they buy are indeed Australian. Therefore, country of origin labelling legislation has its genesis in a worthwhile objective. Much of this legislation has a commendable approach but, regrettably, some changes need to be made. I am disappointed that, even after a year of attempts at persuasion, the minister has not accepted the wisdom of the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Busy shoppers do not have time to read page after page of labels; they want to know the information that is important to them, and that information needs to be supplied readily and simply. There is an opportunity in this legislation to give Australia the sort of labelling laws that we need and want. I hope that the minister will see the wisdom of the coalition amendments and accept them before the passage of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you would be aware that in the early 1970s a large number of people from my side of politics&mdash;very few from that side of the House at that time&mdash;were very aware of what was taking place in South Africa, were very aware of what apartheid meant, and were very aware of the disgraceful actions that took place against the black population of South Africa, which was the majority. As part of that, a large number of us determined that, like Gandhi, we would like to make some form of non-violent protest, and that, like Gandhi, we would like to use our lifestyle to change in some way the lifestyle of those unfortunate people living under that fascist regime and that fascist system&mdash;apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We determined&mdash;Mr Speaker, you can correct me if I am wrong, but I seem to remember you being part of that campaign in some small way back in the 1970s&mdash;to use our purchasing power to avoid South African goods. To avoid South African goods at that stage, we identified companies that were producing in South Africa and wherever possible we used origin labelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is origin labelling about? What did it enable me to do that I would not have been able to do without it? What is the purpose of it? The purpose of it is that it enabled me, as a consumer, to make an intelligent choice as to which goods I purchased, depending on their origin. In other words, I was in a position to decide not to let my consumption assist, in any way, the subjugation of black Africans, and many other Australians took that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would like to make refers to studies into free trade and the non-tariff barrier limitations that countries place on goods from other countries. I was quite astounded to find out that the country which uses the most non-tariff barriers is Japan. In fact, Japan uses virtually every non-tariff barrier conceivable to stop goods coming into that country. I found that appalling because Japan is a country which is basically totally dependent on international trade. Japan is a country which relies on the goodwill of other countries to allow its goods to come in to look after, support, house, clothe and educate its own people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst those non-trade barriers were campaigns to buy the domestic country's produce. We have seen the buy Australian campaign in Australia. I think one organisation&mdash;and there are a number of organisations&mdash;AusBuy lists companies with overseas ownership or partial overseas ownership. That then allows individual consumers to make an assessment or a judgment about whether or not they will support that company by purchasing the product. In other words, labelling the country of origin allows people to become involved in the macro-economic environment; they can physically do something in their daily life to alter the economic conditions in their own country vis-a-vis other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In plain language: I can turn around and say, `Look, a lot of my mates are out of work so I will spend every dollar that I have on Australian goods where at all possible&mdash;price and quality being comparable.' Sometimes I might have to pay a bit more but, generally, I will not take a lesser good. Campaigns based on that principle need to be based on honourable labelling. They need to be based on a labelling system that gives some clarity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, there is a mill, formerly owned by APPM, now owned by Australian Paper, and one of its major gripes is these look-alike products. Paper lands in this country from overseas with virtually no tariff, but if the same paper were sent back to Indonesia there would be a 46 per cent tariff. I do not believe that is particularly fair and I would like to do something about it. But to rub salt into the wound, to add insult to injury, you find these products called Ausbrite, with big maps of Australia all over them. How many of us have picked up a packet of matches with a kangaroo or a koala on the front, and seen on the bottom `Made in Indonesia'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, taking the symbols of another country and putting them on your product is fraud; it is trying to make out that they are something they are not. If I tried to make out that I was a gentleman in Australian society, most of my people would know that that was not so. I am a product of the working class, I am as rough as they come and, quite frankly, I am proud of it. I am what most of Australia is: I have a lot of faults, a lot of failings but I do my bloody best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about doing our best. It is about setting standards in labelling that reflect reality&mdash;not where you would like to be, not where you were 50 years ago or where you were in the 1950s when I entered this earth. It is about realising that the free trade versus protectionist arguments of 1900 are quite different in the world of 1995. The trade world is now a completely different animal. GATT showed us that last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of aspects of GATT that I am not really pleased about. The Americans have found out that they cannot make dolphin-safe tuna receive preference over the product of countries which catch tuna and kill dolphins on the way. There is a number of unfortunate aspects of GATT but there is a hell of a lot of good aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, this bill is about saying that you can identify where your products come from and all the rest of it but, like racism and apartheid, it is wrong to turn around and say to someone else in the world, `We cannot survive either.' The Americans&mdash;I see certain people sitting in the chamber&mdash;say one thing and mean something different: `We believe in free trade but we are going to subsidise our dairy produce to South-East Asia and knock out traditional Australian markets. We believe it is these nasty west Europeans causing all the problem with the wheat.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us get our act together. The Americans are lying&mdash;they believe in free trade and they believe in mates. If they believed in looking after their own, then they would. But they do not believe in any of it. They are two-faced; they are liars. But the reality is that the world is changing, and we have to deal with liars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an attempt to turn around and in that new world, that new order we are faced with&mdash;not what we produce but what we are faced with&mdash;and have ended up with, we should put a simplified system of labelling on goods which reflects Australian content, the internal aspects of the Australian economy and its actions on that product. It allows the Australian consumer to look at a product, have confidence and know exactly what relationship that product has had with Australian workers and the Australian environment. It does not dictate to them that they shall buy goods labelled `made in Australia' or `produced in Australia'; it gives them an opportunity to choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reflected previously that during the 1970s&mdash;and I reflect back on this today with some degree of pride&mdash;many of us chose to use our lifestyles and our spending power for the good. I have a great dilemma at the moment for, yet again, I am going to have to change banks. A mob of wankers in New South Wales went and sold my bank; they did not ask me. I am going to change my bank by going back to the Commonwealth, which is just less than half my bank. I resent having to prop up a group of people, the bankers of this country, who I think over the last hundred years can be seen only as thieves and cutthroats. I resent the fact that I do not have a choice. This labelling system allows people to have a choice. It cuts out all other things. It does not make arbitrary decisions. In fact, it takes a realistic and simplistic approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I support the Minister for Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh), in her approach, and that is why I suggest that she has done the best she can in the right way. Basically, this legislation means that Australians will be able to look at goods that come from Australia and be able to identify them. If they choose to look after and help their mates in their employment, to keep people in their jobs, they will be able to do so. They will be able to do so by picking a product up and looking at its labelling. That labelling will send a message to them, a clear message, as to exactly what it means. They will then be able to make their choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quite firmly think that that is quite a reasonable approach to take. I think it is an approach which will allow Australians to make the choices that they can&mdash;for domestic reasons of patriotic pride, for national interest or for political purposes. I think it is a right that, to the best of my ability, if I am so inclined, I should be able to spend the income that comes through my hands to bring about purposes which I think are valid. This legislation, the way that it is put together, enables Australians to do that. I commend the Minister for Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Grayndler, and I ask this House to support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994. Uncharacteristically, I must say, without being unkind to the member for Gilmore, I find myself in agreement with the principal comment he made that this legislation is largely about allowing Australians to make what he called an intelligent choice and what in my speech I want to refer to as an informed choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did think he was a little in error when he indicated that he is no longer able to make a choice in banking because the State Bank of New South Wales is being sold. It would have been fairer to have observed that, had he been a South Australian, as I am, or a Victorian, he would have found his state bank sold because of the mismanagement of governments of his political persuasion, which would be a matter of considerable angst to him. Having worked on a committee with the member for Cunningham prior to his elevation to the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives, I want to reassure the member for Gilmore that, as a result of a review of banks in Australia, the opportunity was given to ensure that once again he will have a choice. If he chooses there is now the capacity within the banking industry and in the legislation that surrounds the banks in Australia for the member for Gilmore to ask the ACTU, if it is sure that there is that much money in banking, to form a bank just for him and his colleagues. I could do the same thing with the National Farmers Federation. So I think that choice still exists in Australia. This is still a country in which we as Australians can easily choose to buy and sell goods in a way we think is appropriate and morally suitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though it is coincidental, it is nonetheless appropriate that this legislation on labelling is the first legislation being considered by this House following Australia Day 1995. This legislation is unashamedly parochial and unashamedly pro-Australian. This legislation says, `Let us focus on ensuring that Australian consumers can go into an Australian retail outlet anywhere and buy the goods they want, knowing that a proportion of goods they are getting comes from Australia and a proportion may be sourced overseas.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is an appropriate illustration of what this legislation is all about which is understood by any Australian who has travelled overseas. This is the end of the summer vacation, the end of a time when a number of Australians and a number of members of federal parliament have been travelling overseas. When people are overseas they frequently find themselves in a bit of a dilemma about just what they should eat and what they should purchase. Overseas travellers invariably know when they buy a bottle of Coke or walk through the golden arches of a McDonald's restaurant what they will get. It may not be precisely what you and I would want and it may not necessarily be our first choice, but the symbols of Coca-Cola, McDonald's and a number of chains mean that we know what we are getting. That symbol is our assurance that in the eyes of those chains we are getting both quality and value. Lost overseas though we may be and uncertain purchasers though we may be when we wander overseas, here we have the labels that tell us what we are going to get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, a recent Coles survey indicated that 89 per cent of Australians would prefer to buy `Made in Australia' product. That 89 per cent was up from 86 per cent two years earlier when the survey was last conducted. Even more astonishingly, in a survey into citrus juice and citrus juice products, not only did more Australians indicate they would prefer to buy Australian product but 73 per cent of Australians said they would be prepared to pay more in order to access what they were guaranteed was Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Gilmore has said, the best non-tariff barrier we have is the capacity for Australians to freely choose Australian products. Now we are in a society very much about lowering tariffs. We are stuck with that under our GATT rules. Though it would have been politically much easier and much more popular for the opposition to oppose the lowering of tariff barriers, we recognise that there are opportunities for Australia in the lowering of tariff barriers, and we have supported the government. We have not had many thanks, I must say, but we have supported the government in that very difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lowering tariff barriers means there are more imported goods coming into Australia and more opportunities for Australian goods to be sold overseas. I know that as one who has been a long-term practitioner in the citrus industry, both exporting and facing imported frozen orange juice concentrate. As we lower those barriers in order to meet our GATT obligations and expose ourselves increasingly to imported product, the important thing that Australia has running in its favour is the opportunity for its informed purchasers and consumers to choose Australian product. There is nothing illegal about that under GATT. There is nothing restrictive about that and it gives Australian producers the edge. So the opposition finds itself inundated by requests from producers overseas for this legislation to be amended&mdash;not that the legislation of itself is wrong, but it could so easily be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, for example, I have been approached by pork producers who are concerned about imported pork. They are concerned initially about what it does to quarantine standards&mdash;that is a matter to be addressed by AQIS, not this legislation&mdash;and they are also concerned that they should be able to ensure that anyone who goes into a butcher shop or supermarket to purchase pork knows that that pork had its origin in Australia and is assured that the leg of ham labelled `Manufactured in Australia' came from a pig that was running around Australia, not that it came from Canada and went into a carton that was manufactured in Australia. So the pork producers have sought changes at the edges of this legislation to ensure that Australian consumers can make informed choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own industry, the fruit juice industry, with frozen concentrated orange juice coming in from Brazil, there is always the constant bind of how much of the carton of fruit juice that I am picking up off the supermarket shelf comes from Brazil and how much comes from Australia and how I, as a consumer, can easily identify which is which. How do you tell? The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Citrus News</EMPHASIS> carried an article expressing its concern about the need for more effective labelling legislation. I will read excerpts of that article into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent survey of orange juice drinkers in Sydney and Melbourne shows that consumers still need help in identifying 100% Australian orange juice over imported reconstituted juice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the research, commissioned by the Australian Horticultural Corporation on behalf of the citrus industry, found that Australians had a strong preference for single strength juice because of its consistency, fresh taste and real orange favour. On the other hand, juice which had been reconstituted from concentrate was sometimes seen as artificial or synthetic tasting, watery, thin or bitter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While 78% of respondents were aware of the difference between daily squeezed orange juice (single strength) and reconstituted juice, there was clearly substantial confusion about what they currently buy and drink. Three quarters claimed to drink single strength juice though many contradicted themselves later in the interviews.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When tested on the brands purchased, many respondents were surprised to learn that their choices were not daily squeezed but based on concentrate, which is mainly imported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, half of the survey respondents were unaware that reconstituted juice may contain imported ingredients. Nine out of ten respondents agreed that labels should state country of origin if they contain imported ingredients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bart Gannon, industry manager of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, said the research proves that the 100% logo can help overcome consumers' confusion about labelling and provide a guaranteed level of quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The logo, which is readily identified by a squeezer symbol, means that the juice contains no concentrate, no artificial colouring, no added water and no imported fruit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gannon said that the challenges facing the fresh juice industry, meant that the 100% logo may become even more important in giving consumers reasons to support the brands on which it is displayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was particularly significant when 73% of people said they would be prepared to pay extra for Australian orange juice.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is: a plea for a logo which tells the consumer precisely what he or she is buying. The legislation currently before the House takes a step towards ensuring that consumers know what proportion of the goods they are getting are made in Australia or manufactured in Australia, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that it would take but a few amendments to sharpen this legislation and make it even more effective. I have little doubt&mdash;and this is a little presumptuous, Mr Deputy Speaker, so I hope you will be tolerant&mdash;that when the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) rises to participate in this debate he will want to refer to the Australian dried fruits industry which he represents. The Australian dried fruits industry has been very bothered about the import of Turkish dried apricots and the difficulty of distinguishing between dried apricots grown in Turkey and packed in Australia or those grown in Australia and packed in Australia because currently both products can merely be termed `Produce of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for consumer affairs, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who is in the chamber, made an impassioned plea for better recognition in the peanut industry of the sorts of peanut products that are sometimes imported from overseas, processed in Australia and then labelled as `Product of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story goes on and on. The emerging Australian wine industry, which has been enjoying such success, is about to face real changes in appellation. The French have said, `We will not allow you to use a French regional wine district on the label of an Australian wine.' We want to be able to assure Australian producers that the same sort of discrimination in favour of Australian product exists in law in Australia as it currently does in France. Whether you are buying foodstuffs, which have been the focus of the debate to date, or suits or shoes or motor cars or any other goods, what consumers seek to know is whether or not they are buying an Australian product so that they can exercise an informed choice in favour of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fairness to the government, with the total support of the opposition, it has already spent $15 million over the last eight years informing Australians about what the pro-Australian logo means. What we do not want to happen is to have the legislation currently before the House erode the standing of Australian made or have ourselves caught in a re-education program. With the amendments proposed to the legislation by the opposition, we are seeking simply to ensure that Australians can make an informed choice and know that `Made in Australia' means one thing and that `Manufactured in Australia' means something quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that when the government working party empowered to look at this legislation handed down its report in May 1993 it suggested there ought to be a limit to the terms describing Australian origin. It suggested terms should be restricted to `Made in Australia', `Produce of Australia' or `Product of Australia'. The working party went on to say that, to qualify for these descriptions, the goods must have acquired their essential character in Australia. We, the opposition, agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we have been approached by a range of people, including the Confectionary Manufacturers of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia, the Victorian Farmers Federation, the Food Policy Alliance, the National Farmers Federation and a whole host of individual industries in each our electorates, the coalition is suggesting that the bill should be amended so that proposed subsection 65VE(2) relating to `Product/ Produce of Australia' and `Made in Australia' form category A, to meet conditions where all the major ingredients or components are Australian and all operations in manufacturing and processing occur in Australia. Therefore, consumers will know simply that `Made in Australia' means just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation has commended the  federal opposition for its move to change the proposed labelling laws to more accurately reflect the origin of a product, including its components and ingredients. The opposition has proposed important amendments to the trade practices bill to clearly clarify descriptions such as `Made in Australia' or `Product of Australia'. The National Farmers Federation has supported this position taken by the opposition. In fact, the President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr McGauchie, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . farmers had argued vigorously for the term "Made in Australia" to be used only to describe goods manufactured in Australia from Australian ingredients.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McGauchie went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's amendments will ensure that "Made in Australia" means exactly what it says.</PARA>
<PARA>This is really what the public want. The public, particularly Australian consumers, want to know that the labelling is accurate and unambiguous and that the information about the country of origin is consistent on all product labels. That was the view of the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and over again reference has been made in this debate to comments by Mr John Corboy, the Chairman of SPC, and I have little doubt that the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) would want to make similar comments, given that SPC is based in his electorate. The canners SPC, with whom I have an affinity because there was a large canning operation in my own electorate run by Berrivale Orchards, has indicated that this will be the last year in which it will be canning in the traditional way. But, relative to this legislation, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">SPC News</EMPHASIS> of 19 October 1994 reported Mr John Corboy as saying:</PARA>

<PARA>What more can I say, Mr Deputy Speaker? We believe all that we are asking for as an opposition is not that the government legislation should be opposed but that it should be brought into sharper focus so that the term `Made in Australia' quite distinctly refers to goods which are made in Australia, to allow every consumer in Australia to make an informed choice in favour of Australian product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak to this, the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994. This bill will establish a new labelling scheme for goods that make claim to be of Australian origin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current state of Australian labelling is woeful. Australian consumers are constantly being asked to buy Australian, but labelling regulations are so farcical that labels with symbols that are distinctly Australian cannot be relied upon. We have heard those opposite say similar things. If it were not so serious, the fact that products packaged with a symbol of an Australian flag or a map are not necessarily Australian, it would be a great joke. I am sure the people who have taken advantage of situations like this are laughing all the way to their foreign bank to quickly deposit their ill-gotten Australian dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will first and foremost give Australian consumers the confidence to know that the product they are buying is genuinely Australian. The only way that this can be done clearly is by definition of terms. That is what this bill does. It takes the terms `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia' and `Made in Australia' and gives them a clear definition. When this bill is passed, these will be the only terms used to identify goods that are Australian. The legislation also means that terms with meanings that are unclear, such as `Manufactured in Australia' or `Processed in Australia', will not be allowed. Even if part of the production process is conducted in Australia, any label on that item can state what that step was but must also identify the origin of its ingredients or components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Truly Australian industries will benefit enormously from this legislation because it makes sure that a product that claims to be Australian is genuinely Australian. Australian consumers will also benefit greatly because for the first time they will be making their purchasing decisions based on information which will be reliable. Australian industry will now finally get full reward for investing in Australia because Australian industry alone will finally be allowed to promote itself as being Australian without fear that rival foreign products can also do the same by misrepresentation on their labelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has now been around for quite a long time and, due to a number of concerns, was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. That committee made its report on 6 June last year. The committee made the decision that the meanings which this bill ascribes to the terms `Product of Australia' and `Made in Australia' are the only logical and practical ways of solving this problem. This bill has also been to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which made the recommendation that it be passed with the amendments that have been proposed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight the fact that this bill has been to committees of both chambers of this parliament for additional consideration to show that the bill we have before us is a good one. It has been scrutinised not only by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) and the government, but also by parliamentary committees, where opposition members are able to have their input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be no reason for anyone to bleat about the contents of this bill. I say this because, unfortunately, the Premier of Tasmania, Ray Groom, has criticised this bill over a number of months. The attacks he has made have been based on the notion that, when this bill is passed, products will be unable to be identified as distinctly Australian. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Mr Groom has engaged in an exercise of cheap political point scoring on this issue, when the facts do not stack up with the rhetoric. The minister has gone out of her way to consult with the Tasmanian government on this issue but, unfortunately, the consultation she has conducted and the information she has provided have fallen on deaf ears. The minister has made at least two trips to Tasmania to directly address the concerns of the Tasmanian government and the misinformed public perception of this bill that the Tasmanian government has created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the minister for her endeavours in this area. It is just another example of the extensive consultation and explanatory process that the minister has adopted in getting the bill to this stage. I will read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter I received from the minister addressing the Tasmanian concerns:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mrs Smith</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past few weeks I have been contacted by a number of industry groups in Tasmania regarding one aspect of the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994. The Tasmanian government also raised concerns about the same issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were concerned that the legislation would prevent them from using the word Tasmania on labels of their various goods. I have subsequently met with industry representatives and with the Tasmanian Minister for Consumer Affairs, the Hon. Dr Madill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have confirmed that not only will they be able to continue to use Tasmania, but by giving consumers more reason to trust the information on labels, the legislation will probably make their promotions even more effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the legislation consumers throughout the country will come to know that the terms product/produce of Australia and made in Australia have very clear meanings. These are the only two authorised terms in the legislation and variations such as made in Tasmania will not be permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it will be possible to add the name of a place after the authorised term: such as product of Australia&mdash;Tasmania or made in Australia at Hobart&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or wherever in this wonderful country you might like to have your product come from. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this is allowed in the bill presented, given the misunderstanding on this point in Tasmania, I will be introducing an amendment to make it crystal clear that this is permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, I will be introducing a further amendment to make it clear that, when an authorised term is used, the label can also identify a particular process which happened in a particular place: for instance: product of Australia&mdash;brewed in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will of course continue to be possible to label goods Tasmanian cheese, proudly Tasmanian or pate from Tasmania. The only condition (subject of course to the origin claim being true) is that as these are implied claims of origin, somewhere on the label the authorised term for which they qualify must also appear. There is no restriction imposed by the legislation on the number or the size of these representations&mdash;a product could be almost entirely covered with the word Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely, Jeannette McHugh.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter sums up very succinctly the Tasmanian situation with reference to this legislation, yet Premier Groom in numerous cases&mdash;the latest being as recently as last week&mdash;has continually misrepresented the situation. I referred to an example of this in my media release of 20 May 1994, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Comments in regard to the federal government's new labelling legislation by the Premier, Mr Groom, made today at the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association 14th annual conference were a blatant distortion of the facts,' said Silvia Smith MHR, Labor, Bass.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comments made by the Premier suggested that new federal labelling legislation would prevent Tasmanian manufacturers identifying Tasmania as the source of their product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Premier has it wrong,' said Mrs Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania can be emblazoned on any label in eight foot high letters if the producer so wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Groom knows this. He has been consulted extensively throughout this process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His statement today was a fabrication designed to score cheap political points against the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It really is a sign of desperation on behalf of the state government when issues have to be invented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government's new labelling legislation will protect Australian industry from bogus claims that products are of Australian origin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmanian products will be aided enormously by this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that was the situation in May last year, and that indeed is the situation today. In fact, my office was contacted last week by a journalist who had been given the impression by Mr Groom that, after the federal legislation was passed, Tasmania could no longer be identified on labels as the place of product origin. The journalist asked one of my staff members whether he had missed the drastic changes in the legislation which Mr Groom was obviously talking about. He seemed somewhat perplexed by Mr Groom's comments when he was told by my office what the actual state of play was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me sum up the Tasmanian situation. Tasmanian products can be wrapped in the word `Tasmania' if producers so desire, but they will also be protected in the national marketplace by the fact that they are Australian. Anyone who tells you anything different does not have the facts at their fingertips. In fact, many Tasmanian products, such as the fine Lactos cheeses, already comply with the provisions of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us deal with the bill specifically. This bill will also remedy situations where consumers are given only part of the picture, and that is one of the big problems we have. That can in itself be grossly misleading. For example, the term `Assembled in Australia' may make an Australian consumer think that this is a distinctly Australian product. To clear up potential problems with such claims, this bill requires that a statement is made in regard to the source of the ingredients or components used in the manufacture of such products. Consumers will be presented with a clear picture of the product that they are buying. An example of such a label would be `Assembled in Australia from Imported Components'. The consumer then instantly knows that it was put together in Australia but that its components were made outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also takes into account the positioning of claims on labels when one states that there is a connection with Australia and one states that there is a connection with somewhere else. The simple rule here is that both these claims must be as close together as possible and must be equally prominent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Happily, this bill also makes special provision for the `Australian Made' logo. The provisions of this bill enhance the good work that the `Australian Made' logo has done for so long. The term `Australian Made', along with its triangular logo, may be used on Australian products in conjunction with one of the authorised terms of this bill: `Product of Australia' or `Made in Australia'. This bill is the final step in the work of the `Australian Made' logo because it now truly ensures that the logo will be used only on goods that really are Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, this is a very good bill. We have finally tackled the age-old problem of identifying Australian goods as genuinely Australian. The problem in the past has been that Australian goods could be called Australian but so could many other goods that were not Australian. This bill addresses that, as we have already heard from speakers here before me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been a long time coming and for a very good reason: it has been through an extensive process of consultation and consideration. I am very sorry to see that in Tasmania it has been an unnecessary political football that has unnecessarily worried and concerned Tasmanian producers and, may I add, consumers. In Tasmania, we have a deserved reputation for the production of fine goods in particular. Those products need to be identified as Tasmanian to capitalise on that image. This bill allows that to happen but it also protects the national identification of those foods as Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I currently have a visitor from the United Kingdom with me in Tasmania. One of the comments he made about Australian products is that it is good to see where in Australia they come from. That comment was made by someone from overseas. He was talking about wine from Western Australia, fruit from South Australia, and cheeses and fine foods from Tasmania. We have a good reputation which we have to keep solid, and that is what this bill does. It also does it for the people within Australia. When I go into a supermarket, I read every label and buy Australian. That is what we really want. We as consumers have to have certainty that, when we buy something that says it is Australian, it really is. We know that that has not been the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to pay particular tribute to the Minister for Consumer Affairs for the tireless process of consultation and explanation that she has conducted throughout this process. It has been a wonderful effort. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) said that the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 is a good bill and she commends it to the House.

I will recount a personal experience that my wife and I had to indicate my commitment to getting labelling right in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we wanted to purchase a new vacuum cleaner. We went to a particular retailer and, before we even looked at any vacuum cleaners on the display floor, we said that we wanted to buy one that was made in Australia. The retailer enthusiastically showed us a vacuum cleaner that was already assembled on the floor. We bought it because it looked to be the one that we wanted. When we got home, the box that contained the vacuum we bought&mdash;not the demonstration model&mdash;had stamped on it `Proudly Australian', so we proudly took the box apart and took the vacuum cleaner out to assemble it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my dismay, I found that the box did not contain the bag that was necessary to make the vacuum cleaner operate properly. I was a bit frustrated and angry about that and went back to the furniture store. By this time the store was closed. On the following Monday, I went down and said, `Hey, you forgot to put the bags in and we are anxious to get the vacuum cleaner going.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retailer went away and then came back and said, `Look, I'm sorry, Lou, we don't have any bags in stock. But we'll contact the warehouse immediately and get them up to you.' That he did. The bags arrived. When I got the package with the bags in them, I saw that they were made in Mexico. So I then made more inquiries about the actual vacuum cleaner. I found that components of the vacuum cleaner had been put together in places in Mexico, as had the bags. The only thing that was truly Australian was the cardboard box, which was stamped `Proudly Australian'. That story indicates where I am coming from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the parliament has a great opportunity to give the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) a good bill. I know that she has worked very hard to try to get a good bill that reflects the ethos that all Australians want; that is, we want to know what we are buying and where it is from. If it is Australian, we want to encourage Australians to buy Australian. That is something about which we are all on the same flight path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why on earth can we not get this bill right? One would have thought that, in expressing the sentiments I have, everyone in the House would enthusiastically support getting the bill right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now say a couple of words about why the bill is not yet quite right. It is nearly right, but not quite. The honourable member for Bass said that the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology supports the bill and, generally, the terms of the bill as being correct. I was, and still am, a member of that committee. I know that the honourable member for Bass has not misled the House&mdash;I am not suggesting that for one moment&mdash;but a reading of the report of the committee, of which I am a member, indicates that its thrust is that, subject to the minister clarifying vital parts of the bill and clearing up concern, the parliament would be able to debate the bill properly and proceed to make its final judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, as a member of the committee, my particular view was that we needed to get the bill into the House after it had been through the process that the minister had gone through and that the minister needed to elaborate on very important parts of the bill and the explanatory memorandum. The House could then make its decision and move amendments to pick up areas that needed to be amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the minister, in response to the committee's view, the views of the coalition and pretty well the whole community, has agreed that the regional labelling ability to not only market products made in Australia as `Product of Australia' but also to highlight the regions from where they come is now proposed by the government to be picked up. That is great. In my case, in Indi, which is about the best part of Australia, we have some very famous value added food producers who are doing great things, including winning export markets and creating jobs and investment for Australia with clean food. We must not forget that Australia is the second cleanest continent in the world; Antarctica is the cleanest. We have a great ability to win new markets overseas with our products and to enhance the marketing of them by highlighting the regions from which they come, because they have characteristics that overseas people are very interested in. Marketeers love them because they can promote the products better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will provide some examples. In Milawa, just out of Wangaratta, we have the famous Brown Brothers wineries. Brown Brothers use Milawa quite a lot in its marketing overseas and within Australia. People visit Milawa from overseas because they know about it and are learning more about its great winegrowing capacity and qualities. Rutherglen is another famous wine producing area of Victoria. It is winning exports as well. It is now combining very clever marketing exercises to market collectively the wineries of Rutherglen. Murray Goulburn, which is one of Australia's biggest dairy value added food processors, is now winning exports in excess of $1,000 million per year in Asia and other markets. As an aside, let us hope that the Americans do not muck that up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have those famous regions of my electorate which are ready to enhance and win more trade for Australia and create more jobs. So the bill, with the amendment that is going to be proposed by the government after taking advice, will be pretty good in that respect. I am very happy about that. But the concern I had before the committee inquired into the bill, as a result of discussions I have had with many people and also because I am trained as a lawyer, still remains. It is with respect to the guts of the bill, if you like; that is, the categories and descriptions that can be used which will be prescribed in this bill if it goes through. Let me try to keep it simple but talk about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minister's bill, she wants to differentiate between `Produce of Australia' or `Product of Australia'&mdash;she says that that means that the things are true-blue Aussie, 100 per cent Aussie; I agree that those terms connote and convey that meaning&mdash;and the term `Made in Australia', which she says means that the things are not true-blue Aussie but only that the goods acquired their essential characteristic or qualities in Australia. In other words, there are imported components in them but they are put together in Australia and a substantial part of the final product is made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has steadfastly argued that the expression `Made in Australia' does not convey to the ordinary citizen of Australia and the consumer that the product, if labelled `Made in Australia', is true-blue Aussie. In good faith, that is what she has tried to do. But in actual fact that is not so. If you walk around any street, or any neighbourhood, in Australia and ask John Citizen or Mary Citizen what they think the term `Made in Australia' means, they will tell you, `That's true-blue Aussie. That means it's 100 per cent Australian and I want to buy it. That's what I want. That's what I support.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surveys have been done by reputable survey organisations in Australia that actually confirm what I am saying. The Quadrant survey, I am told, established that 74 per cent of consumers, when asked, believed that a product labelled `Made in Australia' should not contain imported ingredients. In other words, when it is bought it should not contain imported ingredients. The CSIRO national nutrition survey of January 1994 found that 98 per cent of consumers surveyed agreed that food should not be labelled with the words `Australian Made' unless it was both grown and processed entirely within Australia. The Coles survey of October 1993 established that 89 per cent of those surveyed, an increase of three per cent on the previous year's survey, said that they preferred to buy locally manufactured food products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that basis, and also from a legal point of view, I believe that the minister's attempt to say that the term `Made in Australia' should not be used for true-blue, 100 per cent Australian products is wrong. She partly acknowledges that view because in her second reading speech, and when she gave evidence to the committee, she actually said that her intention was to spend a substantial amount of Australia's taxpayers' money to educate Australians as to the meaning of these terms. In other words, the impression and belief of the vast majority of Australians that the term `Made in Australia' means 100 per cent, true-blue Aussie will be changed by education and marketing exercises that the taxpayer will pay for. That seems to be nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, why spend taxpayers' money when you do not have to, particularly when you understand that some $15 million of it has been spent already over the past eight years by this government to educate the community about the meaning, and the aura, of using the term `Made in Australia'. Obviously the campaign has been fairly successful because, from the surveys I have quoted, it is pretty clear that most Australians believe that the term `Made in Australia' is synonymous with true-blue, 100 per cent Aussie and so think, `I'll buy it; that's what I want.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to my own experience with my wife regarding the vacuum cleaner, if the vacuum cleaner that we bought on that Saturday morning had had the label `Made in Australia' we would have honestly thought that it was Australian, a fair dinkum Aussie product. As it turned out, it was not. The box said `Proudly Australian'. I agree that such words as `Proudly Australian' should not be used to mislead people and that we should try to have terms that are capable of being used consistently in a marketing sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is urging the government to make this bill a good bill&mdash;it is nearly a good bill&mdash;and to look at our amendments seriously and pick them up. We propose to adopt the minister's suggestion that the categories to represent true-blue, 100 per cent Aussie should be `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia', just as she proposes, or `Made in Australia'. The reason is that `Made in Australia' is already accepted by most Australians as indicating that it is 100 per cent Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that there needs to be another category to enable categorisation of a product where a product is actually put together in Australia and achieves its essential characteristic in Australia but has some part that is not from Australia. We propose that the words `Manufactured in Australia' are appropriate in that case because, from our knowledge of what consumers think, if they see the words `Manufactured in Australia' it signals to them that it is not necessarily in all of its ingredients Australian but it is substantially so because it is put together in Australia. That is the issue and the nub of the debate between the coalition and the government that needs to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, if the government accepted our amendments it would be a bill that both sides agree to and that the ACTU, the National Farmers Federation and manufacturers, particularly in the food industry, would enthusiastically support. Most consumers would understand it and, I would suggest, whilst you would still need a bit of an education program you would not have to spend anywhere near the amount of taxpayers' money to bed it down in the community and get it working well. It would stop consumers from complaining in future to tribunals, which costs more money, and would stop business and industry from being more frustrated and encourage them to get on with the job and invest with confidence knowing the ground rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not want to put in place a set of rules for industry and business in Australia that is going to create more problems for them. We all from both sides of the House know how business is saying to government in Australia, `Get off our back. Tell us what you want to do, we'll do it all right but please don't put humbug, bureaucracy, red tape and stupid laws in our way of developing, investing in and creating jobs and winning trade, particularly overseas trade.' You have only to ask the people outside from the timber industry about their desperation and frustration about government's uncertainty, not knowing what the ground rules are and having them changed on them all the time. I do not want to go into that too deeply now, but I am sure that the government members here in the House know what I mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the minister has put in a lot of personal effort to make this bill right. I make a plea to her to heed the advice of many people, including many of her colleagues on that side of the House, who privately have told me that they think the minister should accept these amendments that we are putting forward in good faith. If she did that, I think full credit to her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make is that it is not true that the minister's working party recommended the bill that the minister brought into the House. Quite the contrary, the minister's working party, which consulted with hundreds of industries in Australia, made a recommendation to the minister for a quite different bill from the one that she produced. The preferred option of the working group, which released its report in May 1993, was to limit the terms describing Australian origin to&mdash;guess what&mdash;`Made in Australia', `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia'. That is what they recommended. They said to qualify for these descriptions the goods must have acquired their essential character in Australia. So they then started to argue a different thesis, a different basis for arriving at the law. That is where the minister obviously did not agree with her department's advice and that is where I think the bill started to go a little wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the concern of other good manufacturers in Australia such as food manufacturers in the confectionery and grocery industries. They have been very concerned that they will be disadvantaged in the marketing of their products in Australia if the bill is not right. For example, chocolate manufacturers in Australia make a very good chocolate as we all know&mdash;and to my regret unfortunately I sometimes enjoy it too much. Because all chocolate requires cocoa as an ingredient, and because no cocoa is grown in Australia&mdash;it is imported&mdash;it is impossible for an Australian chocolate to claim to be `true blue 100 per cent Aussie'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are concerned&mdash;and it is a valid concern&mdash;about competing against imported chocolate, for example from Switzerland or France, which has a certain image about it when people buy chocolate for a special friend or as a gift. Those labels&mdash;when you look at them carefully&mdash;of the Swiss or French chocolate say `Product of Switzerland' or `Product of France'. They are being marketed and sold in Australia but do not have `but with cocoa imported from some other place' written on them. Yet Switzerland and France do not have cocoa either; they have to import all their cocoa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a valid reason for manufacturers such as chocolate manufacturers in Australia to say, `Hang on, you are not going to let us claim to be true blue 100 per cent Australian in our labels because we have an imported ingredient, namely cocoa. Therefore, we have to have a diminished label, one that does not quite give us the oomph we want; but our competitors from France and Switzerland can have a product on the shelves in Australia which says, `Product of Switzerland' or `Product of France', without having to say that there is imported cocoa in the product. That is a valid point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think our confectionery industry in Australia is one of the best in the world. It has made tremendous progress in producing products with new technology and winning markets in a very competitive field. We should recognise that and give them more assistance, such as perhaps by modifying the label by providing an exemption where there is this basic problem of getting the component&mdash;the manufacturers have to import cocoa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, under the minister's bill, they will not be able to use these higher denominators of description. They will have to have a qualified label. That is a bit of a pity because most Australians would regard Hoadley's and Mars Bars and all those sorts of chocolate as Australian. We know they are made in Bendigo and Ballarat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am extremely happy to have the chance today to support the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill. I want to begin my remarks today with a few words by a constituent of mine, Mrs Glad Freney of Wavell Heights. Last year Glad was awarded the Syd Einfeld Consumer Award, an award which is handed out each year for a consumer who has worked hardest for the consumer movement in Australia in that past year. At the award ceremony in Brisbane Glad told locals, the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Ms Jeanette McHugh, and the local press, `If I can't find an Australian-made product, I just won't buy it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Glad was really expressing was the sentiment of many Australians, particularly the sentiment of many people who live locally in my electorate of Lilley; the sentiment to support Australian made products. It is a sentiment which I believe is growing in our community. Glad being honoured with the Syd Einfeld award shows the strength of the consumer movement throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Glad has been a tireless worker locally in terms of Price Watch and has been a very important contributor to a number of other local community organisations. In receiving the Syd Einfeld award, she was receiving an award which was named after a former New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs. It was Syd Einfeld who introduced many of the laws relating to date stamping, deceptive packaging and product safety, many of the themes which have been taken up in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat ironic that, on the day the opposition announces its new front bench team, we are dealing with legislation that prohibits the use of any representation which might be misleading or ambiguous. We, of course, now have a new Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), whose use-by date has passed twice&mdash;firstly, as a Treasurer in the Fraser government and, secondly, as a New Right Margaret Thatcher. Now he is a Leader of the Opposition who is trying to mutate before our very eyes, trying to turn himself into some sort of cuddly koala with glasses, some sort of new-age Blinky Bill who has put away his claws and put away his harsh past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Syd Einfeld would say, and indeed Glad Freney might well say, that the sort of image that is being portrayed through the statements made in the media by the opposition is in fact in breach of the false advertising and ambiguous labelling provisions of this bill. That is indeed ironic, because deceptive packaging, deceptive labelling, is something that this bill aims to put an end to. It does it for a very good reason, because the more Australians buy Australian made products, the more that they support Australian made products and do not buy imported products, the more jobs that they create in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has a very important role to play in our continued economic recovery. It has a very important role to play in assisting us to import less, because import replacement is one of the critical challenges that this country faces in solving its balance of payments problems. I believe that this bill is very much in the spirit of the sort of work that is done by consumers like Glad Freney and the sort of work that was done by Syd Einfeld, because discerning consumers who have a commitment to buy quality Australian products also have a commitment to creating more jobs in this country and replacing imports. Every time we replace an import we are pushing more money into the Australian economy and creating jobs for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of enthusiasm that is shown by consumers like Glad Freney is repeated around the country. Hugh Mackay, in his book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reinventing Australia: the mind and mood of Australia in the 90s</EMPHASIS>, talks about the emergence of a back to the basics movement in Australian society. He finds in his research that an increasing number of Australians will, if given the opportunity, buy Australian. That research is backed by many other companies who are active in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, a survey by the Ramis Corporation found that 77 per cent of people surveyed indicated that they bought Australian made goods wherever possible. It should be said that this was not always the case. If you go back a few years you will see that the research figures were much lower. They were down around the 50 per cent mark. Research undertaken on behalf of the Australian Made Foundation has found that something like 95 per cent of Australians believe that buying Australian made products helps the economy, that 93 per cent of Australians believe that Australian made products help create jobs and that there is a very high consumer awareness of the Australian made symbol in excess of 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research by the Ramis Corporation in 1993 found that 80 per cent of Australians have a preference for locally made goods. This research also found that there is an increasing consumer confidence in Australian made goods, particularly in their quality. This is in contrast to work done in 1986 which found the Australian consumer to be critical of Australian made products. There is no doubt that the key to the success of buying Australian lies in lifting the quality of Australian made products, something that has been done with great success over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 3 February last year found that Australianness does sell, and an increasing number of businesses are tapping into this. Research commissioned by the Coles supermarket chain has found that something like 67 per cent of people believe that Australian made food products are of better quality than those made overseas and that 59 per cent of people say they would buy Australian made products even if the local product is 10 per cent more expensive than the comparable imported item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very important. If we can encourage more Australian consumers to buy more Australian products and to reject the imported products, we can create more jobs in this country and make a very important impact upon our balance of payments. A study by Professor Jensen of the Department of Economics at the University of Queensland has estimated that with respect to the year 1991-92 each million dollars of new or retained manufacturing activity in Australia could be expected to produce approximately 29 1/2 years of employment, an additional $280,000 in taxes and charges to all levels of government and something like a $230,000 reduction in welfare savings to government. So there are very considerable benefits to the Australian economy by buying Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the relevance of this bill to those economic facts of life? It is very simple. To date there is a degree of ambiguity about the extent to which the existing labelling legislation is effective. This legislation is about clearing up those problems so that Australian consumers can be absolutely confident that when they are buying a product they will have a very clear idea as to whether it is completely manufactured, designed and produced in this country; whether it is partially manufactured, designed or produced in this country; or whether it has none of those features at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very important distinction between `Product of Australia' and `Made in Australia' because these days, with the internationalisation of the economy, there will be many products which will be made in this country but which will contain some imported component. I give but one example in my electorate: the Voxon mobile phone. It is engineered, designed and partially manufactured in Australia, but it has some imported componentry which is not yet manufactured in this country. That is why we need a distinction between `Made in Australia', where the product may have some imported components but is still essentially designed and made here, and `Produce of Australia', where the product is totally designed and made from Australian products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the criticisms of those opposite are invalid. If we were to go down the road suggested by them, we would be declaring a large number of Australian manufactured products not to be made in Australia. That would be to the disadvantage of many working Australians, particularly in sectors of our manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole question of import replacement and `Made in Australia' was very much at the heart of the government's white paper Working Nation. I am chairman of the caucus employment task force. We travelled around the country and received submissions from Australians telling us how we could get high levels of sustainable employment growth and how we could do something to eliminate long-term unemployment. Constantly people were coming to us and saying that we need to be doing something about import replacement, that we need to be doing it at the level of our industry policy and that we need to be convincing Australians to have much greater loyalty in buying Australian made products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there is a community understanding, demonstrated by all the research, that buying Australian makes real economic sense. Consumers understand that, in a very real way, by buying Australian they are making a real commitment to jobs in Australia. That is why I believe this is a very important bill. That is why the desire of all Australians, particularly Australians such as Glad Freney, to buy Australian must be backed up by a logical, coherent, simple labelling regime, which is what this bill provides for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far in the debate we have heard many examples of where the current regime falls down, where descriptions are confusing&mdash;to put the best gloss on it&mdash;or downright deceptive. Those descriptions need to be eliminated and the new rules need to be enforced and effectively policed by the Trade Practices Commission. A number of mechanisms in this bill and in the Trade Practices Act will ensure that that is the case. There is a real concern in the community that foreign companies, particularly, are misleading consumers by using ambiguous labels and logos&mdash;for example, using kangaroos to lead buyers to believe that they are purchasing an Australian product. Genuine Australian industry is disadvantaged by that sort of behaviour, which is, in the end, denying jobs to Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are considerable benefits in promoting this legislation for Australian industry. Industry will benefit directly from the removal of such misleading labels in the marketplace. This bill will therefore allow Australians to identify and purchase Australian products much more easily and accurately. In the short term some outlay will be required by manufacturers and certainly a commitment by the government will be required to effectively advertise the new categories throughout the community. I believe the government has that commitment because in the long term the new labelling system must be of considerable benefit, not just to the economy as a whole but also to manufacturers and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was talking earlier about the `Made in Australia' logo, I referred to a local firm, Voxon, which uses some imported componentry to make mobile phones which it then exports to a number of countries in South-East Asia. The ambiguity which exists under current legislation will effectively be removed by this new labelling legislation, and firms such as those will be able to proudly market their products `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Locally, I have another very significant manufacturing facility called Golden Circle. It is the biggest cannery in the Southern Hemisphere. Pineapples make up a significant proportion of its total production. All of the pineapples which are canned and sliced by Golden Circle are grown in Queensland. The cans the pineapple goes into are made at the cannery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Produce of Australia', the other categorisation we are putting forward, is designed for the sort of operation that we have at Golden Circle. Golden Circle will be producing Australian product from Australian rural produce, from Australian metal with Australian packaging. So Golden Circle can proudly and unambiguously label that product `Produce of Australia'. If it wants to add the slogan `Proudly Canned in Queensland' or whatever, it can do that too. Once again we have the mechanism to accurately define the nature of the product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Golden Circle is a very important firm employing something like 1,400 people in my electorate of Lilley. It has put a lot of money into promoting how Australian its product is, and this new labelling legislation is tailor-made for this sort of product because it is the sort of product that can and does compete on quality and price with much of the imported product. If this legislation is effectively promoted, it will work for the benefit of people who work at Golden Circle as well as the shareholders in Golden Circle. In the long run it will result in more people working at Golden Circle and in more cans of tinned pineapple being sold in competition with the imported product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1980s, through its research Golden Circle found that only four per cent of Australians were overly concerned about buying Australian, but last year Golden Circle found that a very significant number of people felt that buying Australian was now important. The change that Hugh Mackay was talking about before in the Australian attitude towards buying Australian is coming through locally with firms such as Golden Circle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this bill and the amendments contained therein will allow firms such as Golden Circle not only to market its product as `Produce of Australia' and claim it to be unambiguously Australian but also to have the capacity under this bill to put additional labelling on it such as `Proudly made in Queensland' or, in the case of a Tasmanian product, `Proudly produced in Tasmania'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the labelling categories have to be backed up with a regime of fines when people are in breach of the labelling requirements, and sections of the Trade Practices Act will work to do that. The act will also prohibit the use of any representation which could be seen to be misleading or ambiguous. This act will require that products clearly state what the Australian content is in a regulated fashion. I believe that was also addressed by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a label claims that goods are made in Australia, consumers can be confident that goods acquired their essential character in Australia. But if they are to contain a high proportion of imported goods, the label will have to contain the country of origin for those goods. The use of potentially misleading pictorial and symbolic representations of Australia will be controlled so that any pictures must be consistent with the printed information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all very important steps towards giving this legislation the integrity for which Australian consumers are looking because Australian consumers need a uniform, easy to understand system. If the sorts of suggestions put by those opposite were put into practice we would lose that simplicity. Australians want to know whether a product is completely Australian or whether the ingredients and production are largely Australian&mdash;and the categories that we have given adequately do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, these labelling regulations will be successful only if we have a very significant, direct education campaign not only for consumers but also for industry. That will require a significant degree of government advertising and significant promotion by industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important piece of legislation. The new labelling regulations will encourage the process of import replacement which is absolutely vital to Australia's sustainable economic growth. The introduction of this bill is timely because it complements perfectly the government's purchasing policy first outlined in the white paper last year and is the product of much of the work done by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) who has just joined us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to effectively engage in import replacement, Australian governments must play an important role. If we are to encourage the community to buy Australian, then their representatives in their state and national parliaments must have the same commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy decisions brought down in Working Nation achieve that aim and give the lead to Australian industry and to Australian consumers to say that we should always be buying Australian if the price and quality are competitive. We know that Australian industry has in the past four or five years become 30 per cent more competitive. That has meant that we are and can be more effective in the business of import replacement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Origin labelling of consumer goods is a significant practical issue for industry and for consumers. As tariff barriers have fallen, local producers have been forced to compete with products from overseas countries. The relatively high cost of Australian labour means that imported consumer goods can often be sold at a much lower price than that offered by Australian competitors. As a result, increased imports can lead to local job losses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian producers have sought to overcome hostility to imported goods by emphasising to consumers that buying Australian will preserve jobs. In appealing to a growing consumer sentiment to buy Australian, it becomes very important for the manufacturer, supplier and consumer to be able to identify accurately the Australian nature of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When is a product Australian and when is it not?  A product may comprise either Australian or overseas ingredients, or both, and may be manufactured or assembled either in Australia or overseas, or partly in one and partly in the other. The company manufacturing or growing the goods may make or grow them in Australia, but be wholly foreign owned. In these cases, how does one identify or classify the Australian nature of the goods?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a clear, practical, efficient and inexpensive system is not developed there is the potential for manufacturers and suppliers to lose the marketing advantage attached to the notion of Australianness. More importantly, there is a danger that manufacturers and producers will, through their labelling, mislead consumers about the country of origin of all or part of a particular product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) claims that the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 does three things. Firstly, she says that it sets up a scheme that is practical, easy to apply and cost effective for producers to implement. Secondly, she says that it encourages Australian industry to label as Australian products for sale in Australia that are wholly or largely made or produced in Australia. Thirdly, she says that it gives consumers a clear and reliable means of identifying Australian products so that, if they wish, consumers can buy them in preference to imported or mainly imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was first introduced I had concerns with specific aspects of the bill. I was not convinced that it did what the minister claims for it. As a result of those concerns, in my former capacity as shadow minister representing the then shadow minister for consumer affairs, I encouraged the minister to refer the bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for further consideration. I am pleased that the minister agreed. The bill was sent to the committee in May last year. After receiving submissions and conducting hearings the committee released a report in June in which it made some recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has sought to address some, but not all, of the committee's recommendations with amendments to the bill which the government proposes to move. Before the bill was considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, it was also referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. After a public inquiry that committee reported in September last year. Some of my comments will reflect concerns and recommendations of not only the House of Representatives committee but of the Senate committee as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, however, I wish to deal briefly with some background to the bill. Laws dealing with the labelling of goods have evolved in an ad hoc manner at both the state and federal level. Labelling laws are not restricted to matters of origin and may include issues such as additives, health, nutritional standards and even irradiation. The Commonwealth has the power to legislate in relation to imports and exports. As long ago as 1905 the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act was added to the Commonwealth legislative load and contains provisions for the import of goods which have misleading or false labels as to the country or place in or at which the goods were made or produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Food Authority under the National Food Authority Act 1991 regulates origin labelling of food at the federal level. The Australian food standards code contains provisions covering the country of origin labelling of all packaged foods and some other foods. The states and territories have adopted the code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of uniformity of Australian labelling laws was criticised in a report in 1977 by the Trade Practices Commission on packaging and labelling laws in Australia. In its report the commission stated that the state by state approach was the height of folly in any system of rational economic planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The misleading and deceptive conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and its complementary state equivalents&mdash;generally in fair trading acts&mdash;are a major influence on labelling laws in Australia. Subsection 53(eb) of the act specifically prohibits false and misleading representations concerning the place of origin of goods. That provision is one labelling provision that is mirrored in the legislation of all the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Descriptions have been the subject of litigation under that act. The provisions in question include the expression, `Made in Australia', `Produce of Australia' and `Packaged in Australia'. It is clear from the reported decisions of the federal court that what the consumer understands the phrase `Made in Australia' to mean will vary from case to case, depending on the individual fact situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, the cases indicate that the description `Made in Australia' can mean that the ingredients may have been imported but that the product has been subjected to substantial processing in Australia. One interpretation of the phrase `made in', in connection with goods, has been that goods are made in the place in which they are given their essential quality and character. That is not an easy test to apply. It is this interpretation that the present bill adopts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to all of this legislative background, particular industries have adopted voluntary codes or voluntary schemes. There is the Advance Australia Foundation, which</PARA>
<PARA>is licensed by the Commonwealth in turn to license the use of the distinctive green and gold `Australian Made' logo. Even from this very brief survey it can be seen that the present regime is messy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, product labelling, as it pertains to origin, has undergone two recent reviews. In 1992, at the request of the current minister, the federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs prepared a discussion paper on the origin labelling question. The request was prompted by the concerns of consumers and suppliers that current laws were not effective in requiring the identification of the country of origin of goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the release of the discussion paper, the government, in October 1992, established an amalgamated working group to conduct a study into the legislative and other developments that needed to be brought in so that country of origin labelling would be more comprehensive, accurate and informative. The working group comprised representatives of no less than 11 Commonwealth government departments and agencies. It released a report in May 1993. In that report, the working party concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . current Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation imposes potentially conflicting and confusing requirements for the labelling of goods with country of origin information. This situation has led to criticism from suppliers who are unable to determine what is required of them, and from consumers who are unsure of what the claims about origin mean.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill adopts some, but not all, of the recommendations contained in the working party report. The bill is an attempt to rationalise origin labelling in Australia and implement a more uniform regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill applies to consumer goods supplied in Australia. It does not apply to goods intended for export, nor does it attempt directly to regulate product labelling for the purpose of importation. But if the supplier or manufacturer chooses to represent the imported product as having Australian characteristics, the provisions of the bill will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the effect of the bill and the effect of some of the recommendations of the House Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs concerning the bill. The bill provides for the application of a limited number of descriptive phrases to indicate the Australian nature of a product. In the first category, a product may be described as `Produce of Australia' or `Product of Australia'. This description is meant to designate products with the highest level of Australian characteristics. Before either description may lawfully be used under the bill Australia must be the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods, and all the operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods must happen in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second category is the phrase `Made in Australia'. The condition that must be satisfied before this term may lawfully be used, according to the bill, is that the goods must have acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. As I mentioned earlier, this takes up the test applied by the Federal Court in an interpretation of section 53(eb) of the Trade Practices Act. There are several significant difficulties with this descriptive phrase which I will mention shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the third category, the bill allows manufacturers and suppliers to represent that a production step occurred in Australia&mdash;for example, that the goods were assembled, packaged, sewn, carved or built in Australia. However, if such a representation is made, there must also be a representation that identifies the place or places of origin of the components or ingredients of the good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the fourth category are descriptions of goods that carry a representation that a pre-production step occurred in Australia. The most common representation of this kind would be that the goods were designed in Australia. Such a representation can be made only if one of three conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that the goods would in any event fall within the first or second categories&mdash;in other words, the description would also state that the goods were a product or produce of Australia or were made in Australia. The second is that there is also representation that one of the production steps occurred in Australia. That would incorporate the category three requirement that the country of origin and the components or ingredients are included. The third alternative condition that can apply is that there is also a representation that the origin of the goods is outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in the fifth category are goods that carry words, pictures or symbols that are likely to be regarded as Australian origin representation. Examples are koalas, kangaroos, the Australian flag or the words `100 per cent Australian'. The bill permits these representations to be used only if any of the other categories of representation are made or if a representation is made that indicates that the place of origin of the goods is outside Australia. That would be satisfied in the paradoxical situation where a product is labelled under the provisions of this bill `100 per cent Australian. Manufactured in Japan'. Being lawful under the bill, that would presumably then not fall foul of section 53(eb) of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major claims made by the government for this bill is that the scheme it creates will prevent consumers being confused. The House committee in its inquiry into the bill stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the essential purpose of labelling laws is to ensure that information which is conveyed to the public is accurate.</PARA>
<PARA>The example I have just given gives rise both to confusion and to inaccuracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions of the bill where a supplier is licensed to use the `Australian Made' logo and chooses to use that logo, it must also use one of the prescribed representations of Australianness on its product. This means that consumers will have to get used to seeing the `Australian Made' symbol as well as the words `Product of Australia' on some goods whereas other goods will only be able to bear the words `Made in Australia' next to the `Australian Made' logo. It is to be hoped that this, too, will not be confusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one additional proviso in the bill. Where one product contains both an Australian connection representation and a foreign origin representation, the representations must be as prominent as each other and as close to each other as possible. In the explanatory memorandum tabled with this bill we are told this does not mean that the representations have to be in the same size typeface. The terms `prominent' and `close' have not been defined in the bill. These terms will inevitably be the subject of interpretation by the Federal Court. Small enterprises are suffering enough under the regulatory constraints of Labor governments, both state and federal. In leaving such definitions to the courts, this government makes it increasingly complicated and expensive for Australian companies to do business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the main difficulty with the bill is that in the minds of some Australian consumers the term `Made in Australia' designates a purely Australian product made of purely Australian grown or manufactured components or ingredients. But as that phrase is defined in the bill, `Made in Australia' is a standard which is uncertain and difficult to apply, from the point of view of the manufacturer or supplier and from the point of view of the consumer. It will not be easy for a supplier or manufacturer to apply the essential quality and character test to determine whether it may lawfully label its product `Made in Australia'. The bill contains no definition of the meaning of important terms such as `major ingredient or component' and `essential character' or `qualities'. In many cases other than those that just fall short of the stringent product or produce of Australia category the supplier will have to get a legal opinion before it can be sure that its product passes the test set down in the bill. That hardly leads to an efficient, simple and inexpensive scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The note to the proposed section of the bill in which the essential character test is set out gives some examples of circumstances in which the goods acquire their essential character or qualities. The examples are broad formulations and are of limited practical benefit to a person trying to decide how to label a product. The government has said that it will also develop guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members of this House are being asked in this debate to consider a bill with wide practical implications for Australian business. Because of the way the bill is drafted and the lack of important definitions, the application of the labelling scheme proposed by the bill will depend to a large extent on guidelines as yet unseen. Honourable members cannot properly discharge their duty to give proper consideration to a piece of proposed legislation under these conditions. Either the bill should be appropriately amended or the minister should consider preparing the guidelines now for the House to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her second reading speech, the minister said that it would be a waste of time and effort to consult industry in order to draft guidelines before the legislation is enacted. I suggest to the minister that, if she were to go through this exercise, she may then ascertain that the bill in its present form is impractical. She may then understand the concerns that have been expressed very strongly by manufacturers about this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another major concern relates to the use of regional or state identification marks on products&mdash;for example, `Produce of Tasmania' for dairy products of that state, or `Swan Valley Wine' from an area of Western Australia. In its report on the bill, the House committee expressed the view that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . producers should be able to use a state or regional reference on their label if they believe that this will give them a marketing advantage over other products.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate committee endorsed that view. The government has circulated the amendments it proposes to move in respect of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of one of the amendments is to allow a regional identification representation on a product as long as it is preceded by either `Made in Australia' or `Product/ Produce of Australia'. Since a main purpose of this bill is to reduce confusion in the mind of the consumer, it is hard to understand why the regional identifier cannot stand alone. As I have said, the bill is stated to apply only to goods for sale within Australia. I think it is unnecessary to compel a producer to tell Australians that the cheese it is selling as `Product of Tasmania' or `Tasmanian Brie' is also a product of Australia. The government's approach is far too inflexible to the needs and interests of the supplier and fails to recognise the intelligence of the buying public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seasonal variations in supply of raw materials mean that Australian food producers&mdash;for example, baked bean canners&mdash;may rely upon imports for a small time each year to ensure that they maintain their level of production and meet demand. Under this bill, at certain times of the year a producer may be able legitimately to label its product as `Produce of Australia' but at other times be restricted to the `Made in Australia from Australian and imported produce' label. This highlights the difficulties and expense caused to producers by these labelling requirements. The cost of changing labels and changing back will impose a huge burden on food manufacturers who find themselves in this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, unfortunately, fails to achieve its three aims. First, the scheme it proposes is impractical, difficult to apply and costly to implement. Secondly, the difficulties for producers and suppliers mean that they will be discouraged from labelling goods as having Australian characteristics. Thirdly, consumers will be much more confused when they try to identify Australian products to buy in preference to imported or largely imported goods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have looked forward to the opportunity to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill for some time because there are  inequities and ambiguities in the current origin labelling scheme. This has obviously been of concern to people in my electorate and to people right throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk about a lot of things in this House from time to time that we think are of great note to the people of Australia&mdash;let us hope that they are relevant&mdash;but when I talk to people in my electorate sometimes issues such as this are foremost in their minds. When we talk sometimes about the balance of payments and fiscal deficits, we are talking about things that are obviously of great importance. The topic of this bill is of great relevance to average people in Australia. They want to buy Australian products. They do not always go into the supermarket and look for the cheapest goods. They want to know different things about products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, and I am sure it is the same in every electorate in Australia, consumers want to make decisions about whether a product is recyclable, whether it is biodegradable, and whether it contains CFCs. Of course, they want to know whether a product is made in Australia. People in my electorate really emphasise that when they talk to me. They also want to know whether a product is made locally&mdash;whether it is made in Far North Queensland. For example, most shoppers in Cairns buy Malanda Milk dairy products, including Malanda butter and its fine range of cheeses, rather than products from southern competitors. We buy Tableland peanuts; Daintree tea, which is always sweetened with Australian sugar grown and produced in my electorate; local bananas; vegetables; and tropical fruit. We in the Far North are parochial&mdash;we do not apologise for that. We are smart consumers who want to support local industries, because that means local jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of a campaign that ran a couple of years ago in my electorate. The slogan for that campaign was `Buy your kids a job, holiday in Australia'. That campaign was very effective. We want people to holiday in Cairns and Far North Queensland rather than go overseas. Australian consumers like this. That is why this legislation is currently before the House. We want simple legislation that people understand and can relate to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, up to this point, Australian labelling has caused difficulty and confusion for both industry and consumers. As I said before, I have received a lot of feedback and mail on this issue. At a time when consumers are being encouraged to buy Australian goods, they simply have not had the confidence that labels stating or implying Australian origin can be relied on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of debate on this issue in the last 12 months. You would think that manufacturers would understand this issue. Despite that, a couple of pages in the last annual report of the Trade Practices Commission refer to the prosecutions undertaken by the commission. This is on the public record:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22 April 1994 the Federal Court in Melbourne fined Pacific Dunlop a total of $35 000 for mislabelling socks.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the commission accepted undertakings in a case in relation to a place of origin of Aquarius, a Cairns sports drink. So according to the latest report of the Trade Practices Commission, companies are breaching the existing law; obviously we therefore need some sort of clarification and codification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up to now consumers have had good reason to be suspicious of this situation. I have an example of a blatant breach of labelling laws that greatly reduced the marketing of the only pepper grown in Australia. This situation caused outrage in Far North Queensland when it was exposed a few years ago. A sugarcane farmer near Innisfail, just out of my electorate, has been successfully growing and marketing pepper. The tropical climate is perfect for spices but, because of economies of scale, that farmer is not in a position to compete price-wise with imported pepper from Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big pepper marketers in Australia is Saxa. No wonder consumers are suspicious of labelling laws when a company like Saxa is caught red-handed labelling its pepper as `Saxa ground pepper, Pepper Cerebos (Australia) Pty Ltd, 92-96 Station Road, Seven Hills, N.S.W. 2147, Product of Australia, 50g net' but all the pepper contained in that product is imported from Indonesia. Unfortunately it is not just small companies&mdash;companies that might be seen as disreputable&mdash;that are breaching these laws, it is major corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that case, the labelling was clearly a breach of section 53(eb) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and section 4 of the Food Standards Code, which is enforced by the states. The Trade Practices Commission investigated the matter and the company agreed to label its product correctly. This is just the sort of misleading labelling that has caused consumers to mistrust the whole labelling system, and it happened in this case because the laws were being blatantly ignored. I am confident now that, with clearer definitions, consumers will be in a better position to notify the Trade Practices Commission or its successor of alleged breaches of the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 establishes a new labelling scheme for goods that claim to be Australian. The bill will give my constituents a reliable labelling scheme that will help them to identify Australian products and will help Australian industry to promote Australian products and create Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill takes two terms&mdash;`Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia' and `Made in Australia'&mdash;and defines them. These are the only authorised terms. It is very important that we use them in the future to identify Australian goods. Alternate terms with uncertain meanings, such as `Processed in Australia' or `Manufactured in Australia', will not be permitted. If a good does not meet the requirements to be labelled with either of these two authorised terms but some processing took place in Australia, a label which identifies the particular production step which occurred here can be used but it must also state the source of the ingredients or components. Australian industry will benefit from having informed consumers making purchasing choices based on reliable information. It will also benefit from having standard origin terms which will enable it to promote the Australianness of its product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have heard, the bill covers the supply of goods to consumers in Australia. It does not contain a list of goods which must be labelled. Rather, the rules in the bill apply when a supplier, manufacturer or importer chooses to make some claim about the Australian content of his or her goods, or is obliged to do so by some other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important aspect of the bill is that it gives consumers and industry clear terms to identify Australian goods. The terms `Product of Australia' and `Produce of Australia' mean the same thing and are interchangeable. They mean that each major component or ingredient came from Australia and that any processing which took place happened in Australia. An obvious example from my electorate is Malanda dairy products, which are manufactured on the Atherton Tableland from cows' milk produced on the tableland. This is the label for all Australian goods. It meets the consumers' wish to know when the goods are made in Australia from Australian components or ingredients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The label `Made in Australia' means what it says&mdash;that the goods were made here. It recognises that for many products we have to import some or all of the components but that Australian industry and Australian workers transfer those components into a new product. The test for this label in the bill is that the goods must have acquired their essential character or quality in Australia. For example, in Cairns&mdash;which is in my electorate&mdash;is the booming shipbuilding company NQEA. It no doubt has to use some imported components in the construction of sea craft. However, there is no doubt that Australian workers transform those components into a new product. I suggest that there is no doubt at all that the ships built by workers at NQEA are made in Australia. This test reflects the current meaning of `Made in Australia' as established by the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to emphasise that the legislation before the parliament has come with the best legal advice in terms of the previous decisions that have emanated from the Federal Court and the Trade Practices Commission. It is the meaning understood and accepted by industry. Contrary to what was said by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), by retaining this meaning the bill reduces the impact and cost on industry. It is important to note that the terms I have referred to are the only terms authorised by the bill. What the coalition proposes will add to the complexity of the legislation and will add to the confusion amongst consumers. The message for consumers is clear and simple: if the label says `Produce of Australia', it is all Australian. If it says `Made in Australia', it is made here by Australian workers. It is not merely assembled but is made into what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that the most important thing is to get the legislation as simple and as easy to understand as possible, and then undertake an extensive education campaign with the public. It is important to get Australian consumers educated in relation to this legislation so that when people go into a supermarket or an electrical goods store they can choose whether to buy the Australian product or cheaper goods from overseas. As I said before, most Australians want to buy Australian manufactured goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some concern by members of lobby groups about the labelling of food. They have proposed amendments to the bill to make `Made in Australia' mean `all Australian'. It is important to remember that this bill is not just about food. It covers all consumer goods and must be appropriate for all goods. You cannot have a special food labelling bill, a bill for whitegoods and a bill for other manufactured goods. Their proposal would mean that all goods which are currently lawfully labelled `Made in Australia' would have to be relabelled to something like `Manufactured in Australia from Australian Imported Components'. I do not think we want that sort of mouthful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend the honourable member for Greenway says that it is not needed at all. Australian consumers want simplicity. What the coalition proposes would be costly not only for consumers but also for industry. It would penalise the Australian industry both in the local market and in the export market and would result in the export of jobs. Sensibly, the government has rejected such proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's other three labelling requirements remedy situations where consumers are given partial and currently potentially misleading information. For example, a label might identify a particular production step which occurred in Australia like `Assembled in Australia' or `Finished and Packed in Sydney'. In these cases, the bill requires that a statement be made about the source of the ingredients or components for the goods. So labels in future will read `Assembled in Australia from Imported Components' or `Finished and Packed in Sydney from Imported Australian Materials'. Where a supplier says that goods were designed in Australia, then the place of origin of the goods must be identified either by saying that they are made in Australia by identifying particular production steps which happened in Australia or by saying that the goods were made outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new scheme also clarifies the situation as to when the Australian-made logo of the green and gold kangaroo in a triangle can be used. The logo has been a successful marketing tool for government, industry and the Advance Australia Foundation, which administers the logo on behalf of the Commonwealth. It has been successful because it is has been a valuable aid to consumers who want to buy Australian goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the term `Australian made' may be used in conjunction with the logo and requires that the logo must be accompanied by one or other of the authorised terms: product or produce of Australia, or `Made in Australia'. The bill thus ensures that the logo will be used only on goods which are really Australian and that it will continue to be an authentication of the claims made on the goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the passage of this bill despite the efforts of the opposition to hold it up with unworkable amendments and hairsplitting definitions. There has been a lot of obfuscation by the coalition on this legislation. I wonder what the coalition is about. Australian people want simple legislation on origin labelling, not the sorts of complexities that the coalition has put up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the bill that I would like to comment on concerns the issue of regional identification of goods. As I said earlier, we are a parochial lot in Far North Queensland and many local producers are keen to identify the regional origin of goods. In its present form, the bill prohibits the use of terms such as `Product of Queensland' or `Made in Cairns'. However, the bill provides companies with plenty of other opportunities to promote their goods on a regional basis while still meeting the requirements of the bill. One way of doing so is to add the name of the place to the authorised terms. For example, `Product of Australia&mdash;Queensland' or `Made in Australia at Cairns'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about interest rates now. The question was about interest rates now. The fact is, as the Leader of the Opposition knows because he has been in this chair&mdash;he is using his position now to try to make political points but he knows this as a former Treasurer&mdash;that it is absurd to suggest that monetary policy can be left absolutely at the level it reached at the bottom of the cycle and that one should never adjust it upwards. He knows that is an absolute absurdity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, although there has been some increase in interest rates, they are still well below the rates which applied at various times in the past, including much of the time when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country. We do not intend to pursue a policy of relying solely on interest rates. In fact, the government moved first on fiscal policy. It made that decision in 1993 to tighten fiscal policy, and that fiscal consolidation program was quite adventurous by the standards of most western countries and was to give us a budget outcome towards surplus in 1997-98. That represented a considerable consolidation of the budget outcome and involved a lot of discretionary programs to reduce the budget deficit which the opposition opposed, thereby implicitly saying to us that we should be tightening, not by using fiscal policy but by putting more reliance on monetary policy. That seems to be the opposition's position. It tries to have it every which way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of life is that one has to, as a responsible government, use the various levers for economic management which are available to one. That involves responsible use of fiscal policy and of monetary policy. This government has moved on both. It has moved in a quite appropriate way on interest rates, and the measures that have been taken to this stage are already showing some signs of slowing the economy. I will have something to say about that slowing of the economy later today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of monetary policy is a sensible thing for the government to do and it would be an absurdity in the extreme to suggest that one could rely solely on fiscal policy. Even Access Economics, an organisation which the opposition likes to rely on for a lot of its research work and for various comments which it finds favour from, said recently that claims by the opposition that one could leave interest rates alone and rely solely on cutting government expenditure were simply playing politics.

Gross domestic product was forecast at budget time to grow by 4 1/2 per cent. The forecast has now increased to 5 1/2 per cent with growth in non-farm output much more than offsetting a large deterioration in farm production because of the intensification of the drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For business investment, we forecast, as I am sure everyone in the House will recall, an increase of 14 1/2 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For employment, we forecast an increase of three per cent. That forecast has now been adjusted upwards to 3 3/4 per cent. That means the creation of 300,000 additional jobs in the course of the year 1994-95, and means that since the election, as the House knows, we have had an increase in employment of some 477,000 jobs. Our election commitment was to reach a target of 500,000 additional jobs over the course of this period in office. Quite obviously, we will achieve that within the next couple of months&mdash;about a year before the target date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to unemployment, we forecast in the budget an unemployment rate of 9 1/2 per cent in the last quarter of the year&mdash;the June quarter. We now expect that to be 8 1/2 per cent. The unemployment rate will, therefore, be significantly down on the budget forecast. In relation to inflation, the forecast for the underlying rate was two per cent. We now expect that to be up slightly to 2 1/4 per cent, with the so-called headline rate&mdash;the consumer price index&mdash;which was forecast at 2 1/4 per cent, to be 3 1/4 per cent. That increase reflects the impact on the CPI of the mortgage interest rate increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the current account deficit, we forecast that to be substantially higher than it was at budget time; the major reason being the dramatic increase in business investment, which is a very import intensive area of expenditure and will certainly act to considerably boost the current account deficit. Added to that are the impact of the drought on rural exports, which is expected to be notable in the next six months, and rising world interest rates, having their effect on our net interest payments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason the shadow Treasurer thinks he can make such a statement is because of the current account deficit. There have been various times over the past decade and a half when we have come up to those sorts of levels. Obviously they are uncomfortable levels that need to be addressed, and I have announced that we will address them. But I remind the House that in 1980-81 the current account deficit, when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, was 5 1/2 per cent of GDP. That is what it was then. So let us not suggest that an outcome of the dimensions that we are talking about now is something unique to this government: it has been a problem which has been developing over a long period of time, and it clearly developed at the time of the Fraser government. A full statement about how we are dealing with that is something which takes a bit more time than an answer in question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would say that the structural adjustment process that we have put in place&mdash;which the Fraser government never touched, which the honourable member for Bennelong when Treasurer never did anything about&mdash;is certainly a large part of the answer. We are going through the transition phase on that, particularly on the tariff front, and that will continue for some time yet. Whilst we go through that transition phase we will become more and more import intensive and it will be, of course, more difficult to get the current account deficit down. But it is the right way to go, as both sides of the House acknowledge, in terms of structural adjustment of the Australian economy so that we can have a more diverse array of exports and so that we are not so close to the terms of trade for rural and mineral commodities, prices of which are beyond our control and in long-term decline compared with our imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structural adjustment program that we have put in place is the right one, and it is something which the previous Liberal government never had the guts to undertake. We have undertaken that task. It is a herculean task to turn the Australian economic development model around from what has developed over two centuries to something quite different. We are achieving that, and we are achieving that very substantially with a tremendous growth of manufactured exports, of services exports and a diversification of our exports which the Opposition when it was in government could only have dreamed of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that is part of the answer but it also requires action in relation to other aspects such as savings. We have taken some steps in that direction. As I announced, we need to take some more and one of those is the measure of fiscal consolidation which we embarked on a couple of years ago and which we will intensify in the forthcoming budget.</PARA>

I am pleased to be able to indicate that the Victorian government, after some intervention by its premier, has decided to put an additional $89 million into the system over two years. On the face of it, that seems to be an improvement on the current situation but, given that some $200 million was taken out of the system, the tricks with mirrors are a bit misleading. In fact, in 1994-95 some $48.9 million will go into salaries which have to be paid just to maintain the existing levels of service, which everyone regards as inadequate. As a result, there is a net improvement of $7 million on which the hospitals will find it very difficult to manage, given the substantial 14 per cent cut that they have seen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance.

Does the BCA list illustrate the sorts of savings that are available without any slash and burn?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="39" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to the honourable member, I have seen the article. I have not yet got the BCA's list of proposed government spending cuts. The article seemed to be authoritatively based and it has been possible to look at the proposed cuts to some degree to discern what the outcomes might be and whether or not the list would hold up. I congratulate the BCA on at least giving some serious, detailed attention to this issue. It has provoked the opposition into actually providing the nearest thing so far to an indication of what cuts it might be prepared to contemplate without committing itself to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This indication came from the opposition Finance spokesman in this particular instance, not from the opposition Treasurer, who has wandered around the place for the last eight months in his usual lazy mode, talking up a storm on this issue while his party in this place voted against all the government's cuts when these things were put before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, the opposition Finance spokesman said that it illustrates the sorts of savings that are available without any slash and burn. I will just go through a couple of the biggest items. One item was a 0.5 per cent efficiency dividend across all Commonwealth outlays of $128 billion, which would realise some $600-plus million in savings if that were possible. Unfortunately, there are a few flaws in that particular proposition, interesting though it might be. A figure of 0.5 per cent on public debt interest would lead to some interesting negotiations&mdash;but that interest is included in the outlays&mdash;between ourselves and those who are interested in supplying us our deficits. I doubt very much whether that 0.5 per cent would be available short of repudiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element includes outlays which would require a great deal of amendment across the board, including pensions. Did he feel that 0.5 per cent off pensioners was not slash and burn? It would include funds available for the education systems and for family payments. Is 0.5 per cent off family payments in the education system an efficiency dividend that does not count to some form of slash and burn? And there is a 0.5 per cent efficiency dividend on resources to states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you actually come to Commonwealth outlays themselves, you find those fixed benefit payments that I referred to. However, you also find Commonwealth running costs. They already have a one per cent efficiency dividend applied to them. But if you went through them again for another 0.5 per cent and other Commonwealth purchases, you would come to a saving considerably less than $640 million; it would be around $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the BCA talked about $180 million through applying a greater activity test to the jobstart allowance. The greater activity test is to be applied to early phases of unemployment as opposed to later phases. Already, the Commonwealth has in place a very tough activity test for those who receive a jobstart allowance. The Department of Finance estimates that, by going down that road, you would realise not $180 million but something closer to $5 million or $10 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is $500 million proposed for cutting back the age at which the child could place his or her parent in a position eligible to receive a sole parent pension. An estimate is there of some $500 million. When the opposition proposed that in the course of Fightback, its estimate of savings was not $500 million but $114 million. When the department put a thumb over the opposition's statistics in the course of the last election campaign, the result was some $50 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a BCA proposal for $434 million abolishing the general subsidy on pharmaceuticals with a safety net for those with chronic illness and making them eligible for concessional payments. The BCA thinks it will be $434 million. The advice to me is that, were you to do that with the safety net provisions cutting in, depending where you set them and the greater rapidity with which you would reach it with the higher levels of payment, you would be lucky to realise at the maximum 40 per cent of those particular savings. That is the BCA list, and that is the response to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, I congratulate the BCA on providing a bit of detail and teasing out some form of preliminary opposition response on it. What we get from the opposition is nothing. We get a lecture from the opposition shadow spokesperson&mdash;who is totally lazy, despite the fact that he has been the opposition Finance spokesman and Treasurer for a very substantial period&mdash;who criticises us on the question of whether or not we are going to introduce some cuts. When it comes to his being invited to do anything about it, nothing is forthcoming. His sole contribution to politics in this country over the last couple of years has been to present Alexander Downer with the opportunity of a lifetime.</PARA>

For instance, during our time in government, 240,000 child-care places have been provided.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen under this government is a very substantial increase&mdash;indeed a revolution&mdash;in child-care. I point out again for the opposition, which likes to exploit the differences between working parent families and non-working parent families, that a quarter of those subsidised child-care places are actually provided to parents who are not in the paid work force&mdash;something they need for respite and support. We have also provided very substantial financial assistance to parents who have direct caring responsibility through the home child-care allowance. As well as providing support for those people in the work force, we have ensured that those who stay outside the work force are supported. We do not want to favour one type of family against another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, we do not favour rich families by advocating income splitting. When you ask women in particular about this question, it is very clear that they are not interested in income splitting. They know that, in the end, income splitting is a device that assists wealthy families. The money does not go to them as the principal carers of children; it ends up in the pocket of the breadwinner of the day&mdash;man or woman, as it may be. In the long term, if women are on low incomes, it discourages them from entering the work force and supplementing their income. Poor families are actually worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Income splitting is a device to divide the community. The rich get more and the poor get less.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. I refer the minister to the decision of Federal Court Justice Sackville on 10 January to set aside a woodchip export licence. What are the implications of Justice Sackville's decision for export licences issued for commodities such as coal, aluminium and liquefied natural gas worth some $30 billion a year? Will the minister now have to consult the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, before issuing a minerals export licence? Given that exports are the last hope for the nation's economy under this government's policies, what action is the minister taking to ensure our trade is not jeopardised?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question because it enables me, first of all, to address the issue of Justice Sackville's decision and then hopefully, in some way, the broader implication. Justice Sackville's decision was on the Gunns licence. For those people who are unaware of what the licence was, Gunns in Tasmania is a very prominent sawmilling operation which sought to export its residue as woodchips.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It put forward an application to me for some 450,000 tonnes of export woodchips. The first 200,000 tonnes was phase 1 and an additional 250,000 tonnes was phase 2. I approved the 200,000 tonnes as a licence for last year&mdash;phase 1&mdash;as most of that was coming from woodchips it was exporting through North Forest Products. The additional woodchips that would have made up the 450,000 tonnes were to come from trees that were already cut down. Not one single additional tree would have been harvested by Gunns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional phase 2 part of the application was for 250,000 tonnes and, because that would have had some impact on the environment, I advised Gunns that under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act that would need to be designated and referred to Senator Faulkner. I must say that it came as some surprise to me that the judgment of Justice Sackville took no account of the fact that I had conditioned the second part of the application and ruled on the 450,000 tonnes even though I had said that the second part of the application could not go ahead unless that was exactly what the judge said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Queensland member of parliament, I saw Quentin Dempster ask Joh Bjelke-Petersen about the separation of powers. Every Queensland member of parliament at least knows about the separation of powers. So we accept that Justice Sackville had the right to interpret Commonwealth law. The implications you raise are a matter that is under consideration by the whole government because there are implications for not only this portfolio but other portfolios. It is a very far-reaching judgment. The Gunns part of it, whilst surprising, was for a licence that had already expired. So whether we appeal that or not is whether we want to vindicate our original decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Werriwa for his continuing interest in competition policy. I am happy to inform the House that, despite the postponement of the COAG meeting from February to April this year, the national competition policy reforms will still come into effect on 1 July 1995. In this sittings we will introduce a bill to give national coverage of the Trade Practices Act to all businesses in Australia, including the professions. The bill will include agreements between the Commonwealth and the states to set up a national competition regime to operate in all sectors of the economy under all governments. We are committed to pursuing this because competition is the dynamic force which will drive the Australian economy, both the private sector and the public sector, into the next century. It is the only dynamic which can create sustainable jobs and promote investment to underpin a modern economy. The national framework will foster effective and fair competition to benefit ordinary consumers. As Bill Shields of the Macquarie Bank said just last week, the increasing competitive pressures over the last decade have been a major factor in achieving lower inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the Leader of the Opposition has talked somewhat glibly about the modernisation of the economy. This is from someone who as Treasurer did nothing about tariffs or the exchange rate because the National Party would not let him. As a result, Australian industry went to sleep; it was moribund. It was this government that adopted the outward-looking policies which have seen Australian industry modernise. As an example of that, the volume of trade in manufactures has increased by 60 per cent since the mid-1980s and the average growth in manufactured exports at 13 per cent each year has been more than double that of manufactured imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national competition reforms will lower business costs and promote new investment. There is a role, I can say, for the Leader of the Opposition in this if he is fair dinkum. He can show some real national leadership of his own party which will benefit mainstream Australia. He should stress to the Liberal premiers the importance of these reforms to his new found interest in further modernising Australian industry and urge them to sign on to them. It is the Liberal premiers who are dragging the chain on competition policy reform in this country. Finally, in light of the Leader of the Opposition's new found interest in modernisation I look forward to his support on the competition policy reform bill when it is introduced into the parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the last couple of days this place has been surrounded by angry and upset timber industry people. After the debacle that they have faced, the appalling mess that they have been put through and the way in which they have been treated as second-rate citizens it is no wonder that they are here. They should not have to be here, but they are here&mdash;and many of them look as though they will have to be here for a long time if they are to get sense out of the mob opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the government done its job properly we would not have had any of this mess and we would not have had this heartache or this angst. We could have secured permanently the magnificent system of conservation of high value reserves that we have in this country; those people outside would have had their investments secured; they would have had the certainty that they need and, what is more, those people whose jobs are dependent upon certainty, planning and predictability in this industry would also have had a certain future. But the fact is that they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is a mess involving a very poor economic outcome, a very poor jobs outcome and a very poor environmental outcome. The only positive is that it highlights the appalling shambles which policy making and the carrying through of policy have become under this complacent and tired government that sits opposite. If the government had been prepared to put the workers' interests&mdash;those it purports to represent&mdash;ahead of its own; if it had been prepared to put the nation's economic interests ahead of its own; and if it had been prepared to put environmental interests ahead of its own political interests, we could have avoided all this. But we have not. So here we have a reflection of everything that is wrong in the policy making process and the way things are done in this country. Just as we now see the timber industry in chaos, we see a reflection of the way the broader economy is spiralling into decay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immense damage is being done to our trade nationally. When we bring it down to this industry, it ought to be noted at the outset that we have a $1.7 billion deficit already in the timber products area. One question that needs to be asked is what the Japanese might think&mdash;and I single them out for a particular reason&mdash;of the way we do business in this country. There have been three successive ministers who have promised the Japanese that this annual debacle would finish: Minister Cook, Minister Griffiths and Minister Beddall. They have all made extravagant promises about how, with the national forest policy statement and the national assessment, this annual chaos that surrounds the issuing of export licences would come to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have made big men of themselves. It has to be asked: why would the Japanese or any of our major trading partners believe the government when it says, `Come here and buy your products; come here and invest; come here and do business?' On a local level, why should anybody have believed the current Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) when he gave all those assurances last year, not just to our foreign customers, but to Australians as well? Just before Christmas the minister&mdash;to be fair to him he probably did not realise what sort of a mess his own team was about to push him into&mdash;said in relation to the latest round of licences:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way we refer to it is that this round of licences will be bullet proof (that is) . . . every possible environmental, economic and social condition will be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA>He said there would be no more problems because the government had the environmental situation and the job and investment side sorted out to everybody's satisfaction. He went on to say&mdash;and this is rich in terms of what has transpired since then&mdash;that he could reassure the industry by promising that not a single job would be jeopardised by the environmental conditions being placed on logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also expressed frustration that day. He said that a lot of the work we have seen from the Greens has been intellectually inferior. He said that if the list put forward by the Greens was accepted, it would close down the Australian industry. He was talking not just about woodchipping but about the timber industry. I think that is pretty significant because it leads us back to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. Senator Faulkner has escaped close scrutiny on this matter but it is about time we had a look at what he got up to. He funded some pretty extraordinary people to go out and draw up some pretty interesting lists for conservation. In the state of New South Wales, $44,000 went to the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales. That assessment in New South Wales, funded by the taxpayer, was coordinated by a group of largely unidentified people about whom we know almost nothing. The question must be asked: were they qualified to make assessments?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did this group of people know better than the state forestry people, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the EPA, CALM and all those sensible environmentalists who have preferred to go down the road of the national forest policy statement. As a matter of interest, the minister might explain for us who are the people identified by the Heritage Council of New South Wales as being involved in that process simply as Natalie and others&mdash;Walcha, Dorrigo, Grafton, Glen Innes, Casino and Urbenville. Are they the self-named forest ferals that the papers covered during the summer recess? Do they consider themselves suitably qualified to make value judgments which will throw major investment, job opportunities, export income and sound environmental management out of the door?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Minister for Resources or the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories consider them to be suitably qualified? Are they the sort of people who gave the minister for the environment in Victoria the advice that in that state the Hensleigh Creek catchment has a number of values `which add to its conservation significance, including the presence of'&mdash;listen to this&mdash;`a nationally rare plant, Eucalyptus denticulata'. The information came back that that nationally rare plant identified by these groups was `formerly known as E. nitens&mdash;Shining Gum. It is a major timber species in the area and there are thousands of hectares of forest containing this species in the adjoining . . . National Park, and others in east Gippsland'. What does that say about the quality of the advice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder Victoria has formed the view that `the process that has been established has no scientific credibility. The lack of scientific credibility is clearly evidenced by the report which has been presented'. If you undermine the credibility of those who are making environmental assessments, what loses out? Environmental values. That is what loses out, if you undermine confidence in the process. That comes from the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources in Victoria. But it is not just the Victorian department that has doubts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Listen carefully to what Paul Lennon had to say&mdash;honourable members should note this&mdash;after he had renegotiated the number of coupes in Tasmania's list downwards after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made his statement last Friday. Paul Lennon just happens to be the Tasmanian shadow forests minister. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Tasmanian opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had been successful in convincing the Federal Government to reduce the number of coupes in Tasmania that will be subjected to further unnecessary assessment.</PARA>
<PARA>It had nothing to do with whether they warranted inclusion, it had to do with political pressure that changed the coupes on the list. He said that only about 70 of the original 120-odd coupes in Tasmania would now be assessed. The minister should listen carefully to this as it also reflects on the credibility of this decision making process. Mr Lennon said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If prudent and feasible alternatives to the areas identified by the Commonwealth cannot be found then the Opposition will be requiring the Federal Government to again amend the coupe list for Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact remained that the Commonwealth's response was largely political and highlighted the failure to put in place a proper process for forest management and protection. The process to make decisions on export woodchip licences and other forestry matters until now has been appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been no political leadership.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there is Labor's other great stalwart, Peter Walsh. Today, in response to the Prime Minister's statement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After some weasel words about "rescheduling", it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the statement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">tacitly admits the industry will contract&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that there will be a need for industry assistance. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, in a doomed attempt to appease extremists, a government wallowing in Budget and current account deficits intends to close down industry which employs tens of thousands, pays taxes, replaces imports and earns export income. Some of the victims of this economic sabotage will then be bought off with money the Government does not have.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have it from one of Labor's own. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In heroically Orwellian terms it then proclaims "the Government will consider the measures necessary to create a vigorous and internationally competitive wood-products industry" and "end the present uncertainty so that workers and companies alike can feel secure about their future and investments can be made in value-added processing."</PARA>
<PARA>His final comment:</PARA>

<PARA>The Prime Minister did, in fact, make some wonderful promises last Friday, as ex-Senator Walsh has said. It is his old trick again. He reinvents the wheel and then claims credit for having invented it in the first place. He says, `What we need to do is inject some stability and certainty into this debate. What we need to do is make sure that investment can take place and that people know their jobs are going to be there. We'll fix up and put in place the national forest policy statement so that regional assessments can be put in place by the year 2000&mdash;five years down the road.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a problem. All of this was signed and agreed to by responsible environmentalists, for whom we all have a great deal of sympathy, by governments&mdash;mainly Labor, but including conservative governments and Liberal governments&mdash;by the industry and by workers across this country some years ago. There was across-the-board general agreement. When were those regional assessments supposed to be in place? Not by the year 2000, as the Prime Minister now claims, but by 1995. Had they been in place none of this angst would have been necessary. We did not have to have this disruption, this undermining of confidence in the whole process of evaluating which of the magnificent areas in this country ought to be set aside and preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is about 14 billion hectares of forest at the moment and we want to look after that. There are some absolutely outstanding reserves that are the envy of the world. The coalition is absolutely committed to retaining that. In terms of the rest of the native forests of this country, we want to ensure that proper regional assessments are undertaken&mdash;as the government has now belatedly committed itself to. In 1991 we warned that the way in which this was being done&mdash;the tardiness of the whole process, the duplication, the way in which the Commonwealth was taking on roles which were not its own&mdash;would end in disaster. And it has. But it need not have. That is the point. The Prime Minister, in trying to clean up the mess that he himself put in place&mdash;the mess which he guaranteed would happen&mdash;would have us believe that he has invented the wheel when, in fact, he has only reinvented it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been inquiry after inquiry into the timber industry and report after report. The Resource Assessment Commission alone cost $40 million. The Resource Assessment Commission and the Industry Commission made it absolutely plain that the question of determining how woodchipping should be handled is a question that rightly must be attached to the issue of whether you log or do not log an area. That should be done on a regional basis, under regional assessments and under the regional forest policy statement. Then we will have the minister&mdash;he will get up here in a minute&mdash;saying that it was all the states' fault that it was never put in position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not the states' fault that it was never put in position. It is the federal government's fault. It has not got on with the job of issuing the guidelines. It is with this mob here&mdash;those who call themselves a government&mdash;that the essential blame for this whole mess lies. It is no good for the Prime Minister to now say what ought to be done. If the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and the Minister for Resources had done their jobs properly, if they had put the guidelines in place, if the contract had been properly fulfilled, they could rightly claim the title of policy geniuses. But they cannot. They have made such a mess of it that there is only one option for the three policy geniuses in all of this, and that is to go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are about getting the policy into place. As the Prime Minister said, the policy covers areas where the states have primary responsibility. This is not an area of policy failure. It provides the basis for long-term work to resolve the contentious forest issue. Until you get the RFAs up, until you get that process in place where you lock up the reserves that should be locked up for conservation value, for endangered species value, and the remainder is then available for sustainable logging, you will have this debate every year as the competing forces conflict in an annual licence process that, as I said, needs to be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy statement is very important&mdash;it is the focus of this MPI. As I said in question time, you cannot have a national forest policy statement without the largest timber state signing. I went and saw Ray Groom twice last year. People from my office met with his officials and departmental officers met right through the year. At the end of last year Tasmania was as close as we could have got to it signing. I will be talking, hopefully, to Ray Groom as soon as I can about encouraging him to participate. I would encourage the member for Braddon (Mr Miles) to be involved in that process because it is important that Tasmania become involved in the national forest policy statement. I know that there are enormous suspicions in Tasmania on both sides of politics. We have to find the will to get Tasmania involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation uses will be settled by the regional forest agreements. They can only be initiated by the state. As I said, the states have to invite us to participate. Victoria had shown interest in the regional forest agreements in the CRA process with the Central Highlands but broke off negotiations last year. The Prime Minister's announcement has considerably increased the importance of the states initiating work on the CRA and RFA processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the one real fault in the national forest policy statement was that there were no teeth&mdash;there was no way to force people at a Commonwealth or state level to participate. By announcing the phase-out of export woodchip tonnages from native forests, the Prime Minister has put that imperative there. In future, as tonnages decrease, the export tonnages will be favoured from those areas that have regional forest agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I get into those issues, I want to get back to some of the basic facts that are on the table; facts that I think were lost in the chase over Christmas by a lot of people for cheap publicity. Australia's forests and forest product industries are important to Australia; very important, as the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has said, in regional Australia. They employ around 85,000 people in growing, harvesting, manufacture and processing of wood and paper products. The states control the resource. The Commonwealth only controls the licence of export woodchips. I repeat that: the Commonwealth only has powers over the export of woodchips. We do not have powers over forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All up, Australia has about 41 million hectares of native forests. Of those, around 30 million hectares are in public ownership, and only about a quarter of that is available for multiple use including wood production. Old growth forests are not logged primarily for woodchips; they are logged for sawlogs. Woodchips are a by-product of sawlog harvesting, sawmill operations and forest management operations such as thinning. However, the sale of woodchips creates a commercial outlet for waste material which would otherwise be left to rot on the forest floor or be burnt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recess there was some criticism about the increase in tonnages. The increase in tonnage this year occurred because a Queensland company received a licence. It was interesting to see that the local Maryborough environment group came out in support of that licence because the group had been campaigning for some time about the burning of sawmill residue and the impact that had on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister said, Australia has a dreadful timber deficit of $1.7 billion. In this country we should be doing more about value adding. This is a way to keep the value in Australia and create new jobs. It will also import replace and create further export opportunities. We have very innovative small firms capitalising on our excellence in timber products. We must have more. The industry is the economic backbone of regional Australia. It provides jobs in areas where there are no alternative jobs. If these jobs go there is no obvious replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the opposition's forest policy? All we got from the opposition's environment statement was that it was going to flog off Telecom to plant trees. Why is the opposition not out there talking about sustainable industry and about how we, as a country, have to achieve that difficult balancing act concerning the retention of all our forest values?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone seems to have made the assumption that I quite deliberately did not follow normal processes in considering the licence renewals. Nothing could be further from the truth. A systematic process has been in place for many years. The same process has been followed by former resource ministers. The responsibilities of resource and environment ministers have been built in and have been accepted by former and existing ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I followed the same process that had been used in former years. The steps I went through and the issues I was required to consider were the same. There is no truth in any claim that in some way I was cavalier about how I approached my responsibilities. As I said, nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What changed in this debate was that on 10 January Justice Sackville handed down a decision that, against all expectations, overturned the Gunns licence. If we take the time to read the Sackville judgment we will see that he raised questions about the premise upon which the longstanding process was based. He put forward a new view as to how the process might be defined and designed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 the action minister has been required to designate the proponent if he believes that the proposal is likely to affect the environment to a significant extent. Designated woodchip operations in each of the woodchipping states are subject to environmental assessments intended to protect the environmental values over a number of years. Justice Sackville seems to question the long established premise underlying the renewal process; the premise that, based on the recommendation of any Commonwealth EIS at the time of issuing the long-term in-principle approval, the action minister may issue periodic licences without further reference to the minister for the environment. This is a premise that had been accepted by all ministers over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question of bad administration, as some in the press have tried to make out. Only they know the motives for putting forward such a point of view. The Sackville decision has created a great deal of uncertainty. The government has acted to give certainty back to the licence process. The Prime Minister announced that I would be writing to the companies to do this. I have written to the exporters and the state ministers today. I drew their attention to the new licence conditions that I imposed on 20 December 1994&mdash;a fact that has been completely overlooked in the reporting since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a point or two about the letter that I wrote today. I pointed out two things. The first was the verification of the values of each coupe to ensure that they have retained conservation values&mdash;that is, the list of 509 that was mentioned in the Prime Minister's statement. Secondly, I alerted the states to identify alternate coupes in which harvesting can be undertaken in order to maintain wood volumes as far as practicable. Those are important caveats that I think should be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sackville decision has created that uncertainty. We have asked the companies to assess for themselves whether it is in their interests to apply for a new licence and surrender the existing licence. People have painted that as a requirement that they must surrender. The government is not saying that at all. The government is saying that Sackville has created a degree of uncertainty about the licence process. If the companies wish to assure their customers, they can apply for a new licence. If the licence was granted, any tonnage that they had on the previous licence and that had been exported would be subtracted from the new licence. It is not a question of reducing volumes. There may be additional environmental concerns that have to be taken into account in view of the Sackville decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the overall process that I announced on 20 December, these conditions do not focus on the number of coupes because we tried to avoid that. The former Minister for Resources, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), pointed out to me that last year he set aside 17 coupes. This time I set aside 85 coupes. It was considered to be something like a cricket match&mdash;85 out of 1,300. The conditions I have put on the new licences are the toughest conditions that the Commonwealth has ever imposed. They will ensure that logging happens in a way that looks out for all the forest values that we want to protect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it. We are logging in native forests. That logging must be done responsibly, and it must be done in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Commonwealth and state environment legislation. Such things as endangered species protection, Aboriginal and heritage considerations and water quality must be taken into account. Only by proper conditions&mdash;conditions that are followed and monitored to make sure that they are abided by&mdash;can we be confident that logging is carried out responsibly and minimises the impact on other forest values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highly upgraded monitoring regime that I announced on 20 December has not been recognised as the important step forward that it is. In my letter to the states and the exporting companies I have drawn their attention to these new conditions and told them quite clearly that they will be vigorously enforced. The Prime Minister also recognised the importance of this initiative in his statement of 22 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I have also invited exporters to submit applications for new licences. I have approved logging in some national estate coupes. I also advised the states and companies of coupes that are judged to have high conservation value which may be required for inclusion in a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system as proposed in the national forest policy statement that we are debating here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sought the cooperation of the states and the exporting companies in avoiding the acceptance of woodchips from these coupes until these values have been verified. The re-scheduling studies will verify the values. The first step is to ensure that the identified coupes have in fact retained conservation values sufficient for their inclusion in a national reserve system. We are working with the states to see that logging activities in coupes judged to have retained values are re-scheduled, pending formal assessment for inclusion in any national reserve developed through the regional forest agreement process set up under the national forest policy statement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We are basically sending woodchips overseas and importing them back as value added products. Towards the end of the century quite a few areas of the world will have plantations for the specific purpose of woodchips that will take up a hell of a lot of the world market. In other words, towards the end of the century&mdash;maybe a little after&mdash;there will be an enormous hole in the world market for woodchips. If in Australia we have not developed a value adding industry for woodchips, there will be no market for those woodchips.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go back to where this whole policy should be going. The timber industry needs to sit back and have a look at where it wants to be, where its market is going to be and what products it wants to have in five or 10 years time. We are interested in a sustainable long-term industry that provides jobs for the people of Australia, not a quick fix that is going to cost jobs in the long term. The means of achieving that is through these regional forest agreements. That national forest policy statement has been signed by all the states except Tasmania. I am not sure whether Tasmania is keen on signing it; it is certainly making some offers at present, I understand. One can only assume by that signing by the states and the Commonwealth that there is general agreement there. Then you can only ask, as I said before, why these RFAs and CRAs have not progressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the federal government can say, `We are blameless in that.' I point out again that it can happen only at the invitation of the states. That can achieve a representative reserve of those values that the community thinks are valuable in those regions and it can also give certainty to the timber industry in the future. These are the ways to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timber industry is an important industry. It employs 85,000 people in the growing and harvesting of wood and in the manufacture and processing of wood and paper products throughout Australia. That is an example of the sorts of jobs that are available&mdash;nearly all in rural and regional areas, such as my own electorate. </PARA>

Now that does not make it worth going into the forests and taking out the rubbish, the thinnings and all that sort of thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted by question time, I was talking about the question of regional identification of goods. The government is planning to move an amendment to section 65VE(2) of the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill to make it quite clear that this legislation does permit identification of a particular place in this way as part of an express and unambiguous representation that the goods are Australian. The amendment states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A representation in the Table may be followed by words that identify a particular place in Australia or a particular part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The words `followed by' have caused some concern. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) noted in her second reading speech that some people have suggested this means that all references to `place' have to follow the authorised term. This is a misunderstanding of the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is in a section dealing with express and unambiguous claims. It applies only to the positioning of place names when they are used as part of an express and unambiguous claim made under proposed new section 65VE. It does not apply to the positioning of such statements such as `Tableland cheese', `Queensland sugar' or `Proudly Queensland', which are covered by proposed section 65VJ, or  statements like `Brewed in Cairns', which fall within proposed section 65VG. The bill has no provision which covers the placement, size or number of these representations, provided the goods really are Australian. The supplementary explanatory memorandum clarifies this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation refers to goods either produced or made in Australia. However, I think in the future we will look to legislation of a different sort that gives consumers further information about goods that come from overseas. It is interesting to note that last year the US Congress passed legislation which provided for goods to carry labels saying that they were not produced by child labour. I think that is a natural progression from this sort of legislation and will obviously enhance the consumer's information about such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the legislation. It provides simplicity and a framework for consumer education in this matter, which is the most important thing. Let us get the bill passed&mdash;it has simplicity&mdash;and then we can educate the public. That is what they want. They want to buy Australian goods, and this bill will assist them in that way.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V5">Mr SLIPPER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are referring to the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill. I am very pleased to support the amendments to be moved by the coalition. The aim of this bill is to insert a new division into the Trade Practices Act to make provision for certain rules and regulations relating to the labelling of goods which are claimed to be made, manufactured, packed or designed in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill focuses on representations made about Australian origins on consumer goods. At the present time, there are no requirements which clearly set out the terms to be used to describe products with Australian content. The present meaning of the words `Made in Australia' is as determined by the courts of this land. That interpretation by the courts broadly encompasses the essential character test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This item of legislation has been kicked around in the community and in the parliament for a long time. The country of origin labelling issue has been the subject of two working groups, and the government bill has been the subject of a House of Representatives inquiry and a Senate committee inquiry. The coalition fully supports the principle of truth in labelling, because we believe that when someone goes into a store or a supermarket it is important that that person knows where products come from. Then the shopper is able to make an intelligent decision on whether to buy Australian made products or products from other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sick and tired of going into retail outlets and seeing products being passed off as though they are produced in this country. The electorate of Fisher grows perhaps more pineapples than any other part of Australia. Yet, when you go into a number of these stores, you see very many generic products proudly displaying the Australian flag in colours of green and gold. The consumer who is in a hurry has been known on very many occasions to pick up that imported product on the basis that the product was thought to be Australian. It is only when he or she gets home that there is a realisation that he or she has been duped. Therefore, I commend the government on the general principle behind this particular bill. The Australian public really wants to know what products are Australian and what products are not Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the shadow minister for consumer affairs, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), also mentioned the problems faced by the peanut industry. With the recent redistribution, I inherit the whole of Kingaroy shire from the honourable member. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the peanut industry is a vital industry in that area. I was shocked at the example outlined in the parliament just a couple of hours ago by the honourable member for Wide Bay when he indicated how American product was being passed off as though it came from the shire of Kingaroy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall another instance where I purchased a can of what I thought was Australian salmon. It was labelled Australian salmon, yet when I looked very closely I saw that it was a product of New Zealand. I think that the packaging of very many of these imported products is designed to con, rob and cheat the Australian taxpayer. Indeed, in doing so, they cost Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the principle behind this bill is good. The only problem is that a number of the provisions of the bill are flawed and inadequate. I do not intend in the parliament to impugn the sincerity or honesty of the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh). I believe that she has tried to do the right thing, but what she should be doing is accepting the amendments to be moved by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) on behalf of the coalition. If she did this, we would have no argument with the bill. We would support strongly this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is unfortunate that this bill, even with the amendments moved by the government, is still inadequate. Certainly the amendments proposed by the government improve the bill, but sadly they are too little, too late. The government itself might well have other motives, possibly seeking a trigger for a double dissolution. Perhaps that is why the legislation is being brought forward in this way. The government would then have a double dissolution trigger, believing that it would be knocked back in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the bill as proposed by the government introduces different representations of what is Australian, and there are certain conditions to the use of those representations. The words `Produce of Australia' or `Product of Australia' apply to those products where Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods and all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. The government has a second term which it uses, and that is `Made in Australia'. These words under the government's legislation apply to goods which acquire their essential character or qualities in Australia. That means there could be a substantial imported component in goods which are able to be labelled `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider the case of a can of baked beans. Under the government's legislation, if it were to be implemented, a can of baked beans could be marked `Made in Australia' but the beans could be imported. They could well have been cooked here. Our Australian culinary expertise might have been used. We may well have enclosed the beans in an Australian can. In that situation, the producer or distributor would be able to say that that product was an Australian product, whereas everyone in the country would think it was not. The government is offside with opinion from industry and from the Australian people. I do not see that the government has many friends in its advocacy of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of those who take a different approach from that taken by the government. These people support the opposition's contention that the terms `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia' and `Made in Australia' be used only when everything relating to the goods to which those terms apply was done in Australia. It would apply, for example, to food grown in Australia. The goods would have to be totally Australian in every respect. As we indicated in our amendments, another category should exist for goods which we would describe as being manufactured in Australia. These would include some imported element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some organisations which do not agree with the government's approach and which support what the opposition parties are seeking to achieve through their amendments include the SPC cannery; the South Australian Farmers Federation; the Citrus Growers Federation; the Winemakers Federation of Australia; Foodland stores; even the ACTU; Darling Downs Bacon Co-op Association Ltd; Jasol Australia; the Australian Consumers Federation; the Riverland Horticultural Council; Chateau Yaldara; Ward, McKenzie; The Magic Products Corporation; Willow Ware Australia; Southern Cross Packaged Goods&mdash;and the list goes on. The minister really has not won herself any friends by bringing in the bill as it stands today. The bill is flawed, and could well have been improved by taking on board the opposition's suggestions. But, for some reason, the government has failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government brought forward the original bill in 1994 and it is now suggesting that there ought to be a couple of extra changes. Those changes include the provision that not only is the name of our country&mdash;the word `Australia'&mdash;to be used, but also it is possible for the producer or the manufacturer to state that a product has been produced, manufactured or grown in a particular part of the country. That amendment is important. It is certainly an improvement on the original bill. Queensland pineapples, Tasmanian salmon and Queensland wine&mdash;maybe even South Australian wine&mdash;are entitled to have on their packaging information some indication of which part of the country they come from. In a federation the size of Australia, people often like to buy locally; by doing so, they are boosting local industry. That provision was a serious omission from the bill as submitted to the parliament last year. I am very pleased to see that the minister and the government have at least remedied that oversight. There are a couple of other relatively minor alterations to the original bill, but that is the major alteration. It means that regional labelling can be incorporated in packaging. Another problem I have with the bill relates to clause 65VJ, which says that a corporation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . must not supply goods that carry a representation in words, pictures or symbols that is likely to be regarded as an Australian origin representation unless the goods also carry at least one of the following . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Subclause 65VJ(a) then refers to the categories of `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia' or `Made in Australia'. The clause further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)a representation in words that identifies one or more of the production steps that happened in Australia;  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)a representation in words that identifies one or more of the pre-production steps that happened in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)a representation in words that indicates that the place of origin of the goods is outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, I do not think it is appropriate to use Australian symbols that indicate that a product is Australian when it is not Australian but is, for example, Korean or Japanese. What about honesty and truth in labelling? While the government certainly says that the place of origin should be included on the label, it would, for example, be deceitful to have `Made in Korea' along with a depiction of a kangaroo or an Australian flag on the label. Importers who are seeking to have Australian symbols on such products are trying to cash in on the loyalty of Australian consumers who try to buy Australian products because they know that such purchases not only reduce imports&mdash;that area is in a terrible situation the moment&mdash;but also create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition amendments seek to define the terms `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia' or `Made in Australia' to mean that Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods and that all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. The terms `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia' and `Made in Australia' mean something to most people. Most people you talk to in the community consider that those three representations should refer to products that are wholly Australian. Some surveys have been done which support this understanding. A Quadrant survey showed that 74 per cent of consumers believe that products labelled `Made in Australia' should not contain imported ingredients. The CSIRO national nutrition survey of January 1994 found that 98 per cent of people agreed that food should not be labelled Australian made unless it was both grown and processed entirely within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importers who try to pass their products off as Australian are trying to cash in on the loyalty and the national sentiment of the Australian consumer. A Coles survey done in October 1993 showed that 89 per cent of people&mdash;up from 86 per cent the previous year&mdash;prefer to buy locally manufactured food products. That brings us to the essence of what the coalition is seeking to achieve. We are saying that the government ought to make clear what is Australian made and what is not totally Australian made so that the shopper is able to make a decision on what he or she buys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said that it is going to conduct some kind of massive public education program to try to educate people to understand what the government deems the words `Made in Australia' to mean. Why on earth should the government waste this money when everyone in the country currently understands what the words `Made in Australia' mean? The only reason the government has to look at conducting this education program is that it needs to change in the mind of the Australian public the meaning of the words `Made in Australia'. The plain meaning of those words has already been reinforced by a $15 million public education campaign which has been run over the last eight years. The minister intends to rule the book off on that campaign and come in and re-educate the Australian people,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meaning of the words `Manufactured in Australia' is also very clear. Something that is manufactured in Australia is mostly Australian but may well have some imported content. The Food Policy Alliance, representing the ACTU, the Australian Consumers Federation, the Australian Canned Fruit Growers, the Victorian Farmers Federation, the South Australian Farmers Federation and SPC, has said that the proposal which would allow imported food products to be labelled `Made in Australia' would leave Australian consumers with a dog's breakfast of confusing regulations and labelling. That alliance brings together a group of Australians who would not normally be seen dead together&mdash;a group of concerned Australians from across the political spectrum. I do not understand why this minister has failed to take on board what everyone else in the country is saying. We have the minister on one side and everyone else on the other side. Why will the minister not accept the collective advice and wisdom of not only the coalition but also the Australian people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the protracted and difficult passage of this legislation to date, the government really ought to reconsider the coalition's proposed amendments. Our amendments are sensible, reasonable, rational, and publicly supported. We seek to make sure that when Australians go to a supermarket, store or trader, they know which product is Australian and which product comes from somewhere else. I am certain that the government would like to make sure that the public can make an intelligent decision on what is Australian and what is not Australian. I do not impugn the sentiments or motives of the minister. I just do not know why we cannot get it through to her that our proposed amendments should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought in Australia has created incredible financial difficulty for people in both urban and rural areas. Farm indebtedness to financial institutions is reported as having blown out from $6 billion in 1982 to an estimated $17.2 billion in 1993; it is probably close to $20 billion today. Rural Australia, which produces so much of our food products, will be disadvantaged if the bill in its current form is implemented by the government. Rural Australia provides perhaps 20 billion big reasons why the government should go back to the drawing board and develop a more honest what-you-see-is-what-you-get `Made in Australia' labelling system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeking to get the government to enshrine honesty, openness and accountability into this legislation so that a person will be able to decide and make a choice whether to buy something that is Australian, partly Australian or not Australian. Should the government's legislation become law, we will have a situation where people will still be conned, robbed, cheated and deceived into buying products which they think are Australian at the time they buy them, yet when then get them home they find the products are indeed not wholly Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people buy Australian products it boosts the economy and creates jobs. The government ought to pick up our suggestion. I am disappointed that it has not done so to date. Should the government pick up our suggestion, I believe it would make a wonderful contribution towards boosting rural industry and industry generally, and it would go a long way towards capitalising, in an economic sense, on the product loyalty of Australians who want to buy Australian. I hope the minister will take on board what I and other coalition speakers have said. This is a very important subject. I think the government stands condemned for not yet having picked up what we have suggested, but it is not too late. I strongly support the amendments proposed by the coalition, and indeed I hope that the government adopts our suggestions. </PARA>

I acknowledge that the number of speakers who have thus far addressed the issue signifies the interest the origin labelling debate has generated and the importance of this issue to the Australian economy.

It has to be borne in mind that origin labelling is a positive step towards assisting Australian businesses and producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I will explain, and as has already been explained, some of the concerns raised by the opposition are wide of the mark. They have been raised simply to take up some of the misconceptions in the community about the term `Made in Australia'. These were clarified in a court case some time ago: they obviously preceded the introduction of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill responds to ad hoc development by state and federal governments over the years in this area. The states have had a substantial say in labelling over the years, and confusion has been caused, particularly for people who wished to import into Australia, as well as for those who wished to export from Australia. Different states had different regulations. Also, there was a parochial need for something to be seen to be exported from a particular state rather than from Australia. In many instances the area or state was not recognised by the purchaser in overseas countries which meant that there was confusion; they did not realise they were getting something grown or produced in Australia. Hence&mdash;I would say quite correctly&mdash;when the label was not correct, they tended to steer away from it. That is what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While members opposite may not entirely agree with the bill, and they certainly have every right to do so, the intention of this legislation is to clarify the origin labelling issue so that it is able to be understood by manufacturers and consumers alike. That misunderstanding was borne out in the court cases which went to the issue of the term `Made in Australia' and what it could and could not mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to take account of the international definition. If we want to go it alone and have our own little version and meanings of things, we can by all means do that and stay in our own cage. But if we want to compete in and be part of the world system, which we do, we have to take on board what the rest of the world sees as the necessary definition of some of these terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we have done in this bill and I commend the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) for it. She has applied an Australianisation version of it, if you like, so that the whole issue is applicable to what is required in Australia and to Australian understanding. I see no point in introducing another definition so similar to the term `Made in Australia' such as `Manufactured in Australia' or whatever else is proposed in the amendment proposed by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this legislation will give consumers what they want&mdash;goods that are manufactured or produced in Australia and clearly marked as such. Certainly, the success of the Australian Made and Buy Australian campaigns have emphasised the importance of buying a product that is made or produced in Australia, obviously where the cost and the value are comparable. Consumers throughout Australia are now more than ever checking the labels of items they intend to purchase to check the origin of the product and its ingredients and components. I have no doubt that consumers have their preferences for products&mdash;wines, apples, citrus, or even dairy products&mdash;from certain areas. If they wish to exercise that preference, they can do so. If companies, cooperatives or growers are in a position to be able to exploit that&mdash;parochialism in that sense&mdash;it is positive and good for them. This labelling does not prevent that. In fact, it ensures that there is no unfair competition in that sense along those lines. The labelling has to be correct and cannot be misleading. It cannot imply that a product has come from somewhere when it has not done so. In the majority of cases people buy locally made or produced products when they are able to. They search for that label. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been developed following extensive consultation with consumers, manufacturers and their respective representative organisations. I refute the comments of some of the speakers opposite on this legislation who said that there has been no consultation or little consultation or that the minister has not listened. The minister has listened and has sought opinions of all types and from different sources on this type of legislation and how it should be applied. I commend the minister for her commitment to achieve a uniform, easily identifiable and easily recognisable labelling system. I cannot stress too strongly the importance of the need for clear and easy to understand labelling of consumer products. If I buy a product in Tweed Heads, Byron Bay or Ballina which says `Made in Australia' or `Product of Australia', I want to know that that product has been made in Australia&mdash;not overseas&mdash;and from Australian components. If something is made in Australia from imported components, I want to know that before I make my purchase. As I represent an area with high unemployment, I believe it is imperative to maintain and sustain local jobs. That is why this legislation is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fisher mentioned the importance to the economy of buying Australian products. It is very important. As consumer awareness heightens, people are demanding&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that they receive what they believe they are buying. People realise that buying local products is important for the long-term future of Australia and that supporting local products promotes economic growth and long-term prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no longer good enough to see a product advertised with symbols or objects that are uniquely Australian&mdash;such as our flag, the koala, the kangaroo or the emu&mdash;only to find a sticker somewhere on the product which says `Product of Taiwan', `Product of Korea', `Product of Japan', `Product of China' or `Product of the United States'. I certainly do not object to these products being available, but I do object to the fact that this gives people the perception or image that these products are Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members will be aware, the bill allows for three types of labelling: `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia' and `Made in Australia'. These three phrases are fairly easy to understand and pack the required punch. A product carrying this labelling will certainly be exactly what it says&mdash;produce of Australia, a product of Australia or made in Australia. I do not think I can be any clearer than that in terms of the need for labelling. I believe that the terms are fairly self-explanatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there has been some divergence of opinion on the other side of the House as to the correctness of that and the applicability of it. But these three terms go a long way in terms of practicality, of what we can achieve, of simplicity and of understanding. I hope this legislation will weed out those manufacturers of goods who are not entirely honest about the nature or origin of the ingredients in their products. I take my hat off to the manufacturers who have been complying with current guidelines and who are honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My area has a large proportion of small businesses as opposed to large manufacturers and I think that this bill is very much to their benefit. If there are shonks out there, the bill will target them. If we did not need legislation, we would not be introducing this bill. It has been introduced because there is a problem out there and we are responding to it. It is in response to that problem that this legislation introducing changes to origin labelling has been brought forward, and it will be to the benefit of industries and small businesses. In some ways, although those who cry foul of the system are not necessarily part of this, they are certainly inadvertently supporting those manufacturers or retailers of goods which are not necessarily what they claim to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill, `Produce of Australia' means that Australia was the place of origin of each of the major ingredients or components of the goods, and that all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. `Product of Australia' means that the production of the goods happened here. I think that is clear enough. The consumer surveys&mdash;which those on the other side want to ignore&mdash;indicate that the number of people who misinterpreted the term `Made in Australia' is decreasing and that the number of people who understand the difference between `Product of Australia', `Produce of Australia' and `Made in Australia' is increasing substantially. Consumer awareness is there and these labels certainly will not add to the confusion. On the contrary, they will remove the confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To carry the `Made in Australia' label, products must have acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. Essentially, that is what the court has determined. That is all that is required. Contrary to the remarks of some speakers on the other side, the government has not determined it or, as the honourable member for Fisher indicated, the government has not deemed its meaning. We are working with the term `Made in Australia' that was determined by a court. We are responding to that. We are actually adding to the whole gamut of labelling and clarifying it substantially so that, as I indicated, if a product bears the label `Made in Australia', the goods must have acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to say that the bill also allows for the recognition of a particular region. This means that, for instance, Tweed bananas&mdash;which are produced in my area&mdash;will be able to be packaged as `Product of Australia' with `Tweed' or `Tweed Bananas' also on the label. That is going to be welcomed by the producers and manufacturers in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill has been the subject of some rigorous debate&mdash;and there is no doubt more to come&mdash;and has been investigated by a number of committees, namely, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the need for this legislation is undeniable. The drafting and consultation process has taken over 18 months, which means that everybody from consumers to manufacturers who had concerns about the draft legislation were able to express an opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill inserts a new division into the Trade Practices Act 1974. This division deals with representations made about goods claimed to be of Australian origin which are labelled `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia' or `Made in Australia'. The definitions of the terms are closely linked to determinations by the Federal Court involving litigation arising from the Trade Practices Act 1974. During the drafting stage of the legislation, the need for practical legislation and guidelines became apparent. We really did not need&mdash;or, for that matter, want&mdash;a consumer revolution. That would certainly require years to explain and implement. But, if you were to ask people, as I have, exactly what the term `Made in Australia' meant, they would realise that it is not a closely defined and tight term and that there is some looseness in it. Certain organisations and industries over the years have got around it by labelling products `Australian Made', `Australian Manufactured' or `Made in Australia', even though certain amounts of the components of their item or product were made overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology concluded that the approach taken in this bill is probably the best in practical terms. The working group determined in May 1993 that it is practical because it does not advocate a specific percentage to be used in determining the Australianness of a good, ingredient or component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some goods and their ingredients are quantifiable, others are not so easy. `Produce of Australia' means that Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods, and that all operations involved in manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. `Product of Australia' means that the production of the goods happened in Australia, while goods labelled `Made in Australia' must have acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can argue what constitutes `major' until you are blue in the face, but essentially it means what it says. It does not mean 75 per cent, 85 per cent or 95 per cent but that the major ingredients of the product come from Australia. I believe that products which meet this criteria will have an advantage in the marketplace over products that contain largely imported ingredients or goods that have been made overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 also deals with goods that either contain an Australian component or have been partly manufactured or processed in Australia. Goods in this category must be labelled accordingly. For example, goods could be labelled `Built in Australia Using Imported Timbers' or `Processed in India'. The bill also requires that a good cannot carry a representation that makes people perceive that good to be made in Australia unless it can do so justifiably. This will put an end to those cute but deceptive and misleading souvenir shops that carry goods accompanied by symbols of our flag or native animals and the almost hidden sticker that says the goods are made in some overseas country. Further, it is a requirement of the bill that goods containing ingredients from more than one country in equal proportion must recognise both countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you can see, the essential context of the bill is quite simple. The bill will provide consumers with information on what they have purchased. It deserves the support of the House. Some of the changes which members of the opposition have asked for in their call for the use of the term `Manufactured and Made in Australia' would see substantial changes to that which we have allowed in this legislation. It would be a backwards step, as the major ingredient or component of many products presently made in Australia&mdash;whether we are taking about clothing, household goods, furniture, sporting goods, tyres or whatever&mdash;is derived here. At present, these products are proudly labelled `Made in Australia' because the value adding is done here. If the definition the opposition is proposing were acceded to, many of those manufactured items could not be labelled `Made in Australia'. I think that would lead to a loss of jobs, particularly in the local economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the whole issue has been rather emotive and pushed in some ways, whether for good reasons or for bad. But the opposition is entitled to oppose the bill and put forward its amendments. That is part of the process. The government amendment for extending the phase-in period for the legislation from 12 to 18 months was a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. At the request of that committee, and also what is perceived as being a need in the community, that has been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment makes it clear that, when a supplier wants to identify a particular place as part of an express or unambiguous claim that the goods originated in Australia, it may be done by adding the extra name of the place after the authorised term; hence `Product of New South Wales', `Produced in Australia', `Product of Kempsey' or Tweed Heads, Sunraysia, the Mallee or wherever it might be. I commend the legislation to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that we on both sides do agree with is that the legislation is certainly timely. Many speakers have stood in here and given examples of the kind of dishonesty that has taken place in duping Australian consumers. I am very pleased that Australians have a commitment to support their domestic industries and that they go to the supermarket shelf, or to the hardware store, and deliberately seek out Australian products because they know it means Australian jobs. So I agree with the member for Richmond that this legislation is certainly timely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member mentioned that origin labelling is a positive step. It is just a bit unfortunate that this is really only half a step. We on this side of the House are not proposing the amendments, as has been suggested, for any political trickery. The amendments we are proposing are vital to citrus growers and dried fruit growers, predominant industries in my electorate, who provide a valuable contribution to this nation's wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A variety of countries, some of which are our major trading competitors&mdash;such as the United States, New Zealand, Singapore, Canada, Germany and Japan&mdash;have attempted to promote their domestic economies by means of country of origin labelling. But examining what those countries have done is of little assistance to us because we in Australia have a confusing range of methods to describe Australianness. This has crept up on us over the last decade or so. It has created what can only be regarded as major obstacles and a great diversity of community expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House seek to preserve the generic term `Made in Australia' to what consumers have come to know and understand when they buy a product and want to support domestic industries. The suggestion that a product can have that label and have imported ingredients does not meet the expectations of consumers. This is what motivates the coalition to suggest improvements to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) has been aware of these suggestions for some time, and I am just a bit disappointed that she has not taken these suggestions up&mdash;for reasons known only to her. There has been a ground swell of opinion and support, which has driven our desire to put the amendments before this chamber. One of my colleagues in the other chamber who had responsibility for this legislation said that one would need the wisdom of Solomon to sort through the plethora of opinions on the matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, no-one has argued that there is no need for changes. There has been no joy for commodity producers in consistent court challenges on what does or does not comply with the current Trade Practices Act. Currently, there are no present requirements that prescribe or clearly define the terms to be used to describe products or produce with Australian content. As I have said, the present meaning of `Made in Australia' is that which is defined by the courts, which broadly encompasses the essential character test. The citrus and dried fruit producers in my electorate have particular problems with that essential character test, which I will address shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's definition of `Made in Australia', as justified by the government, has been consistent with recent Federal Court decisions. Personally, I think this legislation should confirm what consumers, not courts, expect. It ought to be the purpose of this place to make law&mdash;not respond to what courts necessarily say. After all, we are here representing constituencies. The Trade Practices Act, as it currently stands, makes it a specific offence for a firm to make a misleading representation concerning the place of origin of goods. In addition, the Food Standards Code regulates country of origin labelling for food. Sadly, these measures have not been sufficient to adequately address the problems and to make things absolutely clear to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has made reference to items he has purchased in a store and taken home and then discovered are made from imported ingredients. Sadly, most consumers consume their product without even knowing that, whether it is Turkish dried fruit, Turkish apricots or Chinese peanuts. People think they have done the right thing by being Australian and supporting the domestic industry and are not even aware that what they are consuming is actually imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the bill has had a good airing. The legislation has been the subject of a number of parliamentary working groups, which led to its formulation, and since then two parliamentary inquiries, which has to be a precedent. But every time a divergence of opinion emerges. An enormous amount of community and media focus has been the result, and it still amazes me that the minister and the government have not shifted their position other than to agree to some amendments addressing regional origins. It is of some disappointment to me that, in some of the contributions made by government speakers, we in opposition have been labelled as being deliberately contrary in proposing to move our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendments are designed to preserve the expectations of consumers and to retain the integrity of what the consumers regard `Made in Australia' to mean. Like it or not, the prevailing view is that this term is synonymous with what is being proposed in the bill as `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia'. The understanding which is held is that `Made in Australia' applies to goods which are grown and put together&mdash;fabricated and manufactured&mdash;here. When applied to food, which is the area of commodities which my constituency is most concerned with, the process of value adding of that food leads to a confusion of what `made' means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and a number of other speakers made reference to a range of surveys which have been conducted and which support the understanding and expectations of consumers. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> survey has been mentioned. A nutritional survey was instigated by the CSIRO in 1994 which suggested that 98 per cent of food should not be labelled Australian made unless it was both grown and processed entirely within Australia. All this, and the expectations of consumers, is supported by a Coles survey back in 1993 which reported the intentions of consumers. Some 89 per cent of them said they preferred to buy locally manufactured food products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that the government has consulted widely, but I am somewhat disappointed that, as a result of over 60 submissions to the government's various working groups and over 5,000 items of correspondence, the minister has not moved her position on this legislation. I think it is a great pity that greater emphasis has not been given to consumers; it has been given more to manufacturers. After all, it is the consumers in the shopping place who consume the products which primary producers produce, particularly food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government should have conducted its own consumer based surveys. It might have got a better picture of the expectations of consumers. It is a ridiculous situation, after years of education and literally millions of dollars of government and taxpayers' money&mdash;producers' and manufacturers' money&mdash;promoting `Made in Australia', that the government's only flag is a measly budget allocation of $800,000, which it hopes will be sufficient to change that public perception. It is simply not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not particularly want to be critical of the minister. She did honour a commitment she had made: she visited my electorate in July last year to explain her position. She spoke to citrus and dried fruit organisations. After those consultations she took two existing labels before the Trade Practices Commission. They are clearly very offensive to current law and have angered my grower constituency. Unfortunately, she was not able to persuade my dried fruit growers and other food processers to her point of view. They maintain ongoing opposition to the bill in its present form. This is the major reason I support the changes proposed by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister relies very heavily on the capacity of the National Food Authority to address all the concerns which have been expressed in regard to the labelling of food. Her confidence in that approach is not shared by my grower organisations, and certainly is not shared by me. I refer specifically to a response by the Australian Dried Fruits Association of 12 August to the minister, a response which followed from her visit to Mildura in my electorate on 26 July last year. The ADFA wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The passage of the Bill will entrench an inappropriate definition of the term "Made in Australia" and place far too much reliance upon later actions of the National Food Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>It also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That labelling of this type should provide consumers with meaningful information on which they can base their purchase decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>I support the changes which the ADFA particularly wants to see. I am not convinced by the minister's confidence that the National Food Authority will want to solve all the problems associated with the labelling of food. It is, after all, an organisation that is made up of state representations. It is always difficult to get a uniform view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has said consistently over the past 12 months that most of the complaints in respect of the bill relate to food. That is true. Her suggestion that the National Food Authority should be lobbied to introduce requirements to identify the source of ingredients in food products has not been enthusiastically received. I believe that the National Food Authority would regard this legislation, once it has become enacted, as the definitive government work and would not be prepared to go beyond trade practices law. That would be the basis for the National Food Authority declining to take further action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the minister and the government are able to reassure the parliament on how they intend to pressure the National Food Authority to achieve such an objective to cover all the concerns relating to food, then, like the Australian Dried Fruits Association, I am not inclined to support the bill in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other speakers have made reference to a great range of organisations that have been making contributions on this legislation. In addition to the ADFA, the member for Fisher mentioned large Australian food processers such as Ardmona and SPC; the National Farmers Federation; the Victorian Farmers Federation; the Food Policy Alliance; my own Australian Citrus Growers Federation and its local representation, the Murray Valley Citrus Marketing Board; the Australian Canning Fruit Growers Association; and many more which other speakers have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much representation does it take to convince the government? It is interesting that in a rather unusual alliance, the Australian trade union organisation, the ACTU, has also made representations to the government urging it to modify this bill along the lines now being suggested by the opposition. This representation was still continuing as recently as the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly refer to the reason my dried fruit growers are concerned about this bill: the essential character test as proposed for category B in section 65VE(2) of the bill. In the government's proposal, `Made in Australia' can apply to goods which acquire their essential character in Australia. My dried fruit growers for years now have been competing with cheap and very much inferior dried fruit imports, particularly from Turkey. The member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has mentioned this also. He has a similar problem. The growers are greatly encouraged by the willingness of Australians to support the Australian dried fruits industry and want those consumers to have an unambiguous message about whether what they are buying contains Australian dried fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's proposal that is not clear because of the essential character test. Dried fruit is mostly consumed in value added products such as fruit cake. If we apply the essential character test to fruit cake, the operative noun is cake. So that is the emphasis when deciding its essential character. If it has Australian flour, it might wel be entitled to be labelled `Made in Australia'. Whether or not it has Turkish or Australian dried fruit may be irrelevant. But, if the essential character of that product is `fruitcake', the essential ingredient is fruit. I have been presented time after time with examples of major Australian fruit cake producers labelling their products `Made in Australia' when it is clear that the essential dried fruit ingredients are not Australian but come from Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply remind the minister that her defence that `Product of Australia' would cover all those problems my dried fruit growers have is not what Australian consumers would believe when they go to the market shelf and buy that fruit cake, clearly looking for a label `Made in Australia'. `Product of Australia' is an additional term which they find confusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will close by putting a case on behalf of citrus growers. The minister assured me and others, including the citrus growers in my electorate, during her visit that this legislation will clearly overcome their problem when imported Brazilian concentrate is used with an additive of Australian water to make reconstituted citrus juice. It will not be entitled to be called `Made in Australia' because the essential character of reconstituted citrus juice was achieved in Brazil. Simply evaporating the water in Brazil and adding Australian water does not allow it to be called `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not reassured by that. If this legislation is not amended along the lines suggested by the opposition, then my citrus growers will have added pain to what they have already been asked to bear with reduced tariffs, with no assistance at all in allowing them to cope with that and with trying to defend their cause in Australian courts&mdash;again an ongoing battle against imported Brazilian concentrate. I urge the minister to reconsider and adopt the coalition amendments which entrench once and for all what the generic term `Made in Australia' means to consumers&mdash;entirely made in Australia.</PARA>

The government's intention in introducing the scheme is to encourage Australian industry to label products which have their origin within Australia with the logo `Made in Australia.' It has given consumers a reliable means of identifying those products that are solely Australian and those that are made here from imported materials.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made a speech some time back about a tin of tomatoes. I was most indignant to find that although the label indicated it was purportedly from the Edgell company in Tasmania it turned out to be a product of the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian produce is some of the best in the world, and we are rightly very proud of that fact. We want to make sure that everybody knows where the product or the produce that they are buying is coming from. This is why the amendments have been presented. There are four situations arising from the bill. They include claims that goods are made in or are the product of Australia; that a step in the manufacture of the goods happened in Australia; that goods are designed in Australia; and representations in words or pictures likely to be regarded as claims that goods were made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme applies only to consumer goods as defined. It does not apply to goods intended to be exported. It does not cover representation on imported goods except where such goods make representation about being Australian. It only applies where a manufacturer or a supplier chooses to represent that Australia is the place of origin of the goods or is obliged by some other law to label goods with their place of origin, that place being Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, the bill provides that a corporation must not supply goods that carry an express and unambiguous representation that their place of origin is Australia, except as authorised. There are two authorised categories that have been developed. The first category includes `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia'. This means that Australia is the source of each major ingredient or component of the goods and that all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods occur in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second category is `Made in Australia'. This means that the goods acquire their essential character or qualities in Australia. The definition of this is where they were given their essential function, shape or appearance in Australia; the major processes which transformed them from their component parts into finished goods happened in Australia; or where goods are promoted as having certain characteristics or functions and goods were given those characteristics or functions in Australia. The last one would become more important in the technological age of today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These definitions were tested through the Trade Practices Act which prohibits the making of false or misleading representations about the place of origin. The proposed section 65 VF of the act will deal with these changes. There has been much discussion about this amendment and some concerns raised about the regional representation on labelling. I believe the basic intent of the act is supported by most people. The ACTU sums it up this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we want is a system which allows people to clearly choose between three categories: firstly, imported goods; secondly, goods manufactured in Australia; and thirdly, goods wholly made or produced in Australia from Australian components.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to encourage manufacturers to source their components in Australia on the basis that that is what the Australian consumer prefers. Hence there is a market advantage to the manufacturer who can meet this preference and this will create additional jobs for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>The ACTU was concerned at the confusion that might come from calling something `Manufactured in' compared with `Made in Australia'. The two main problems that I have had with the legislation are that the wording `Made in Australia' implies that it is all Australian, including the ingredients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument, and I now believe it to be a good argument, for importing some raw materials, for example, rubber. We do not produce any rubber in Australia but we import a lot. We use Australian workers, Australian technology and Australian design to make tyres from that rubber. They are for all intents and purposes `Made in Australia', but because there are some imported components they could not qualify for the title `Product of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms `Made in Australia' and `Manufactured in Australia' mean the same thing. The process of work and the jobs it provides are actually in Australia, despite the fact that the raw materials come from somewhere else. Australians can still buy jobs when they shop for the `Made in Australia' labels. If Australian consumers are seeking Australian made products they are achieving what they probably have in their mind, which is to support their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cocoa is another product which comes to mind. All Australian chocolates are made from imported cocoa.

It has had regional representations from groups within Tasmania that use a system of `Made in Tasmania' or `Product of Tasmania'. Of course, that will not be permitted under this bill. Tasmanian producers have put together a logo that defines their product and are now concerned that it will not be able to be used as the bill is currently worded. Producers are permitted to label goods `Proudly Tasmanian' instead of `Product of Tasmania'. We overcome the problem by changing a word.

The sugar is a product of Queensland, but the cocoa is imported and the vanilla is probably imported as well. Nearly all the ingredients of this fudge come from overseas or another state. All these things would have to be included on the label. For a small producer, such as the chap who makes this fudge, that is just not practical. If he can continue to put `Proudly Tasmanian' on his labels, he will achieve what he wants and we will achieve what we want in Tasmania. Cadbury's would be even less keen to have to state that its chocolate was Australian made but made from imported goods. The logo has been working as a good marketing tool for the regional group in Tasmania. A minor word change to the bill would have only a small impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will not take effect for 18 months, so businesses can use their supplies of labelling and be ready for the changes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies such as Cascade and Boags&mdash;two breweries in Tasmania&mdash;do not have a problem with the legislation as most of their materials now come from somewhere other than Tasmania. The bottles are made in Victoria, but the water is Tasmanian and some of the barley is Franklin barley. It is possible to identify products from a particular Australian region, but the label must include the `Product of Australia' or `Made in Australia' symbol if products are to be used in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enough flexibility in this legislation so as not to disadvantage regional marketing strategies. People want to go for regional areas. I believe that is very important and it is something which I have been promoting through my work and within Tasmania. In many areas of Australia we need to go that way so that regional areas get their own products up and their own identification. That helps them in many fields. For example, in the tourist field it identifies them as areas that produce a product of quality. </PARA>

We need to sell it to the public and make sure that the public understands the new concepts. We import a lot of things and we make a lot of things in Australia. We need to have a process whereby the public can believe, with confidence, that a product is made in Australia, by Australians, with Australian ideas. The public needs to understand that it is not a simple world any more. We are not always able to say any more that something is made in Australia from Australian produce. I think simplicity is required. Overall, these amendments will advantage all Australian consumers, who will now be able to discern where a product is really from.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has taken a long time to get the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 to this stage of debate. We started way back in the last quarter of last year. A lot of people around Australia are looking to the legislation to see what the government is actually doing in this regard and are taking a great deal of interest in it. A lot of speakers who have spoken in the second reading debate today have indicated that they actually go into the supermarkets and do a bit of shopping&mdash;as I do, with my wife, from time to time. Now there is an expectation among Australian people when they pick something up from the shelves in the supermarket. You used to have to consciously go along and look for the `Australian Made' label, but now you subconsciously go looking for that label.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is all about truth in labelling and accurate descriptions of Australianness in products with the label `Made in Australia' on them. The people of Australia have funded, through one form or another, the promotion of Australian-made goods. The taxpayers of Australia have underwritten that campaign. They have a reasonable expectation that they are in fact buying Australian-made goods. That is what this debate is all about. I do not think that there is a great deal of philosophical difference between the government and the opposition in this regard. We are both trying to achieve the same result, but I believe the opposition wants to go a little further in being very genuine and probably being a little purer in our definition of what Australianness is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill is attempting to introduce a new voluntary scheme to govern labelling on consumer goods that have Australian content by inserting a new division 1B into part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974. This debate primarily arises over the use and misuse of the term `Made in Australia'. This government has spent a great deal of money, on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia, on what has been a very successful advertising campaign to promote Australian-made products. It has now become an attractive selling device to use, as much as possible, the `Made in Australia' label. It is not just at the national level; it is also at a regional level. Manufacturers in my area of New South Wales like to identify their product as manufactured on the mid-north coast, in Taree or in Port Macquarie. It has become a great selling tool for manufacturers in Australia to be able to put that `Made in Australia' or `Australian Made' logo on their goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently there are no present requirements that define the terms to be used to describe products with Australian content. The present meaning of the term `Made in Australia' is as determined by the courts, which broadly encompasses the `essential character' test. It is at that point that the government and the opposition part company as far as their views are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 53 of the Trade Practices Act presently creates a specific offence for a firm to make a false or misleading representation concerning the place of origin of goods. As well, the Food Standards Code regulates country of origin labelling for food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill therefore attempts to deal with the issue of how to label and define the terms and conditions under which goods claiming varying amounts of Australian content can be described, the fact is that the government has not done justice to the people of Australia in giving consumers as many facts as possible in making purchasing decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In getting Australian consumers to focus not only on Australian products manufactured in Australia but also on manufactured from Australian produce, everybody that sits in this chamber and the other place is trying to generate more employment in this country&mdash;the central problem that this government faces and that this nation will face for some years to come. We are after the outcome of improving the situation of employment and unemployment. We can talk about value-adding and all these other things&mdash;this campaign to promote Australian made products has been successful. We want to take it a step further and make it completely truthful&mdash;truth in labelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that the bill will work via a two-tiered labelling system, known creatively as category A and category B. Category A goods are those that have Australian ingredients or components and all operations involved in the manufacture or production of goods occurring in Australia may be represented as `Produce' or `Product of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Category B goods are those that acquire their essential character or qualities in Australia. Under the government scheme, this more general category has been given the more specific term of `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would surely be far more appropriate for the government to move `Made in Australia' to category A as this is the term that Australians have come to know as representing the truest meaning of the word. The understanding held by most Australians of `Made in Australia' is that it is both grown and manufactured in Australia. To overcome the problem of category B, it is thus a wise and important move to introduce `Manufactured in Australia', which still deals with the essential character or qualities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we heard previously today, this decision by the coalition has widespread community support, and the government would do well to listen to some of the following survey results. For example, the Quadrant survey showed that 74 per cent of consumers believe products labelled `Made in Australia' should not contain imported ingredients, the CSIRO national nutrition survey of January 1994 showed that 98 per cent polled agreed that food should not be labelled `Australian Made' unless it was both grown and processed entirely within Australia, and the Coles survey of October 1993 showed that 89 per cent prefer to buy locally manufactured food products. With the government having spent $15-odd million on an extremely successful public education campaign, it is ridiculous for it to then turn around and say that the term `Made in Australia' is of less importance than `Product of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments put forward by the coalition attempt to clarify in the public mind what goods are produced in Australia while clearly distinguishing product/produce/made in Australia from goods that acquired their finished look only in Australia. In this respect, the manufactured in Australia label gives a truer representation of the history and the nature of the goods in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is arguing for the empowerment of the consumer. The consumer must be given the most information possible, the most accurate information possible and the least misleading information possible. That is the responsibility of the government. It is also the responsibility of the opposition in this House to ensure, to the best of our ability, that takes place because the consumers are the people of Australia that have elected not only the members on the opposition benches but also the members on the government benches. We all represent consumers. We need truth in labelling. The coalition believes it is important to make distinct the differences between domestically produced goods and those goods `finished off' in Australia. As yet, this has not been done by the government in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when Australia's future economic viability is in doubt or there is a question mark against it&mdash;as we heard in question time today&mdash;the issue of the origin of labelling is a serious one. Just about all countries around the world aim to promote the health of their domestic economy, and they actively support it. We experienced that last week with the financial weight that the Clinton administration is prepared to throw behind the dairy industry in attacking some of our major markets. Just about all countries around the world aim to promote the health of their domestic economy through the sale of home-grown/produced goods. Yet in Australia, we face a labelling dilemma. That is what we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In researching this bill it was interesting to look at the overseas experience of rules of origin and the making of the rules. Australia is neither the first nor will it be the last country to seek to promote the health of its domestic economy by means of country of origin labelling. Rules of origin, however, are very complex and it is important to differentiate as far as possible between the rules which apply at the international level and those which may be introduced at the domestic level. These issues can be further complicated when there is added to the equation a proposal that not only should the label on a product identify the country of origin but also the label should identify a region within that country. I know that the government proposes to move that amendment and I do not think that we will oppose it because it has become the vogue in my electorate, and I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your electorate also, that local manufacturers like to identify their region. With the development of RDOs under the current Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), I am sure that that will be furthered in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These considerations are sometimes taken one step further by those who promote the preference for local manufacturers over foreign owned manufacturers operating within the domestic market. As can be seen from the following list, in Germany there is no mandatory descriptors on labels. If `Made in Germany' is used it must not be misleading. The product must have `those characteristics or components of the product which constitute its value in the eyes of the public [that] are the result of German work'. We have just heard the statistics in those polling results of the expectations of Australian consumers on the meaning of the labelling `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Japan there are no mandatory descriptors on labels. If a label is applied, it must be accurate. The government guidelines say that the country of origin is where a substantial change of the goods takes place. In Canada, to claim Canadian origin the product must satisfy two tests: firstly, the last substantial transformation was performed in Canada resulting in a new and identifiable product; and, secondly, an assessment is made as to the amount of direct Canadian labour and materials as inputs. So there is a varying degree&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. So a number of different attitudes are being applied by overseas governments in their laws and regulations of labelling. It is important to note that everybody is in the same dilemma as us. We are facing up to competing in a deregulated world trading market on 1 July this year. It is not clean; it is corrupt. There is still an element of doubt as to the bona fides of a lot of the participants who signed GATT as to how that treaty will be adhered to. We have to strengthen our domestic market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, legislation has been piecemeal. This bill was introduced into the House about four or five months ago. Both state and Commonwealth legislation are developed on an ad hoc basis. There has been no uniform or comprehensive scheme in Australia. Since 1977 the problems associated with labelling have been highlighted in most quarters of the Australian business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are continuing today with an extremely inefficient system. In a Trade Practices Commission report it was suggested that the lack of uniformity is an admission that Australia is not a common market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The out-of-control nature of labelling in Australia is exemplified by the number of organisations, acts or bodies that have influence over labelling. In addition to the Trade Practices Act 1974, decisions about country of origin can be made by the National Food Authority, the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905, the Imported Food Control Act 1992, and the Export Control Act 1982. The states and the territories also have a complex network of legislation dealing with labelling requirements which vary significantly from state to state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this indicate to us? Where there is a proliferation of different, ad hoc, legislation trying to address the dilemma that we face concerning labelling in this country, it means that there is a great deal of pressure being exerted by consumer groups who have an expectation of a bit more truth in labelling. There is also a great deal of pressure and expectation coming from a lot of manufacturers. Those who are genuinely manufacturing Australian products from Australian produce want a little bit of protection. The extent of this pressure is evident from the government's approach to this particular piece of legislation. This country is in a dilemma because of all those acts having input into how the subject is dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this day and age where political parties and political organisations are poll driven, the statistics speak for themselves. It is blatantly obvious that consumers and the general public in this country want this government to be truthful about what Australianness means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also highlights another sad facet of Australian government today: as tariff barriers drop, low cost offshore producers are increasing rapidly in numbers in the Australian marketplace. The government has in place one of the most rigid labour markets in the western world. It is an absolute disgrace. We have a lopsided deregulation process. This government talks about being the great reforming government of this century. There has been no reform of the labour market. Local producers have been forced to market products on a quality rather than price basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The buy Australia campaign is, indeed, a direct result of Australian companies being unable to compete, due to the labour market restrictions that currently exist in Australia. It is a sad fact of life in Australia today that we so often hear people say, `Oh, I would love to buy Australian products, but most of the time I am simply forced to buy the cheaper produce'. In part, that is due to the very, very rigid and restrictive labour market that we suffer from in this country. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, for too many people today, due to this government's policies, the choice in the supermarket is simple: fill up the shopping trolley with the cheapest goods available. Our current labour market, our tight industrial relations laws, and our regressive business taxation system has taken the ability to buy Australian produced goods out of the hands of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we allow this bill to pass unamended the term `Made in Australia' becomes a second class, demeaning term and allows goods with essentially 100 per cent imported components to be labelled as `Made in Australia'. This view is shared by both the ACTU and the Australian Consumers Association. We cannot allow the government to hide its own industrial relations and labour market problems behind fuzzy labelling laws. It is time for labelling laws in Australia to be clarified and the coalition amendments will attempt to achieve this. The government cannot further confuse what should be an obvious step towards clarifying the history of a product in the interests of Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have been in this parliament I have noted the number of times when the ACTU has jumped in and hijacked the process of drafting, presenting and passing legislation in this country. We saw this happen last year with the industrial relations legislation. The ACTU has been involved in the drafting of health legislation in Australia. The ACTU does not support the government's position on this current legislation, but where is the ACTU today when this legislation is presented to the House of Representatives in the Commonwealth parliament?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the ACTU not speaking up on behalf of its members who are all consumers and who all work for companies that manufacture products from Australian produced goods? Where is Bill Kelty? Surely Bill Kelty can act as expediently as he did when he completely hijacked the industrial relations policy? We believe that the Prime Minister has only one hand on the lever in this country; the other hand is that of Bill Kelty. Where is Bill Kelty today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that 98 per cent of the people polled in the CSIRO national nutrition survey agreed that `Australian Made' should mean Australian made. It is about time that this Labor government starting telling the truth to the consumers and  taxpayers of Australia. For the last 10 to 12 years the government has got away with being untruthful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The desire to implement change in this part of the Trade Practices Act is a direct result of the desire of so many Australians of all walks of life to promote and buy Australian goods. Growing up as a child in the fifties, I really did not give much thought to all this as one rightly assumed at that time that almost all the goods and services offered for sale were either home grown or obtained from local producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has changed in the past 40 years. I still remember quite vividly growing up in Ballarat and having the baker and the milkman deliver their fresh wares by horse and cart.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Times have changed dramatically. Consumerism rules. Purchase or perish seems to be the catchcry of the large retail stores as they advertise ad nauseam on television screens across Australia in a frantic attempt to grab an even larger share of the consumer dollar. Gone forever are the backyard vegetable gardens. Local councils frown on us having fowls unless we are on the urban fringes. Bread and milk deliveries have virtually disappeared from the urban landscape. Our weekly quota of garbage bags has almost overwhelmed the available landfill in our many cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to identify what is really Australian is almost as hard as picking six numbers in Tattslotto.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large Australians have been captured and completely mesmerised by the two major food chains. We are now convinced of the worthiness of purchasing brand A or brand X by the amount of time that we see it on television screens, the size of the advertisements in the daily newspapers, or the cost of such articles especially when they are on special. Because of their enormous buying power and the indecent haste of many suppliers to be part of the Coles-Myer or Woolworths chains, the two large food chains now stock their shelves for profit. They do not really care where the goods are grown, produced or processed. This is especially so of the store generic brands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Trade Practices Act to establish a new labelling scheme for goods that make a claim to be of Australian origin. Shopping at the local supermarket and trying to purchase goods of Australian origin is currently complicated by the suppliers and marketers of overseas goods. In many cases the two major food chains aid in this deception by their acceptance of Australian symbols on these foreign goods in an attempt to influence Australians into thinking that these are the fair dinkum thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many supermarket aisles, the fair dinkum Australian product is not found on the top one or two shelves but is placed further down and away from easy viewing. As the minister stated in her second reading speech, consumers, at a time when they are genuinely conscious of the benefits of buying Australian, are really not confident that the labels stating or implying Australian origin can be totally relied on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How often have you gone to purchase a product with a label with an Australian connotation attached, expecting it to be Australian when, upon closer inspection, you find it was made in or imported from one of our neighbouring Asian countries? This new scheme will, first of all, set the terms and conditions for making a claim about the Australian content or nature of goods. Secondly, it will control the use of potentially misleading representations of Australia or Australiana on labels. Thirdly, it will require origin labels to be clearly legible and visible to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with four different types of representations commonly made on consumer goods. The first is express claims that goods were made in or are a product of Australia. The second is claims that a step in manufacture happened in Australia, such as `Assembled in Australia' or `Packaged in Australia'. The third is claims that goods were designed in Australia. Finally are representations in words or pictures likely to be regarded as claims that the goods were made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the most important aspect here is the use of terms to clearly identify fair dinkum Aussie goods. These terms are: `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia', and `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister stated in her second reading speech, the first two terms&mdash;`Product of Australia' and `Produce of Australia'&mdash;mean the same thing and are interchangeable. They simply mean that all the major components or ingredients came from Australia and that any processing which took place happened in Australia. This is the label for all-Australian goods. This meets the wish expressed by consumers to know which goods are made in Australia from Australian ingredients or components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The label `Made in Australia' means what it says, that the goods were made here. It also recognises that for many products we have to import some or all of the components but that Australian industry and Australian workers transform these components into a new product. In simple terms, these goods acquire their essential character or quality in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, being the diverse country that it is, parochialism is still alive and eager to have its say, especially when it comes to states competing against each other for market share. This concern over the whole issue of labelling is very evident in my state of Tasmania&mdash;the state with the clean, green image, the state that has probably done the most to ensure that its products can be readily and easily identified when it comes to consistent quality and standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am really concerned that my state's Liberal government and its relevant minister in this area, Dr Madill, have trotted out the hoary argument that states have not been consulted and that Tasmania and its excellent quality products will suffer as a result of this legislation. I can assure honourable members, Tasmanian producers and Tasmanians in general that consultations have been taking place, and have been taking place since November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal concern of Tasmanian producers was that the legislation would prevent them from continuing to be able to use the word `Tasmania' on the labels of their various goods. I am pleased to say that this concern has been noted by the minister, and in order to clarify this point she has introduced an amendment so that it will now be possible to add the name of a place after the authorised term, such as `Product of Australia&mdash;Tasmania' or `Made in Australia at Hobart'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has introduced a further amendment to make it clear that, when an authorised term is used, the label can also identify a particular process which has happened in a particular place, for instance, `Product of Australia&mdash;Brewed in Tasmania'. Of course, it will continue to be possible to label goods as `Tasmanian Cheese', `Proudly Tasmanian' or `Pate from Tasmania'. The only condition is that, together with these implied claims of origin, somewhere on the label the authorised term for which they qualify must also appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no restriction imposed by the legislation on the number or size of these representations. A product could be almost entirely covered with the word `Tasmania'. I have an example here of a label from a packet of Tasmanian brie, a superb example of the very fine foods produced in my state. I would like to read the label for the record to show that this bill can encompass the requirements of food producers, not only throughout my state of Tasmania, but throughout other regions of Australia as well.

This educational process is vital because there is a general misunderstanding in the community and on the part of most consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great interest to the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) when he spoke of a national Coles supermarket survey concerning the preference of shoppers for local Australian products. According to that survey, 71 per cent of those surveyed said that they would buy Australian even if the imported product was slightly better quality, while 57 per cent surveyed would buy local even if the import were 10 per cent less expensive. This sounds simple enough. Shoppers like to buy Australian as they are aware of the positive economic effects on job creation and the development of our manufacturing and rural sectors. This survey shows that Australians have faith in local products, so now it is up to retailers to highlight the importance of buying Australian, and for consumers to understand what is really 100 per cent dinky-di Australian. </PARA>

Once this bill is passed, discerning shoppers who wish to purchase orange and mango juice grown and made in Australia will need to look no further than a bottle or container with a label stating `Orange and Mango Juice&mdash;Product of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This educational process is vital as there is general misunderstanding on the part of consumers as to what the current terms really mean. We have to re-educate the consumers of Australia so that they realise that `Made in Australia' does not necessarily mean that goods manufactured here are largely from Australian components or ingredients. That sounds quite simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all the hoary arguments we have had dragged across the table about the cost of relabelling and whether the ACTU, the consumer groups or the housewives associations are for or against it are irrelevant. We are advantaging Australians by encouraging Australians to purchase what is made, grown and produced here. It is no good people saying they are not clear; `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia' is quite simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, in 12 months when I pick up an orange and mango juice it will have on the label either `Product of Australia' or `Made in Australia from 25 per cent Australian and 75 per cent imported fruit juice from Chile' or wherever else. I urge all members of this House to support the bill and I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to commend the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) for the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 because it is needed. Every speaker has indicated that. I also want to commend her for the consultation she undertook with different groups, particularly her visit to Mildura on the initiative of the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). I had my food processors, et cetera at that meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is also needed because of the fraudulent labelling that we see in this country at the present time, the confusion that exists because of the lack of precise criteria or definitions and also the laxity in policing even the type of labelling that is presently legal. Of course that problem will continue with any new legislation so there is and will continue to be that requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example I use a bottle similar to that of the previous speaker, the member for Franklin (Mr Quick). I bought mine in the canteen at lunch time. It is Spring Valley orange juice. Spring Valley is a Campbells company. I have the major Campbells processing factory in Australia in my electorate, but this juice is not actually made or bottled in Shepparton. The label states `Made in Australia from Australian and imported fruit juice'. I am not criticising Spring Valley or Campbells. Their labelling is better than that of many manufacturers, but it is inadequate and it is confusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of whether it is the government legislation or the government legislation with the opposition amendments that finally passes, obviously that type of labelling has to be improved. In particular, it has to be improved with fruit juice because of the difficulties the industry faces in being able to convey to the Australian public what is and what is not juice that really is, if you like, a product of Australia or juice from fruit that is grown in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been a long time coming. The states have been very slow to pass the complementary legislation to the federal legislation, which I remember we passed in federal parliament in the late 1970s, to allow the uniform packaging, labelling, food standards, et cetera that are a necessary basis for what is now being achieved. There have been two government working parties with recommendations. This legislation was introduced in March last year. It was referred to a House of Representatives committee, then to a Senate committee before the debate commenced in the House of Representatives in October. The legislation was then withdrawn. Now the bill is back again. Hopefully, it will pass both houses with due speed and with the opposition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been the subject of intense and extended lobbying. In fact, it has been a most interesting piece of legislation in that regard. The lobbying is not against the principle and purpose of the bill; it concerns whether the bill adequately represents or achieves its purpose. There has been a remarkable coalition which believes the legislation by itself is inadequate: the food producers or farmers; the food processors or manufacturers; the consumers; the CWA; and two groups that would generally be supportive of the government and that can apply pressure to government&mdash;some consumer organisations and the unions, including the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of my electorate is the irrigation area of northern Victoria, which is the major food processing area of Australia. Thirty per cent of dairy production in Australia comes from that area. When you take out milk used for city milk purposes, half the manufactured dairy products in Australia come from the area. Almost 100 per cent of the deciduous canned fruit comes from the area and a very clear majority of the processed tomatoes and tomato products comes from the area. There are 16 major food processing factories in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Working Nation document last year, this government recognised the special position of this area. The proposals in that document were the forerunner to the development of these RDOs or regional development organisations. Six million dollars was provided to assist the progress the area was making with regard to irrigation and drainage, and the quality of the water going into food processing factories and effluent out of those factories. Great progress is being made and tremendous productivity increase is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those food processors are united in their support for the opposition amendment. There was no need for it to have been the opposition's amendment; it could have been the government's. In particular, I refer to John Corboy, the Chairman of Directors of SPC, for his very outspoken role in drawing the attention of the Australian public to the weakness in the government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These food processors, the unionists who work in those factories and the farmers who supply the commodities for those factories all suffer from corrupt processed food imports&mdash;that is, dumped product being sold at less than a fair price. A lot of that product is still coming into Australia because to stop it you have to prove not only that the dumping takes place but that it is causing material damage. It is very hard for that to be achieved under the criteria introduced by this government. All of these industry people urgently need more honest and accurate labelling so they will have the positive ability to counter some of these dumped imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some have been for the government legislation as it is: the grocery manufacturers association, some non-food manufacturers, because it applies to them as well, the confectionery manufacturers association and supermarkets. No-one disagrees with the terminology `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia', because they mean all Australian&mdash;grown, processed, packaged. The disagreement, as many speakers have indicated, is over `Made in Australia'. The government legislation confirms the earlier court decision that, provided a product gains its essential character in Australia, it can be labelled `Made in Australia' even if all of the ingredients, all of the raw materials, have been imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say, as do all of these groups that I have mentioned and as the opinion polls reflect, that `Made in Australia' should mean what it says. In other words, the standard and sensible English usage should be that `Made in Australia' means just that: the same as product or produce of Australia, grown in Australia, processed in Australia and packaged in Australia. That is also supported by the government's own advertising campaign over many years and the logos for Australian made. All of the logical, sensible argument supports the amendment to make `Made in Australia' mean what it says; that is, the same as `Product/Produce of Australia'. A new category termed `Manufactured in Australia' would apply where goods are processed in Australia from imported ingredients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Why then, when it is so strongly supported, is the government sticking to what is obviously a less than sensible and less than fair position? There is no need for the government to stick to the decision taken by the courts because that happened many years ago. This parliament is here to legislate whenever court decisions or others are found to be inadequate, and that one clearly is inadequate. It is no defence to say, `There is a cost to changing the labels,' because there will be an 18-month grace period. Anyone who goes through a food processing factory where exports are undertaken will see a great number of different labels for those different export markets or sometimes even for special markets in Australia. Changing a label is nothing new to these people and is no great expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where all of the ingredients are imported, the argument has been that it is unfair on manufacturers. The chocolate confectionery manufacturers are used as the prime example. However, if you are to maintain the credibility of `Made in Australia', you should not have any exceptions. Where chocolate is made in Australia from imported ingredients, with our amendments those Australian chocolate manufacturers still have a great advantage over fully imported chocolate manufacturers; that is, they can put on their label `Manufactured in Australia'. In my view, the fact that Australia is still written on the label gives them exactly the same advantage over the fully imported chocolate without destroying the credibility of `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also said that there are problems with variable imported components. The Grocery Manufacturers of Australia was the main proponent of this argument. For example, you may have variable percentages of all Australian product, but there may be a drought or shortfall and some of the ingredients have to be imported for a short time. This then creates problems. I acknowledge that this has some substance but, if you move away from the integrity of the labels `Product of Australia', `Produce of Australia' and `Made in Australia' all being the same, in my view you have lost a major element of the advantage of having any of the legislation that we have at present. For those who are mixing their ingredients, they can still use the label `Manufactured in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that we could run into problems with our food products with the Codex. I happen to have done some homework on what other countries do, and I can assure honourable members that there is no other country in any position to point the finger at us on that point. When it comes to non-food manufacturers, hopefully, if they are very close to 100 per cent Australian, this will encourage them to be completely Australian. Once again, no other country is in any position to point the finger at Australia. One example I was made aware of recently is that of the United States, which has just tightened its definition of `Made in the United States' in regard to cars because of the arguments it is having in regard to transplants from Japan versus the three US manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The supermarkets have also been opposed to the opposition amendments. One can understand why they are opposed to them, but that is no reason for supporting the supermarkets. They have made dramatic use of importing generic or house brand processed food and putting their own house brand on it, sourcing it quite often on a dumped basis from another country and still purporting to be supporters of Australia. From my experience of processed food in my area, the supermarket chains are not supporters of Australian processed products. They are happy to bring them in, especially when they are subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, over the last couple of years, when successful dumping action was taken against imported peaches from China and Spain and imported tomato products from other countries, supermarkets were stopped from bringing in these dumped products and suddenly promoted a buy Australian campaign. They did not do it voluntarily; they did it because they were forced to. Once again, you could see a better presentation of SPC and Ardmona peaches or Rosella tomato products on the supermarket shelves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is genuine in what it is trying to achieve&mdash;that is, to tighten up and correct the situation&mdash;then who is putting the pressure on the government to stop it from going along with what its own unions and consumer organisations want? I would have thought that the Minister for Consumer Affairs, if she is representing consumers, would have been listening very closely and following what the consumers were saying. If the government is not prepared to accept commonsense, there must be some almighty pressure being put on them. As we have indicated, the pressure is not coming from the unions or the consumers. It certainly cannot be international pressure. It certainly cannot be coming from the majority of food processors in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are the supermarkets applying pressure? Is pressure being applied from some individual companies that would see themselves disadvantaged, companies that have been good supporters of the government over the last few years? That is the big unanswered question in this whole debate. When the whole logic of the arguments for sensible, credible truth in advertising labelling legislation is analysed, the government has no open, logical reason to oppose those amendments. If that is the case, whom is the government listening to? Who is putting the pressure on the government to prevent it from doing basically what everybody in Australia wants it to do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite the minister in her reply, and speakers for the government in their remarks, to indicate whether the pressure is coming from the supermarket chains or some of the big companies. It would be better and easier for the government, and better for Australia, if the opposition amendments were accepted. I am sure that the opposition would be very happy if the government were to accept, even at this late stage, that these proposed amendments are sensible and put them forward as its own. Then we can have genuine, sensible and credible `Made in Australia' and `Product of Australia' labels, promoting Australian labelling for the benefit of everybody in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) for her patience and perseverance in the task of bringing the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill through to what will hopefully be its final conclusion at some time in the near future. The funny thing about this bill&mdash;I have noted it from earlier speakers today&mdash;is that it was designed to simplify and make more operable a system of labelling in this country but, like many tasks designed to simplify, when you look into the detail, it is very complex and very difficult to do so in a way that will satisfy all concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 is to insert a new division into the Trade Practices Act 1974 to deal with the method of labelling goods which are claimed to be made, manufactured, packed or designed in Australia. The bill focuses on representations made about Australian origin on consumer goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History has shown that labelling in Australia is piecemeal, complex, goes across state and Commonwealth legislation, and can at best be described as ad hoc. As early as 1977, a report by the Trade Practices Commission on packaging and labelling laws in Australia was particularly scathing about the lack of uniformity in the area, commenting that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No system of State legislative implementation will succeed in any long term, reasonably efficient sense . . . If Australia cannot obtain packaging and labelling, and contents legislation of a uniform nature, it is an admission that Australia is not a common market . . . The nature of Australian production runs is problem enough . . . To subdivide these runs into runs for each individual State because of varying . . . requirements is . . . the height of folly in any system of rational economic planning.</PARA>
<PARA>Since that time there have been improvements, but the logical conclusion of that report is at least part of the purpose for which we are here today. After almost two years of consultation, this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 23 March 1994. Soon afterwards, it was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for scrutiny. This was the first such referral of a bill to this committee, and only the third such referral to any standing committee of the House since federation. That committee deliberated and recommended only one amendment, which the government accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading of the bill was subsequently allocated to 28 June. However, at the request of the opposition shadow spokesperson at that time, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which deliberated and produced a report. Now, almost 12 months since the start of the process within the chamber, we are hopefully nearing the conclusion of the second reading debate in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this bill necessary? Some of the current descriptions which can be used for labelling which has an intent relating to Australia are: `Made in Australia', `Australian made', `Manufactured in Australia', `Product of Australia', `Produce of Australia', `Produced in Australia', `Processed in Australia', `Packaged in Australia', `Assembled in Australia', `Servicing Australia' and `Australian made from local and imported ingredients'. It is easy to be confused, and consumers have become cynical about the meaning of the many and varied available labels. This impacts on public awareness, understanding and acceptance of the labelling system, and therefore on the success of the system as a whole. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I go into the supermarket on the few occasions on which I get dragooned by my wife to assist&mdash;normally helping to mind the kids&mdash;I am totally confused by the system. I have learnt more about it in researching this bill than I ever learnt before and, in some respects, I am still none the wiser. The simplicity of the proposed system has its disadvantages, which other speakers have alluded to and which I will talk about later. But its advantages in getting together a system which will be understood outweigh its disadvantages and, in that respect, the key element is simplicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to Australia of the existing labelling program is quite significant. A study done some time ago by the Printing and Allied Trade Employers' Federation of Australia suggested that the Australian printing, packaging and labelling industry was losing somewhere in the region of $50 million every year as a result of poor, misleading or non-existent country of origin information. The federation believes that that problem has cost the wider Australian community in the region of $500 million. That translates to something like 500 jobs for the printing and packing industry alone, and no doubt the cost elsewhere is much more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not try to read through the detail of the proposals contained in the bill because, as is the case with much amending legislation, its wording is complex. On 8 October 1993, the minister made a speech at the Opera House which gives a simple version of the key components of the bill. With regard to the essentials of the scheme, the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If all its major components originate in Australia and any processing has been done in Australia, a product can be labelled "Product of Australia" or "Produce of Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a product has gained its essential character in Australia&mdash;even if it contains some imported materials&mdash;it can be labelled "Made in Australia". On this point, some people argue that it should be compulsory to provide extra information about the origin of ingredients of food. The National Food Authority (which has the responsibility for food labelling) may well agree. My system (which is my responsibility) sets the baseline. If the NFA wishes to build on this baseline, it has the power to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a product doesn't meet the tests for these higher order labels but some part of its processing has taken place in Australia, it can be labelled with terms such as "Assembled", "Bottled" or any other term which describes the process so that the Australian contribution to the product can be identified. These terms will have to be accompanied by information on where components come from, whether they're Australian or imported. "Designed in Australia", a term which describes a step before production, will only be allowed in conjunction with information on where the product was made, assembled, sewn, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General wording such as "manufactured" or "produced in Australia" will not be permitted.</PARA>
<PARA>The essence of the bill is to attempt to get to a question of truth in labelling and to ensure a situation where people can see what appears on a label and understand what it means, versus the great confusion that occurs at the moment. Many examples have been given today of the range of deceptive, misleading labels that appear on some products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of why this legislation is necessary also goes to the issue of the public's known preference for Australian made products. The information on that issue is very clear and has been made available in this House in the form of the presentation of a number of petitions, private members bills, grievance debates and adjournment debates. It is a matter of obvious concern within the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public surveys highlight the fact that this is an important national issue in the context of the conduct of the economy. The 5 March 1993 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">B&amp;T</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Figures from the Advance Australia Foundation claim 66% of Australians will buy the Australian variety of a product whenever possible, with another 14% "mostly" buying home-made. Varying estimates suggest the majority of Australians will pay a premium of perhaps 10% to buy products made in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National grocery chain, Coles Supermarkets, has been sufficiently lobbied by customers to incorporate signage instore indicating which products are Australian made. A survey conducted shortly before the chain launched its "Australian Made" campaign found 60% of respondents said they would pay up to 10% more for Australian made goods of the same quality as a competing import, and 69% would still buy Australian products even if the quality of the imported product was slightly better.</PARA>
<PARA>Norm Spencer, Executive Director of the Australian Made Foundation, was quoted in the article as stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People here trust Australian foods more than any other country's . . . They realise that it's the freshest and best and it comes under health regulations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent Advance Australia Foundation research found 80% of Australians will buy Australian made products most of the time. The remaining void of 20% is due to a lack of Australian products in some categories such as cars and electronics, as well as "snob value&mdash;particularly with clothing and that sort of thing", according to Spencer. A lack of education, apathy and the ingrained, long-term purchasing habits of some consumers also contributes.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate those involved in the Australian Made Foundation for their part in the development of public awareness on this issue. I think they have gone done a great job. I have met Mr Spencer at functions within my electorate at which he has been leading the charge on this issue, and I think he is doing a great job for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits to Australia are obvious to all of us but I will go through them again to make sure that we get them on the public record. I want to firstly address import replacement. Obviously, if we can switch people from buying foreign made goods to Australian made goods, we will be in a position where imports will be replaced. That will assist in foreign debt and in the productivity of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of export enhancement. It is often said that local manufacturers need a large and stable presence in the domestic market in order to allow them to build and develop export potential. By selling more products within Australia, they have put themselves in a situation where they can develop that domestic base and hopefully move on from there to improve export performance. Obviously, the flow-on from all of that is employment enhancement. The more Australian products we buy in our supermarkets and stores, the more jobs there will be for Australian workers right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the food industry, the national grocery market accounts for $25 billion per year. According to the ACTU, one in eight jobs depends either directly or indirectly on the food industry. Other evidence suggests that in the area of food processing, for example, for every person employed directly there are another five jobs created. This brings the total number of jobs dependent on these industries to around one million. Hopefully, through the use of this legislation, we can improve on what is obviously a very important section of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has belatedly proposed three amendments of its own, which the government has rejected. Two of the amendments directly contradict the position taken by Senator Vanstone at the Senate committee inquiry into the bill. Among other things, the opposition proposed that the term `Made in Australia' be used only for goods produced in Australia from all Australian ingredients. Those goods that gained their essential character here but contained some imported components would be labelled `Manufactured in Australia'. The opposition amendments have already resulted in a sustained campaign being launched against them by industry groups facing significant job losses if they ever became law. For instance, the Confectionery Manufacturers Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The logic of adopting non-dictionary definitions to separate the meaning of "Made" from "Manufactured" is mind numbing. The CMA intends to continue its campaign to pressure the Coalition to support the Government's Bill as it stands.</PARA>
<PARA>The Advance Australia Foundation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . continuing concern over the Democrats' and Coalition's proposed amendments to the country of origin bill . . . The proposed changes would effectively undermine a great success story.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the opposition's proposal, goods with some imported components could continue to carry the Australian made logo, but these same goods would be in breach of the act if they were also labelled `Made in Australia'. Even the research commissioned and much quoted by the coalition does not support its amendments. For instance, in July 1994, Quadrant Research in a study commissioned by SPC found that, even for food, fewer than half of those questioned agreed with the coalition's stance that `Made in Australia' means made from 100 per cent Australian ingredients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my learned colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) would say, there are statistics and there are statistics, but it highlights the fact that, although there is broad support within the chamber for the bill, there is a concern that the bill does not go far enough. I share some of those concerns but I do not share the view that there is an obvious and easy answer to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the bill as it stands gives us an opportunity to get some national uniform legislation in place. It gives us an opportunity to get a simplified system that is perhaps to some too simple, but I think that simplicity is its key. It gives it the capacity to be understood widely. The government will support it with a public education campaign. The country can hopefully start to cash in on those high recognition rates for the question of Australian made, and we can have a situation where people are able to easily follow through on their positions regarding Australian made products because they will understand the way it will assist them. Hopefully, people will also be able to avoid those interminable times that I know I have in the supermarket with my wife and family trying to work out what on earth I am really buying. I commend the bill to the House. I urge it to be passed swiftly and wish it all the very best in the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit to being a little surprised that the coalition has decided to seek to amend the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994, as presented by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh). It is not that I oppose the amendments but, with all respect to opposition members, I think it is fair to say that, during the deliberations on the bill by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, coalition members certainly did not express a passionate desire to produce a more prescriptive bill than the one proposed by the minister. I was looking for a bit of support but I could not find much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I originally expected that the influence of members of the National Party would have been enough to coax coalition committee members to flag the tightening of the `Made in Australia' clause in the legislation. Unless my memory eludes me, it was not forthcoming. I suppose it needs to be pointed out that the industry committee's deliberations were constrained by time and, had time been available, possible amendments to the legislation would more than likely have emerged. Nevertheless, it now appears that Senator Boswell and those who prodded him won the debate in the party, as the opposition is now totally committed to tightening the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also say that it is rather refreshing to see the coalition wholeheartedly supporting the ACTU's position on the legislation. The ACTU argues that the second proposed category in the bill&mdash;that is `Made in Australia'&mdash;should be relocated in a `Product of Australia' category, and that goods which only acquire their essential character in Australia should be relocated in a `Manufactured in Australia' category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all a bit confusing because, just when the coalition elects that self-proclaimed anti-union man, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as leader of the party, members of the coalition rise in this House to declare their support for the ACTU's position on the origin labelling bill. I note that, during the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) on the second reading debate last October, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) interjected, claiming that the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, had been in the House to `support ours'&mdash;that is, the coalition's amendments. The facts are that the ACTU and the Food Policy Alliance took a strong position on the origin labelling bill well before the coalition arrived at its present position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Leader of the National Party or anyone else in the coalition to claim that they led the charge on this legislation does not, from where I sit, appear to be in accordance with the facts. The Leader of the National Party, all puffed up with nationalistic pride, went on to proclaim the `integrity of "Made in Australia"'. Sadly, it is the obsessive and fundamentalist free trade policies which the likes of the Leader of the National Party adhere to which have done so much damage to Australian industry. If honourable members are arguing that, in the absence of a comprehensive industry policy, our origin labelling legislation is the panacea for Australian industry, they must be kidding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A small number of dissenters aside, there is nothing in government or coalition policy which would convince an observer that either party cares about who owns Australian industry, where our goods come from or what kind of conditions imported goods are made under. The Treasurer (Mr Willis), like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), tells us that when we are fully restructured&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;the import splurge that afflicts our economy will come to an end. I have been hearing this for a long time and I have been here for only three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the interest in Australian industry proclaimed by some members flies in the face of the policies they support. I suspect that the amendments proposed by the coalition are essentially a product of the National Party's instinctive desire to protect its constituency&mdash;something historically it has a soft interventionist spot for. The speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) expressed these very sentiments. Not surprisingly, the honourable member tended to focus on the food industry and on peanuts in particular, which are big in his region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise an important issue which I have raised in this House before. I refer to the drought which is affecting north central Victoria. Whilst many areas of Australia have in fact received substantial rainfalls over the past two weeks, the area of north central Victoria is still racked with drought. The rainfall in Bendigo and that district has been recorded for 131 years and the city and its environs have achieved an annual average of 553 millimetres over that time. I quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of 31 December 1994:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1994's total was a piddling 277 mm&mdash;half the average.</PARA>
<PARA>There are pockets of land and many areas surrounding Bendigo that have received much less rainfall. In fact, we have had 12 millimetres or less of rainfall since June 1994. I did make an appeal in October in this House to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) to send the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee down to the north central Victorian area to have a look at the effects of the drought and the oncoming impact that drought is going to have on that part of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all fairness to the minister, he did send that advisory committee down but it visited one area. It visited the area of Swan Hill, which is located on the Murray River and of course comes under the influence of the irrigation areas. I would have thought it would have been more appropriate for that advisory committee to have done a surveillance over a much broader part of the north central Victorian area and to have undertaken careful studies of the rainfall and exactly what has happened to north central Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended a drought meeting recently at Redesdale and was impressed by the professionalism of the people from the Victorian Department of Agriculture and other government departments from the state who provided the farming community with some very valuable advice on how to contend with the drought conditions which they are suffering. But the bottom line of it all was that there is no substitute for water. That was precisely the message that they left the farmers with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the latest rain has brought little relief for the area and I appeal now to the minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), who is a kindly soul, to take up this matter with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It is absolutely vital that we receive a further visit by the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee so it can have a closer look at the drought conditions that are being experienced by farmers in that north central Victorian area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government in Victoria has helped to the limit of its financial capacity but the federal assistance is still very much required. The exceptional circumstances provision needs to be brought into play. The area of north central Victoria has had three bad years in succession. This year it has been too dry, last year it was overtaken by a mice plague, and the previous season to that the conditions were too wet and most of the crops suffered as a result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to acquaint the House with the recent passing of a great Australian of German descent and a personal friend, Fritz Otto Fischer, on 15 January this year. I had known Fritz Fischer for some 20 years through an association with the German Saturday School. But it was not until my election to federal parliament in March 1983 that I became aware of the tremendous community work that Fritz Fischer had carried out within the Illawarra over many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a founding member of the German Saturday School Association, Wollongong-Illawarra, in 1962. He maintained that interest throughout his life and served many terms as president. In his community work, Fritz provided strong leadership to the German speaking community. Through his dedicated efforts it has been possible to provide, over a difficult period of time, lessons in the German language and culture in the two Saturday schools of Wollongong and Oak Flats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fritz Fischer's driving force and organisational talents were instrumental in ensuring the construction of a club house for the German Air Rifle Club, which is now a valued asset not only for its members but for the community. Membership of the air rifle club is open to all people. It plays a tremendous community role in my area and enables people from various backgrounds to meet in a friendly, informal fashion. I am pleased that I am a member of this club.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fritz Fischer was also a member of The Bridge, the umbrella organisation of German speaking associations in Australia. In fact, if I had to describe Fritz Fischer's work in the community it would be one of bridge building between the German speaking community and other communities. As well as all this, he was a contributor to the German language paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A less well-known aspect of his work was his role as a social worker. Whenever people from the German speaking community had a problem, it was to Fritz Fischer they turned for help in understanding government departments or filling out forms. I have lost count of the number of times I received telephone calls from him with questions about departments, or the number of people he referred to me. Usually when German speaking people came to see me they were accompanied by Fritz Fischer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fritz worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for German speaking people. He played a unique role in assisting them to settle here in Australia. His commitment to Australia was total. He contributed significantly to making society better for all Australians. This he did with no thought of personal reward or gain. His aim was always to bring understanding between the German speaking people and locally born Australians. Some years ago, Fritz Fischer organised a reunion of people who travelled to Australia on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shaubryn</EMPHASIS>. His tireless work was well known outside of the Illawarra, especially among the German speaking community of New South Wales and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 I nominated Fritz for an award in the Order of Australia and was delighted when he received that award, of which he was so justifiably proud. I regarded the award as honouring not only Fritz but also the Illawarra born German community. Fritz's award in the Order of Australia complemented the Cross of the Order of Merit extended to him by the Federal Republic of Germany for his work with German speaking people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He arrived in Australia in February 1958 and was naturalised in April 1993. He was born in Germany some 80 years ago. The overflowing numbers at his service were, I believe, testament to the work that he had done in the Illawarra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear much about relationships today, and they are often described as partnerships. I can say that Fritz and his wife, Lily, were partners in the truest sense of the word. To Lily and their children and spouses&mdash;Fritz Junior, Hans, Peter, Manfred and Elizabeth&mdash;I extend my condolences and the condolences of this House. Fritz Fischer will be missed in the Illawarra, but we have all been enriched by coming in contact with him during his long and fruitful life. </PARA>

They will obviously go down in history as the swan song of the honourable member for Bass. She will certainly be replaced by a Liberal member at the next election, when we are returned to office. People have had a gutful of the Labor Party after the last 12 years and they are desperate for change. Given the changes in the coalition leadership over the last few days, we believe that at the next election we will strongly receive the support of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I organised the Fisher electorate essay competition once again. Two students visited to Canberra but, owing to the government's legislative program, I was unable to read the winning essays into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> while the students were in the gallery. I would like therefore to read the two winning essays into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a tremendous number of entries from right across the electorate of Fisher. There was a junior section and a senior section. The senior section winner was Christopher Bingham of Caboolture State High School. He wrote on that very topical issue in Australian society, the family. The essay reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To prevent personal breakdown, first we must prevent family breakdown".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirty years ago the dominant family form was the nuclear family; Mother, Father and children, created in marriage. However, many changes have occurred in society which have drastically altered this picture. Changes in religious and social beliefs have augmented the family unit to include such circumstances as de facto relationships, single parent families and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone would claim to know the meaning of family. The law labels it the "natural and fundamental unit in our society", but the shifts in social values concerning the family unit seem to have diminished its importance. Recently there has been, particularly in countries like the United States, a call for the return of traditional family values. Nevertheless there are many factors working against this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the nineteen fifties and sixties the importance of the extended family has declined. It was common for families of that era to live within close proximity, thus individuals often had the support of the extended family during difficult periods. Now, due to the spread of population, this situation is unusual, often meaning that individual family members are left with little or no support and guidance.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no prerequisite for becoming a parent. Many couples find themselves unprepared, not only for the commitment of marriage but also the demands of parenthood. This, coupled with society's attitudes to marriage and in particular the sacrosanctity of the vows which bind it, often lead to what is becoming the plight of the nineties&mdash;divorce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With divorce and separation fast becoming the norm for the modern family, clearly the expectation for a married couple to "love and care for each other from this day forth", has almost vanished. This kind of negativity towards marriage and its obligations can have damaging effects, not only upon the couple, but likewise upon the children and their attitudes towards society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problems of the family do not lie solely with the parents; often children contribute to the breakdown of the family unit. Many couples are simply unprepared for the emotional and financial strain of a family.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As children grow older, other external forces begin to impact upon their lives&mdash;the biggest being peer pressure. Whilst it can have both a positive or negative influence, peer pressure has become tainted with its usage as an excuse for difficult children. Yet the problem is very real, so much so that it can often lead children and families into difficult and dangerous situations. A greater understanding of this problem would assist in lessening its more damaging aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without doubt, the problems facing the modern family are as intricate as any in society. The family is unique; however, it is not an area in which the law and Government can interfere greatly, nor attempt to regulate. In fact, endeavouring to do so merely makes things worse. Only the changing of social attitudes and beliefs concerning the family and its role can lead to the resolution of these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prevention of family breakdown would ultimately lead to the lessening of individual dilemmas. Perhaps from there a return to a safer, more prosperous society would be possible.</PARA>
<PARA>The junior section was won by a student from Nanango. There is not enough time left tonight for me to read the essay into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but the topic is racism. I certainly intend to read this essay into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should encourage our young people to understand more about our parliament. I must say that I was impressed with the public spirited and thoughtful approach that went into the essays by so many students from the electorate of Fisher. I certainly would like to congratulate each person who entered, particularly the winners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recently read some comments by one of our former colleagues, Steve Dubois, about the references to him in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS>, the political reminiscences of another former parliamentary colleague, former Senator Graham Richardson. Steve Dubois referred to the two references to him, both of which he claims are wrong. I can only claim three quarters of that score; of the four references to me, three are wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The references to me do not involve matters of great moment. I have not sought to be at the centre of power games around this place. Nor have I been party to some of the quite fascinating factional and personal intrigues in our political community. I simply know of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference to me which is correct states that I am one of only two New South Wales Labor members of parliament who have identified with the Centre Left faction in our caucus. That is true. Had I sought to use the factional arrangements of the Labor Party to advance my own political interests, I would not have become a member of the Centre faction. It is the Right and the Left which dominate the politics of Labor in my own state of New South Wales. Any other factional allegiance in New South Wales is largely irrelevant to the mainstream of our state Labor politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the references to me which is wrong but which is of no consequence is the suggestion that I went on to become a minister at the 1987 elections. In fact, I became a minister in September 1988 to fill a casual vacancy in the ministry following the appointment of Bill Hayden as Governor-General. The second reference to me which is wrong is the claim that when I stood for election to the ministry following Labor's win in 1983, I received only one vote out of 110. In fact, I received 29 votes from the 106 people who voted. That was not a bad result considering the fact that in the final negotiations to formulate a cross-factional ticket the previous day, the Right won one more place; and I was the one who was dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances were that caucus had decided that the ministry would consist of 27 members. The four leaders were elected unopposed. Thirty members nominated for the remaining 23 positions. As expected, those who were included in the cross-factional negotiated ticket were elected. I was not one of them. However, of the seven members who were not elected, I received the second highest number of primary votes&mdash;29&mdash;not the one vote claimed by Mr Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reference to me which is wrong is very peculiar because it depends on the accuracy of the previous claim, which was in error. The third incorrect claim was that I had left Paul Keating out of the 23 candidates I voted for. Mr Richardson claimed that those he referred to as our scrutineers examined all of the votes and, on the assumption that I was the one who voted for myself, they identified that I had dropped Paul Keating from my list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Richardson's claim is simply wrong. My No. 2 vote went to Paul Keating. The first 23 votes by any voter were of equal value; they were all primary votes. I did not give myself my No. 1 vote. I would be quite happy for Mr Richardson, if he wishes, to see my diary entry following that caucus meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those at the meeting, 106 voted for the ministry. Even if I had not voted for Paul Keating, it would have been impossible to identify my voting paper from the one which recorded a vote for me; because 29 of them did. Of the 106 who voted for the ministry, Paul Keating topped the list, receiving 105 primary votes. Clearly, someone did not vote for him. It was not me. Unlike Mr Richardson, I would be prepared to wager that Paul Keating knows who it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that Graham Richardson meant no malice by his incorrect assertions; nor would I expect him to. I am surprised, however, that he appears to have depended on people he identifies as his scrutineers to advise him on matters which are so easy to refute. The misrepresentations are of no particular concern. I make this statement simply in the interests of historic accuracy. No-one, including our Prime Minister, can claim that I have ever been less than honest in declaring how my vote would be cast in any ballot. That may not have always been politically astute, but I have always been able to sleep with a clear political conscience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mistake by Graham Richardson clearly reflects a breakdown in his memory. It would have been foolish in the extreme to deliberately make a statement which so easily could be refuted. The official records of caucus minutes exist. Some members and senators have retained their own copies. I am surprised that Graham Richardson appears not to have been one of those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed that Mr Richardson chose to use this mistake of fact to reflect on my personal judgment and whether I saw Paul Keating as a person worthy of inclusion in a federal Labor ministry. I have never thought otherwise. Paul Keating is one of Australia's most outstanding political figures. I am pleased he is on our side. Let me emphasise that my comments are not meant to detract from or diminish the interest in that store of reminiscences and political observations to which Graham Richardson has given the title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Whatever it takes</EMPHASIS>. If you have not read it, you should read it, and you will enjoy it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Australia Day my wife and I had the pleasure of visiting Amaroo Lodge in Whyalla. It was quite a delight, particularly on that day as the lodge received an award in recognition of its service to the community. Amaroo Lodge is a respite and rest care home in Whyalla. It calls itself the first of its kind in Australia and is unique because of its home away from home philosophy. It is not a nursing home; it cannot deliver medical services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amaroo Lodge is a place where aged or disabled people can live quite independently, with support if needed. It also offers respite care, which gives carers a break from time to time. It encourages its residents to participate in running daily activities and this helps to develop a positive approach. Meals are served at mutually convenient times. Visitors are welcome at all hours and can join residents for meals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lodge is run by the Whyalla branch of Disabled Peoples International. The management committee includes Martin Hancock, Bill McIlwaine, Ken Wells and Colleen Pedler, and they do a very fine job. Currently, the lodge is leased from the Whyalla Senior Citizens Association for about $25,000. Amaroo Lodge is a non-profit organisation run entirely by volunteers. There is no entrance or admission fee. Access to accommodation is based on need, not ability to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lodge leases its building from the Whyalla Senior Citizens Association and one of its aims for the future is to buy the building. This could be done either through a one-off payment from the government or an interest free loan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lodge would also like to improve the state of the building, which was formerly a nursing home but which has been disused for some time. The lodge would also like to employ more staff. I acknowledge the 40 volunteers, two of whom I met the other day&mdash;Judith Peicy and Jeane Peters. The lodge has been operating for about 14 months and has been filling a very important need in the Whyalla community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whyalla is one of those regional locations where people have difficulty in finding beds for their aged or disabled family members. Waiting lists are very long and families often have to go outside the town to find accommodation in other regional cities. This is unfortunate because it makes it so much harder for the families to visit and can make entering care accommodation much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because care accommodation is hard to find, many families care for their aged or disabled family members at home. This places extra strain and responsibilities on the family. Amaroo Lodge can provide temporary care when the family takes a break. The lodge currently is looking after 16 permanent residents and estimates that it has a capacity for 24 permanent residents and four respite people. I am extremely proud of Amaroo Lodge and the work it is carrying out in Whyalla. I have already assisted the lodge with a funding application and will continue to assist it because I think it is an extremely worthwhile venture for the government and community to support. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect to determine the plan following the planned review by the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) of the 900 MHz Band Plan in 1995-96.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, in the United States CDMA will utilise reclaimed AMPS radiofrequency spectrum, that is, AMPS operators will expand the capacity of their networks by withdrawing analogue AMPS channels and using them for CDMA. It is expected that manufacturers will market dual-mode terminals that will operate on either analogue AMPS or CDMA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's decision in December 1992 to phase out AMPS services by the year 2000 was an outcome of its November 1990 decision to adopt recommendations contained in AUSTEL's May 1990 report on public mobile services about the introduction of competition in the mobile market. Whereas digital GSM technology could sustain three or more competitors, each operating its own network, AMPS could sustain two competing networks at most. The Government came to the view that effective competition in digital mobile services would not develop without a phased withdrawal of AMPS services, which would also enable reallocation of the relevant radiofrequency spectrum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) From June 1965 to December 1972, 63,790 national servicemen served in the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) It is not possible to accurately provide the information in the format requested without extensive use of limited manpower resources for manual research of military records. However, during the period 1965 to 1972, 15,542 national servicemen served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It is not possible to accurately provide the information requested because records held by military authorities do not record all the short tours of duty undertaken in Vietnam by military observers, reservists and advisers. However, the best available statistics are that 49,270 Australian Defence Force members comprised of 2,917 Navy, 41,910 Army and 4,443 Air Force personnel served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has advised that his Department has not undertaken a survey specifically to determine the current circumstances of Vietnam Veterans. However, the Department has sponsored a number of surveys or studies of Vietnam veterans on matters other than their employment. For example, in 1993, the Department sponsored a survey of Client's Needs and Attitudes. One of the client groups for that survey was younger veterans, including Vietnam veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, a major study of the health and welfare of Vietnam veterans has been undertaken by a group of six researchers led by Dr Brian O'Toole from the University of Queensland. Three papers describing the results and conclusions have been submitted to an international scientific journal which is undertaking an editorial review of the papers. The Department has contributed substantially to the costs of the study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the Department paid for the cost of a study `Dapsone exposure, Vietnam service and cancer incidence' by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIH&amp;W). Following from that study the AIH&amp;W conducted a further study of 46 Australian Army female veterans. This study examined the incidence of cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two studies in respect of Vietnam veterans are currently underway. One is to investigate their mortality rates and the other will examine the various health, social and vocational needs of Vietnam veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of a 1994 Budget initiative, the Government has established a National Centre for War Related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at 31 October 1994, the number of Vietnam veterans with entitlement to treatment benefits for war or defence-caused disabilities was 20 167.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Service in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces (BCOF) was not recognised with an award.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has advised that all former members of the BCOF who have operational service are entitled to claim for a disability pension and associated compensation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act (VEA) 1986 for disabilities arising from that period of operational service. Such claims are decided under the more generous `reasonable hypothesis' and `beyond reasonable doubt' tests. Treatment at the Department of Veterans' Affairs expense is also provided in respect of cancer, or any disability accepted as being war-caused. Those who are not covered for these benefits under the VEA are covered under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1988, formerly known as the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.</PARA>

Those members of the BCOF who enlisted on or after 1 July 1947 for a period not exceeding two years are also entitled to the same benefits under the same criteria. These criteria would not  normally entitle a member of the BCOF to a service pension as the veteran would not satisfy the `incurred danger from hostile forces of the enemy' criterion. Other members of the BCOF are not entitled under the VEA but receive compensation and superannuation benefits under other Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>

In this context, the ABS finds that the cost of processing registered marriage and divorce statistics ($0.25 million annually) is relative high. For marriage statistics, the cost reflects the receipt of data from Registrars of Marriages on paper, except for NSW (partially) and WA.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) and (b)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Residents of remote areas of Queensland have access to three satellite delivered television services from the ABC, the SBS and the commercial television service QSTV which is broadcast out of Townsville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the low population density, the delivery of services by terrestrial transmitters to residents of remote parts of Australia is unattractive to commercial operators. For national transmission facilities the cost per viewer would be many times higher than the provision of services to larger communities. For those living outside areas where terrestrial reception of broadcasting services is possible, the only economic way to deliver television and radio services is by satellite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of this and to ensure that remote residents have access to at least one commercial television service, the Government has in association with the Queensland Government provided QSTV with an annual subsidy since 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the passage of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) has had responsibility for planning and licensing new broadcasting services throughout Australia. The ABA is currently engaged in a nationwide planning exercise to establish, among other things, what frequencies are available for additional broadcasting services. Highest priority is being given to remote and regional areas. Planning for rural and remote areas of Queensland is scheduled for completion in early 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ABA identifies demand for further commercial television services and frequencies are available these will be allocated using a price based system. The decision to enter the market will be a commercial decision for aspirant broadcasters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Residents of Mt Isa and Longreach will soon have access to a second commercial television service. In September this year, the ABA authorised Imparja Television Ltd to commence rebroadcasting of its services in these towns under s212 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. At the same time, the ABA authorised rebroadcasting of QSTV in Alice Springs and Nhulunbuy. As a result, more than 30,000 people in rural Queensland, and a similar number in the Northern Territory, will get greater choice of television services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of new technologies, such as Compressed Digital Video (CDV), may reduce the cost associated with broadcasting to areas with low population density. Through the use of CDV, broadcasters may be able to broadcast four to six channels using the spectrum required to broadcast one channel using current technology. New technology may therefore make it more commercially attractive to provide television to viewers in remote areas.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr Beddall</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The application to import egg powder from Canada has recently been the subject of assessment by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS). AQIS's assessment is that importation of the product does not present a significant quarantine risk. AQIS's decision on the proposed importation is soon to be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) AQIS's risk assessment of the application did not rely on the paper prepared by Dr Lehane. The processing of the egg powder in question is based on technology which was apparently unavailable to the egg processing industry at the time the Lehane paper was finalised in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Nil</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The paper was not released as an official report due to AQIS's concern that the report did not provide scientific justification for a proposed 10% "cut-off" for egg content which would effectively mean that formal quarantine assessment would not be applied to products containing less than 10% egg. This question is unrelated to matters considered in relation to the egg powder application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) AQIS's initial assessment was that the heat processing according to stated parameters is technically consistent with the parameters already established for the importation of retorted peeled whole eggs from the USA. The retorted egg proposal, which was approved in July, was subject of comprehensive and protracted consultation with the States and industry including the AEIA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September AQIS circulated the proposal to import egg powder from Canada to the state departments of agriculture, poultry industry bodies and scientific organisations to advise of AQIS's consideration of the application, and to elicit relevant technical comment on the issue. All respondents except the Australian Egg Industry Association agreed with AQIS's assessment that the proposed importation of egg powder presents negligible quarantine risk, including the agriculture departments of the Northern Territory, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, and key scientific organisations, i.e. the Bureau of Resource Sciences (BRS), the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) and the Australian Veterinary Association. The NSW Department of Agriculture agreed that the thermal process would be sufficient to inactivate infectious bursal disease virus, which is used as a reference for the elimination of other organisms of quarantine concern, subject to any risk of post-processing contamination being addressed. Questions regarding this point have been conveyed to the Canadian authorities for their response. Further technical information submitted by the AEIA and its scientific consultant has been thoroughly considered by AQIS in consultation with AAHL and the BRS, both of which have agreed with AQIS's judgement that the proposed importation does not present a quarantine risk.</PARA>

The General Assembly adopted the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the Law of the Sea Convention at a special resumed session on 28 July 1994 with overwhelming support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agreement is the culmination of four years' negotiations and resolves the differences between industrialised and developing countries on Part XI's deep seabed mining provisions. Australia played a central role in the negotiations as a member of the five-member core drafting group, which included the United States delegation. The adoption of the Agreement paves the way for universal participation in the Convention, a goal which has eluded the international community because of the rejection of Part XI by major industrialised countries over the last decade. At the same time, it has secured a widely supported system to deal with all the ways in which humanity interacts with the world's oceans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government decided that Australia should ratify the Convention and the Agreement prior to the Convention's entry into force on 16 November 1994, thus enabling Australia to be an original party to the Convention. Australia deposited its instrument of ratification on 5 October 1994.
