<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the debate today on the 1995 Loan Bill supporting my colleagues who have castigated the government in trying to manage the accounts&mdash;the accounts which, according to the budget papers, look a bit shonky. The bottom line is that, when it comes to money, this government, like all other Labor Party governments over the past decade, cannot cut it and just cannot seem to get it right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor Party backbenchers come in supporting the executive of their party. They have been given a line. But I do not see many from marginal seats coming in and extolling the virtues of this issue. The reason is that they are embarrassed to put their name to the ongoing poor financial performance and management of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of debt and its management is a high priority issue in the electorate. This bill is supposed to be a mechanical bill which allows the government to draw upon funds to pay for its operation. In other words, the government requires bills like this to cover its holes in consolidated revenue. This bill allows the government to borrow more money. That is not unusual, but the government does it quite often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1980s we heard all sorts of people saying that greed was good. `Irresponsibility is okay so long as we enjoyed ourselves' was the cry of many, including, it appears, those on the other side. Greed could lead to many things, but in Australia it has led to a period of instability and huge losses of funds. We are considered by other countries to be not quite up to it when it comes to financial management, which is a shame. The reason for this assessment is that the lead that Labor Party governments provided during the 1980s was nothing short of corrupt. The Labor Party just cannot seem to manage money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take, for example, the Labor government of Western Australia, formerly led by the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), which lost huge funds during the WA Inc. period. It was a notorious period in Western Australia in which a former Premier and Deputy Premier were gaoled for theft of funds. These former Labor politicians, holding the highest office in parliament in Western Australia, played fast and loose with the state's till, and that state is now trying to work its way through the quagmire of huge public debt. The government was sacked by the people who wanted better management of their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving a little east, we see that the former Labor government of South Australia drove the State Bank into bankruptcy. The Bannon Labor government could not manage the funds and lost enormous amounts of taxpayers' funds in doing so. It was sacked by the people who wanted better management of their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving even further east, we see that the former Labor government sent the state of Victoria into virtual bankruptcy. The Cain-Kirner Labor government cost the Victorian taxpayer enormous amounts of public funds&mdash;a sad reminder that the Labor Party cannot be trusted to manage funds correctly. The government was sacked by the people who wanted better management of their money, and they did this by selecting Liberal governments in South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving north into New South Wales we witnessed the Labor Party sending its own organisation broke by entering into ridiculous property deals which have cost its organisation and members enormous amounts of funds. It tried to play the property game and failed miserably. Of course, the senior members of this organisation walked the corridors of this place and the employed officers have been transferred to the New South Wales state government payroll. I am sure the taxpayers of New South Wales would be extremely happy about the failed officers of the Labor Party now drawing upon their taxes. The fact is that the Labor Party just cannot get the money management side of things right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has the worst history of any modern parliamentary experience in Australia in managing money; yet day after day its members walk into the chamber and say that they are on track, the figures are good, the OECD is terrific and our comparisons are just wonderful. But the fact is that the Labor Party and its apparatchiks and fellow travellers cannot be trusted with taxpayer funds because they continually let us down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had cause to survey many areas of my electorate recently and the replies were very similar to the responses that came back from a survey my colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) conducted in his electorate recently. If they are similar in Western Australia to what they are in New South Wales, then the assumption can be made that they are similar in all electorates. The message is quite clear: the Labor Party cannot manage money and the electorate is concerned about it. If this message is being heard in marginal seats of the ALP, we can be assured of one thing: on this issue alone the coalition will have a resounding success at the next election. The fear and lies so effectively used by the Labor&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V5">Mr RICHARD EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fear and distortion so effectively used by the Labor Party in the 1993 election will not work again because the electorate has become cynical of the promises they get from the Labor Party. They want or they are beginning to demand responsibility&mdash;responsibility from their Prime Minister (Mr Keating), not false promises. They want hope and a future based on a sound financial base, not one based upon debt and its poor management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My research has shown that the biggest issue concerning the electorate is debt and the way it is being managed. The electorate rates the coalition as the only party which can provide the sound management practices which are required to bring back some sort of equity to all Australians. Mr Speaker, the fact that the government is looking for more borrowings should come as no surprise to you and the people of Australia. Racking up debt is the trademark of this particular government. Commonwealth public debt interest has increased a whopping 32 per cent&mdash;a figure increasing from $7.1 billion to $9.387 billion. Debt interest is on the way up. In other words, to those in the gallery, we spend $9 billion or thereabouts in interest every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, is in stark contrast to Liberal managed states which will see the public debt interest decline from $1.1 billion to $0.6 billion in 1996-97. What a difference a vote for the Liberal Party can make in some of these states. The comparison with the Commonwealth is stark and frankly not very favourable. The simple fact is that this Keating Labor government cannot manage finances and the result is the explosion of Commonwealth debt. The $9.4 billion we will pay in public debt interest equates to over $1 million per day we pay in interest. Each and every day of the year we pay over $1 million. This $9.4 billion does not go to hospitals or roads and cannot provide Australians those much needed tax cuts that have been promised before. It is all going to the financial markets. Not one benefit from the expenditure of $9 billion goes to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will recall that former Premier Kirner and former Premier Bannon both had problems with their banks. The Prime Minister seems to be following the Victorian Labor line of selling off the bank&mdash;in this case the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;in a desperate move to improve the figures. The government is selling off the cutlery, so to speak, to help it out of the financial difficulties we are now facing. But what sort of challenge are we facing? Most of the members opposite compare Australia to the G7 group, or the OECD or the other industrialised countries of the world. This is the modern cultural cringe they have: `My bank account is better than your bank account and my figures are better than yours.' But we are not truly an industrialised country, therefore comparisons are a bit out of proportion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, if one views our performance with other countries, the shocking news is that we are honorary members of the Third World. When one thinks of the Third World, the images we see are the poor and suffering of Africa. We do not naturally see other images. Some countries we may not think of are in fact in the Third World. These include Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and perhaps even Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that we are honorary members of the Third World when it comes to financial management, and to support this claim I would like to present the following figures. The percentage of debt to GDP in 1984 for Australia was 15.9 per cent. In Brazil it was 39.3 per cent; Mexico, 47.9 per cent; Argentina, 30.3 per cent; Chile, a whopping 73.3 per cent; and Malaysia, 35.9 per cent. These were the figures in 1984, just at the start of the Labor Party management of our country, and it showed we were performing pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, the percentage of debt to GDP for Brazil&mdash;these are the most recent figures available&mdash;instead of being 39.3 per cent in 1984, was 17.8 per cent; Mexico, instead of 47 per cent, was 22 per cent; Argentina, instead of 30.3 per cent, was 15.4 per cent; Chile, which was 73.3 per cent, was 15.7 per cent; and Malaysia, instead of 35.9 per cent, was minus 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1992. Australia in that same period has gone from 15.9 per cent of debt to GDP to 36.6 per cent. So in a period of 10 years we have gone past what the Third World countries were doing 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those opposite talk about private debt and assure us that it is private debt which is the problem, but it is not. The South American countries I have just talked about are performing better than us. The banana republic that the Prime Minister spoke about 10 years ago is perhaps here right now. Unless we seriously address the growing problem, it will get worse and we will become a fully-fledged member of the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time we started to get serious about our financial woes and begin the long march back to some sort of responsibility. But this will not happen under this government&mdash;or any Labor government, for that matter&mdash;because it just does not have the will or the initiative. The current account deficit has been over $12 billion for nine of the last 10 months. Every month we pay out huge funds for interest on past foreign borrowings. In fact, every month our current account is over $1 billion before we even start trading&mdash;that is, $1 billion going out and paying past debts every month. It seems that all we are doing every month is adding to that debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task before the government is to structurally reduce the debt, to lift national savings and to reduce its borrowing program. But the government seems incapable of providing the leadership and management to make this happen. To back up these allegations, we need look no further than the budget this year. It is really a great con. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must reduce our expenditure; yet the government cut it by only $700 million. At the same time, the government has lifted up taxes by $2.3 billion. Then it swapped our public savings for private savings by selling our assets. Assets do not lift national savings. They do not do anything other than get some money in to pay off the operational costs this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget there is no lift in national savings, which is what the crisis in financial management is all about. The government needed to cut its spending but was unable to do so. When it comes to management and making some of the hard decisions, the government is unable to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even last week there were examples of the government not being prepared to make some savings. Last week we had two Auditor-General's reports highlighting the continuing management incompetence of the government. One report showed that seven per cent of the Commonwealth work force&mdash;that is, some 10,000 officers&mdash;are non-operational. What are these 10,000 Commonwealth employees doing? No-one seems to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other report showed that the tax department failed to collect $50 million it was due in tax. What is the government trying to do here? It is clear that it does not know what its work force is doing, whilst it is prepared not to collect the money that it is due. Could you imagine a small business, for instance, operating like that&mdash;not knowing what your employees are doing and not worrying about your receivables? The point is that a small business run like this would close down. It reminds me of a similar experience of a former government minister who ran a sandwich shop. He did not know what his staff were doing and he paid the ultimate price. I think the sandwich shop closed down, and he paid the ultimate price of having to resign as a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is not alone. The entire frontbench of the Labor Party has no business experience at all. In fact, the Prime Minister was sacked by David Jones some years ago. One of the reasons he was sacked was that he was arrogant and was never around the place when you wanted him. The attributes that saw him sacked then could also apply to him right now&mdash;he is a bit arrogant, and he is never around the place so that we can see him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the country needs the Prime Minister, where is he? He is strutting the world stage saying how wonderful it is that he can fix Japan's problems; and he puts up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Times</EMPHASIS> saying, `Look, France is following my lead here.' However, his manager at DJs did say that he was a good salesperson. All in Australia know that the Prime Minister is a great salesperson: he is like a slick snake oil salesperson, but we do not want a slick snake oil salesperson running our accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember when Slick told us that he was not going to increase tax? We must remember that slick salespeople will say and do anything to get the sale, and that is what the Prime Minister did at the last election: he sold us a deal, and then he welched on it. He gave us a cheque, but the cheque was returned marked `Insufficient funds'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, there is no need to remind you of the 1993 Dawkins horror budget&mdash;it was a real shocker not only for the people of Australia but also for the Labor Party backbench. But I should remind you that the second stage of the indirect tax rises will fall into place on 1 July this year. These taxes, which it was promised to us at the last election would not go up, will go up on 1 July this year in the second stage of increases. So we will have tax increases ranging from three per cent to 10 per cent, increasing prices of consumables out in the marketplace and in the electorates. But Slick did not stop at the last election when he broke a few promises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your guidance, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister even raised taxes in this year's budget&mdash;this is after saying that he would not. The budget this year did not lift national savings, but it did increase tax. Company tax is up approximately 10 per cent; the Medicare tax is up approximately 10 per cent; the Prime Minister said he would permanently reduce sales tax to 15 per cent, but the tax on cars has been increased 30 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building industry, suffering from a sharp decline in demand&mdash;reminiscent of 1990&mdash;has been bludgeoned with a Keating secret tax, adding about $1,000 to the average cost of a house. So all the promises about lowering the hardship for businesses, especially small business, has been a great con. The biggest con is the way the government tries to explain the accounts. It says that we are in surplus, but in fact we are in debt&mdash;a bit of creative accounting which complements the sales job that the Prime Minister has put to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party does not know how to handle accounts, especially our savings and our current account. The Labor Party's solution is to abandon higher growth and the unemployed and to try to get imports down simply by slowing growth in demand. It has virtually given up; it cannot fix the structural savings and the current account problems, so it has given up. It has neither the will nor the way to solve these problems. Its plan is for low growth&mdash;too bad for those 750,000 Australians who have been made unemployed and those who are hidden amongst the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low growth means low employment opportunities, so we are on the roller-coaster again. The reason that the brakes are on is that the government does not have the courage to make some hard decisions. Cutting spending and lifting savings can be done in Australia&mdash;one has to look no further than the Liberal state governments to see the positive results of those governments. We must get our debt under control, otherwise we will leave our children a terrible legacy. Every time Australia records another current account deficit, we further erode our sovereignty. The Prime Minister talks about this concept, yet his talk is very cheap, for he is actively giving sovereignty away to foreign banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is very clear about its commitment to the Australian people. We will not lift taxes, and we will control our spending. All areas of spending will be put through detailed assessment and examination. If there is not a clear purpose or benefit to the Australian people, the expenditure will stop. The budget papers will not hide or distort the real financial situation. The coalition will commission an audit of the Commonwealth's finances as soon as we are elected by the people of Australia. We will ascertain the correct picture of our finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party walks away from the truth, and we can see evidence of this within the budget this year. The coalition will be about real solutions and real decisions. The government has failed. It has failed to bring down a credible budget. It has failed to tackle national savings in any meaningful way. It has failed to address its own spending. It has failed to tackle the current account. It has failed to lay foundations for higher growth. It has failed to adequately reform the labour market to maximise employment opportunities. It has failed the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is more galling is that it has failed its own constituency. It now clings to power for greed's sake. At the next election the Australian people will pass judgment on the Labor Party and their judgment, I am sure, will be: failed!

The benefit to revenue of the increase in the Medicare levy is estimated to be $230 million in 1995-96, $240 million in 1996-97, $260 million in 1997-98 and $280 million 1998-99.

However, to avoid two different rates in the 1995-96 FBT year of tax the rate to apply to the year commencing 1 April 1995 is to be a composite rate of 48.475 per cent. From 1 April 1996 and all later FBT years the rate will be increased to 48.5 per cent. The benefit to the revenue of the increase in the rate is estimated to be $5 million in each of the FBT tax years 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99.

We will do this because the budget increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent represents no less than another broken promise by Labor to the Australian community. It is another breach of faith that this government has dumped on the heads of the battlers of Australia&mdash;the working men and women who are not overly well off, who are struggling to make ends meet and who are striving to raise their families. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The raising of the Medicare levy is not just a broken Labor promise; it is a serious policy miscalculation. It takes and it gives back nothing in return. Let me explain. One of the myths that Labor has sold to the community with some success is that we pay our Medicare levy and our health needs are taken care of. In other words, Labor has sold to the Australian people the false impression that the Medicare levy receipts cover the total cost of publicly funded health care&mdash;that the two sides of the Medicare budget in fact balance. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the 1993-94 financial year, the last completed financial year, to get a picture of just how the Medicare levy revenue compared with expenditure on health care benefits, both public and private, we find the following: in 1993-94, according to the 1994-95 budget papers, the final estimate of the Medicare levy collected by the government is $3,030 million&mdash;let us say $3 billion. This is actually less than the contribution income received by private health funds in the same period, which was $4,150 million, or about $7.2 billion all up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just the revenue side. On the outlay side, in the same period of 1993-94, the final estimate of Medicare benefits schedule payments was $5.4 billion. The final estimate for PBS outlays was $1,670 million and, just as important, the benefits paid out of private health funds in 1993-94 amounted to $3.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simple arithmetic tells me this combined benefits outlay for 1993-94 is about $10.5 billion and it is another easy calculation to subtract that amount received through the Medicare levy from this total payout. The quick answer is that $7,400 million of benefits, or 73 per cent of the total public and private benefit outlays, are not funded by the Medicare levy. This does not take into account the many millions of dollars paid by people who directly pay for their own medical or hospital care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has always tried to sell the Medicare levy as an essential part of its strategy to contain the costs of delivering health care. I do not dispute there is a need for reasonable action by government and private insurers to contain costs of private insurance as far as it is consistent with effective quality care and fairness. But I think the simple exercise I have just done shows how much of a confidence trick this is on Labor's part. Nor, incidentally, do many people realise that the revenue from the Medicare levy does not actually get paid into any sort of earmarked account. Rather, it finds its way into consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy has never been anything like hypothecated towards health care costs, which is why it is so dishonest for the Assistant Treasurer to come here and justify it on the basis of changing percentage of coverage of health care costs. Anyone who knows anything about the history of Medibank and Medicare would know the original proposals were for the levy to be set at 50 per cent of total expenditure. That was rejected by Treasury. So it is completely incorrect to come in here and attempt to use that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revenue and benefits figures I have quoted to the House raise a related issue, one which this government has failed to grapple with anything like effectiveness. No doubt, as this debate continues, members on the other side will try to point to the wonders that Labor has done for private insurance through its recent legislation. I will simply point to last week's release of the latest OECD report on Australia which has something to say about Labor and private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was very keen to crow about the OECD report. Indeed, my spies tell me that he was very unhappy that the Minister for Human Services and Health had knocked him off the front page of the newspapers with her statement to parliament. The Prime Minister was not crowing about this however: on page 125 of the report, after considering Labor's recent attempts at reform, the OECD says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering future reforms. . . it would be useful to have regard to whether the intended role of private insurance is a substitute for, or a top-up to, private arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the OECD says that Labor does not know whether it is coming or going in relation to private health insurance. I think I can help the OECD there. Quite clearly, Labor would be more than happy to see private health insurance disappear from the Australian health financing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures that I quoted earlier cannot be ignored; if they are, it is at the community's peril. Given that private insurance contributions outweigh Medicare levy collections and private insurance benefit payments come close to rivalling Medicare benefit schedule outlays, one can see that their role in health financing is a vital one in quality health care in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And we have to face the undeniable reality that private insurance is under increasing strain as contributors drift away from membership at an ever-rising rate. In December 1993 the total proportion of the Australian community who had private insurance was 36.3 per cent. Over the 1994 calendar year this dropped 2.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In just the first quarter of 1995, the proportion decrease was to 35.6 per cent&mdash;a decrease of 0.7 per cent or, spread over a full year, almost three per cent. This is an ever-accelerating rate of dropout. At this rate, private fund insurance will be not much more than one in five by the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`So what?' those on the other side may ask, as they have on very many earlier occasions in this place. The answer is simple enough. If the money does not come from private insurance&mdash;or other self-provision for that matter&mdash;it will come from the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the government knows, it has been reliably estimated that every one per cent fall in the level of fund membership results in an extra $100 million outlay in Medicare benefits. Or, to put it in a perspective that should have crossed the mind of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and his advisers in framing this budget, the $230 million estimated extra revenue, to be taken in 1995-96 through the increase in this levy, will be more than offset by the cost of making provision for the increased demand on public resources caused by the exodus of private fund membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be sure, this hike in the Medicare levy will put that much more pressure on middle income earners who have private health insurance but who wonder whether they can still afford the cost of the premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Healthwatch survey conducted for the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia provides some ominous messages for the government in this regard. One in seven privately insured people said that they are more likely to drop their private cover as a result of this levy increase. If one in seven people left at the one time, it would take private fund coverage to well below 30 per cent. The compensating public funding contribution would have to come from somewhere. This levy increase that we are having today is not just a little fiddle; it is not just another broken promise. It is positively harmful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, there is another question which the Minister for Human Services and Health put on the agenda by making a statement to the House about the findings of the Australian hospital care survey. That question relates to whether we are getting a quality health system in return for the billions of public and private financing dollars we inject into it. Elsewhere in this budget we see the government cutting back on the real level of grants to the states for the operation of public hospitals. Yet, if it says anything, the hospital care survey highlights just how fragile the balance between good judgment and error can be and just how easy it is to stray on the wrong side of that margin in the high stress intensity of hospital life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality health care is not something that can be delivered on the cheap. We on this side of the House recognise this&mdash;some of us from our own experience as health care professionals. As much as we realise the need to control costs, we accept that this cannot compromise the basic quality of care offered in our health care system. This decision to raise the Medicare levy yet at the same time effectively constrict both the public and private resources to Australian hospitals and the level of support for private insurance is both misguided and short-sighted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Healthwatch survey to which I referred a short time ago also indicates that more than half of all Australians believe health services in Australia are getting worse, not better. Their confidence would have been further shaken by the sensational coverage of the hospital care survey, coverage which was fuelled by the way the story had been promoted privately to the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that this survey is being released so early at a time when we do not have the full information to understand what it means. I am concerned when I hear people talking on radio about incompetence and 14,000 deaths and at the same time I hear one of the authors of the survey cautioning that these are potentially preventable only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot support the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, as I said earlier. It gives effect to a wilfully broken Labor promise to the Australian people. I will repeat the minister's sentence a third time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no proposal to increase the Medicare levy and there won't be.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made less than a year ago. We also oppose this levy increase because it gives nothing to a health care system that struggles valiantly to do the best it can, even with limited resources. Australians may expect more value for their health care dollar but they are getting less in both quality and quantity. In the final analysis there could be no choice for us other than to oppose this measure from a discredited government. </PARA>

Like the honourable member who has just concluded his remarks, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), I will focus my attention on the Medicare levy aspects of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to look back to 1983-84 when the levy was first introduced. Indeed, the budget speech of that year introduced the levy as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Medicare, to operate from February 1984, all Australians will be covered automatically for the costs of basic health care regardless of their income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare will be a simple, equitable and universal system of medical and hospital cover.</PARA>
<PARA>In that last sentence we encapsulated the fine intentions for and the reality of Medicare under this government. This scheme has lived up to the promise we made in this context back in 1984 when the Medicare levy was first introduced. It has developed as&mdash;and continues to be&mdash;a simple, equitable and universal system of medical and hospital cover in the way its founders intended. I am very proud of the part my predecessor in the seat of Bonython played in the development, evolution and establishment of that system of medical cover for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the views we have just heard in this place, the scheme has obtained very high levels of satisfaction by the clients of that scheme, the electors of Australia. That is reflected in the recent OECD report to which the honourable member referred. I will quote from that report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic survey 1995</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I did not hear him make the following quotation. In the section dealing with health, the paragraph discussing levels of satisfaction in the community with respect to Medicare begins with the following sentence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community satisfaction with Medicare, the compulsory public insurance scheme, is high and rising.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know that it is rising from a very high base. That indicates a stronger degree of satisfaction with that scheme throughout the community. It is certainly not the view of any member of this House that it is a pleasant task to increase any rate of taxation or levy. The Medicare levy is no exception. It has increased from one per cent, when the scheme was first introduced, to 1.5 per cent in the proposals before the House. But one cannot look just at the financial and statistical absolute level of that increase, the one per cent to 1.5 per cent&mdash;or, in the case of the most recent increase, from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent&mdash;over that 11 years. One has to look also at the nature of the outlays and the way the levy goes towards financing those outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy reached a peak with some 30 per cent of health outlays being financed by it. In 1994-95, had the Medicare levy remained unchanged, it would have financed some 24 per cent of those outlays. If the parliament approves the increase now before us, the levy will finance some 27 per cent of those outlays. So while the levy has had to be increased, it has only reflected the general trend in health outlays in this country and in all other OECD countries. I will turn to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very relevant when one is considering the impact of the levy to also examine the way those health expenditures have changed and the way the Medicare levy goes towards financing those expenditures. It is not the case that the government has maintained, as a matter of policy principle, that the Medicare levy was intended or ought to fund 100 per cent&mdash;or some fixed, prescribed percentage&mdash;of medical and hospital outlays. That is not the objective of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the opposition spokesman in this area pointed out, the levy is not hypothecated. I would be very opposed to any serious hypothecation of these kinds of taxation levies. The levy has a specific purpose and it is linked to the health system and to health outlays. It is a matter of government budgeting and management priority to determine how that should be reflected in the overall taxation mix. Health and outlays for health stand on their own&mdash;they are an arguable case&mdash;and the Medicare levy which is associated with that, but not directly linked in a statutory provision, needs to be argued separately according to the budget circumstances of the times and according to the economic circumstances of the population of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very instructive to look back at the historical trend of health outlays. If we go back to the last significant period of coalition government&mdash;the 1950s, the 1960s and the early part of the 1970s&mdash;we find that, as a percentage of GDP in 1960, health outlays were some 4.9 per cent of GDP. That rose to the princely percentage of 5.7 per cent by 1970. From 1975 to 1985&mdash;I am combining a few of the figures&mdash;the average is about 7.5 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we get to 1990-95 we find that we have reached the point of 8.5 per cent of GDP in approximate terms. An increasing percentage of outlays on health expenditure reflects a change in attitude in the developed world. If one tracks increases in per capita GDP throughout the world along with outlays on health care you can see a very strong correlation between the two. It is perfectly reasonable that as the population becomes more wealthy, through increasing per capita GDP, it is going to expect an increasing share of that GDP to be given towards the kind of personal benefits which health care provides. That is a very high priority for most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD average is, at the moment, some 8.3 per cent of GDP. Therefore, we are slightly ahead of that. The EC average is 7.5 per cent, which is well below our average. The G7 nations come in at 9.4 per cent of GDP, reflecting the much higher level of expenditure that those countries have. However, I think you would find that many of those countries that have substantially higher expenditure, particularly the United States, fail to live up to the standards which we have set for our country and which the Medicare system has met. I refer to the quotation I read earlier which talked about a simple, equitable and universal system of medical and hospital coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are many in the United States who are able to pay the higher medical bills and are able to be covered by insurance, that does not apply universally to the population by any means. I think it is very clear that our universal and equitable system is preferred. The recent debate in the United States Congress between the President and the republican group exemplifies the kinds of problems which we have managed to avoid in this country. It illustrates why our scheme, and those like it in countries such as Canada, is envied by other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, we are in the position of having to increase the levy by 0.1 per cent partly because of the proportional changes in health expenditure but also to ensure that the revenue side of the budget is also addressed in this context. That is why I made the point earlier that this is not simply a decision about a Medicare levy but a decision made in the context of not only the health needs of the nation but also the budgetary and revenue situation of the government at any given time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at the impact of the Medicare system in this country, I think it is also very important to look at some of the ways in which it might be improved. We heard earlier in the quote about the OECD report that community satisfaction with Medicare is very high and continuing to rise. In relation to health expenditure per capita we compare well with other countries when we even up the issue of exchange rate variations. If we compare our health expenditure per capita with that of other countries in the OECD with whom we would customarily be compared and if we look at who is satisfied with their existing health care scheme we find that Australia comes out very well. We find that with Australians there is a high level of satisfaction for the level of expenditure which we incur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those countries which have higher levels of satisfaction all spend considerably more of their GDP on health cover, so they are buying that increased satisfaction at a very high price. It is a matter of continuing debate in Australia what percentage allocation of our gross domestic product should be put towards health care. We have to strike a balance in these issues. When we examine Australia's position on the graphs of satisfaction versus expenditure we find that Australia features well in that area and that the present arrangements strike quite a good balance for the population of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to examine a couple of matters in relation to what the opposition tells us about private health insurance and the impact the Medicare levy has on Australia's private health system. One issue is the absence of any definitive policy from the opposition in this area. Since the time of the Fraser government we have heard statements about the opposition maintaining the Medicare system or the precursor to that system. We have heard those statements and claims and many of us regarded them with some degree of scepticism at the time of the Fraser government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were right at that time. Recent trends have seen only a re-run of that kind of procedure with the prospective new member for North Sydney, Dr Brendan Nelson, who is well known to us here in his former capacity as AMA president. I suspect that he will become better known in his capacity as a Liberal candidate. One has to wonder when that transition occurred when looking at some of his speeches earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The harsh reality is that the opposition has no clear and definitive policy with regard to how it will address the health care needs of this nation. Where there are policy initiatives taking place, we find substantial contradictions between those who allege to speak on behalf of the opposition about what they will be. Whether they maintain Medicare, bulk-billing and the existing scheme, which Australians may or may not rate highly, is something that we no doubt will have to wait somewhat longer to see, possibly days before the election. I caution members of the public to look very closely at the comments of members of the opposition to determine what that policy is, if they are considering it in an election context. I do not think we will get too much warning of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues of private health coverage in this country are often canvassed. The figures quoted are often quite misleading. They often reflect a decline in all those who have had at one stage any form of private health insurance. It covers those who at one time had private insurance to cover private treatment in a public hospital as well as those who have always maintained private treatment in a private hospital insurance context. They are quite different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have quite properly identified that they are not getting terribly good value for money in paying private health insurance to arrange for private treatment in a public hospital. They will receive very good treatment in those public hospitals at the expense of the Medicare levy. That is what they are opting for. That is where we have seen the greatest fall in private health insurance numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a decline in the level of those at the other end of the system&mdash;the top end of the system&mdash;who are paying full coverage for total health insurance in private hospital areas. Their cover has dropped, but not by anything like the margins that we have seen in the overall decline of private health insurance. That is the area where the policy questions need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the spokesman for the opposition pointed out, we have addressed those areas. This parliament has recently endorsed the government's private health insurance package, which will go some way towards ensuring that private health insurance is more open to competition in accordance with the Hilmer reforms, which this government is pursuing at a broad level. It will ensure that private insurance is free to offer people much more innovative packages than they have had in the past. In the past, private health insurance has been like the two-airline duopoly. We have seen a number of private health funds offering almost identical policies at almost identical prices with almost no competition between those funds either in the prices or the services which they offer or in terms of the breadth and depth of those schemes. We have certainly not seen any initiative or entrepreneurial activity in respect of the kinds of products that they offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation which this parliament has recently approved will go a long way towards ensuring that the funds are able to offer better policies and packages to their clients. I believe that we will see the benefit of that over the next 12 to 18 months as they take effect. We will also see other initiatives in the area of casemix and incentive payments under the Medicare agreements. They will also contribute well towards the development of a more responsive health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly endorse the remarks in the OECD report about the need for more appropriate incentives in some areas of our health expenditure. Those areas are well complicated by the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and the need to enter into agreements with each of the states about the way in which they fund their public hospital systems. Those issues will have to be covered in Medicare agreement discussions between the Commonwealth and the states in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that part of that discussion will be about the development of much better indicators of health care, health coverage, waiting lists and waiting times. Far better incentives will be built into the system to ensure that, like casemix, we have the right financial barriers to push people and hospitals in the right direction. It is essential that we have a very good handle on the information and data processing needs of that area to guarantee a very effective response by the health insurance system, be it public or private, to the changing needs of the client base and the changing efficiency and productivity relationships of the medical industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I commend this bill to the House. While it is never a pleasant duty to be involved in a debate which concerns a tax increase, even when it is of the order of 0.1 per cent as it is in this context, it is essential to look behind that fundamental point, that arithmetical point, and look at the underpinning structure which Medicare brings to this country. It has, indeed, lived up to the promise of 1984 to be a simple, equitable and universal system, one which all Australians have every right to be proud of. </PARA>

It also makes a minor upward adjustment to the low income thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increase in the Medicare levy is in spite of claims made by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) last 19 June, which the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has raised, which are worth repeating. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no proposal to increase the levy and there won't be. Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister went on to say that a rise in the levy was more likely under the coalition's policies. It was the old scare tactic: accuse your opponents of doing exactly what you intend to do yourself. The statements the minister made then are no more reliable than the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on tax. Remember, our Prime Minister had the gall on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program of 19 November 1992 to say, `What I am promising is not to put up tax.' No-one could misinterpret those words. No-one could possibly misunderstand the meaning and intention of those words which were said prior to the 1993 election. Neither broken undertaking, either that of the Prime Minister or the minister, should be a surprise to anyone here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's record, both as a minister and as a Premier of Western Australia, is a total disgrace. Her performance in the federal parliament has been consistent with her efforts in Western Australia. In 1992, when still Premier, the minister decried the fact that Western Australia received too many tied grants. When the Prime Minister then suggested that the states could possibly have greater flexibility, so long as the Commonwealth could monitor the state programs, the minister&mdash;that is, the then Premier of Western Australia&mdash;said, `I've always found that a touch insulting, to be honest. The states are required to account for their expenditure to their parliaments and voters. I don't think if money is given to the states that it is, in a sense, any of the Commonwealth's business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Human Services and Health has had another one of her famous attacks of amnesia because by June 1994 the same minister had somehow come to believe that it is very much the Commonwealth's business. When pushed by the states for greater freedom with health grants, the minister said, `History shows you can't trust the states with health funding. Just handing over large number sums of money with no strings attached and no penalties for failure to perform would be a betrayal of the Australian community. It's clear that it is not an option that could be endorsed by the Commonwealth.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing like first-hand experience. Metaphorically speaking, you send a thief to catch a thief; you send the Minister for Human Services and Health into this Commonwealth parliament to catch up with all those terrible people in the state parliaments, one of whom was her&mdash;a very notable, if not successful, practitioner in the state scene. It is not surprising that the minister now supports an increase in the Medicare levy. However, I doubt there are so many gullible voters out there who will continue to believe her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the bills, the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995, increases the fringe benefits tax rate from 48.4 per cent to 48.475 per cent for the year beginning 1 April 1995 and increases the levy to 48.5 per cent on 1 April 1996. The budget papers state that the increase in the Medicare levy `will ensure that Medicare levy receipts make a greater contribution to the cost of government health programs'. Remember that. It says `a greater contribution'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that in 1995-96 the Medicare levy is estimated to generate $3.6 billion in revenue, even though the outlays for the Department of Human Services and Health come to a massive $19.618 billion this same coming year, and expenditure on specific health related matters will be an almost equally massive $18.42 billion. Surely, if the government is serious about increasing the Medicare levy to ensure that a greater contribution is made by the levy to the cost of the provision of health services, there is nothing to rule out the government further increasing the Medicare levy. It is open-ended to put forward that justification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such logic means that Labor could increase the levy by 100 per cent to cover the cost of medical services and benefits or by double that again to cover the cost of hospital services. Using Labor's rationale, there is no upper limit on future increases to the Medicare levy until revenue generated by the levy equals the total cost of the provision of health services. That is a natural consequence of the excuse for this increase included in the budget papers. The Australian community should watch this space because, as sure as night follows day, Labor will continue to increase the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, as the government increases the Medicare levy, it also increases the fringe benefits tax rate. The increase in the FBT rate reflects the government's desire to make sure that the top marginal tax rate and the fringe benefits tax are the same, otherwise there would be an incentive developed in favour of the fringe benefits tax away from income tax. The transitional rate of 48.475 per cent for the 1995-96 year has been explained in terms of avoiding two different rates applying in the same year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of FBT has grown way beyond what was originally intended; that is, closing a small tax loophole. This type of grab for even greater revenue is of great concern to taxation practitioners and to employers. Although not necessarily ever having subscribed to the policy behind the original FBT law, businesses have long bowed to the inevitable and come to accept that pure salary packaging benefits were irrevocably caught up in the FBT net. They accepted that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has clearly stated that this particular tax grab will not be limited to benefits which are substitutions for what otherwise would have been taxable income in the hands of employees. Labor's aim is clearly to impose FBT more and more on so-called non-salary package benefits. Expenses of a business nature are to be caught up in the net, expenses that never were and never could be&mdash;except in the eyes of a revenue hungry Treasurer&mdash;construed as substitutes for salaries to individuals and to entire categories of employees. In other words, the FBT is a tax on business expenses that are not, and never were, benefits in the hands of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, definitions for the so-called benefits to be brought into the FBT net are simply not available. There is simply an absence of knowledge. No-one knows, by dint of certain knowledge, of their obligations. So what will this mean? The chances are, once again, that discretion will be given to the Australian Taxation Office to decide the nature of business expenses to be caught up with the proposed extension of the fringe benefits tax net. That is hardly a recipe for either certainty or equity. The March edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation in Australia</EMPHASIS> put it well in an article entitled `Milking it'. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FBT is a champion little milch cow, that the government is accused of having force-fed, that it has become an overgrown and extremely clumsy beast. Originally designed to do no more than close a loophole exploited by a few high income earners, it has since intruded into an astonishing variety of tax areas. For many companies, it has become not only a cow to administer, but a bull in the China shop of company accounting processes and a nightmare of compliance.</PARA>
<PARA>The cost of compliance, along with the spread of the FBT, is the most insidious aspect of that tax. The fact remains that between 1987 and the 1996-97 fringe benefits tax year there will have been six different fringe benefits tax rates. These constant changes only add to the exorbitant costs in complying with this impost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Businesses in this country face a cost of more than $1 billion each year in compliance costs. Of these costs, it is clear that the fringe benefits tax is one of the greatest elements. In 1989-90 the compliance cost for the fringe benefits tax was $128 million, which was 10.2 per cent of the total fringe benefits tax revenue of $1.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the same period, employers spent an annual average of 1,100 hours complying with FBT laws. This equates to a half time worker for the typical firm subjected to the fringe benefits tax. The compliance costs for employers' PAYE tax was $629 million, which was 1.4 per cent of the gross PAYE tax revenue. For payroll tax, the compliance cost was $206 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian businesses spend up to 11 times more than companies in the United Kingdom complying with direct tax obligations. Analysis undertaken by Challenge Bank shows that in 1990-91 on average 96 per cent of companies incurred higher compliance costs&mdash;at $10,129&mdash;than they remitted in income tax, which was an average of $7,079. It cost them more to remit the rotten tax than they actually collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worst of all, compliance costs tend to be higher for the small business sector. Small firms with a turnover under half a million dollars spend on average three per cent of their turnover complying with taxation rules, compared with 0.2 per cent for companies with a turnover in excess of $50 million. Compliance costs generated by the current tax system markedly discriminate against small businesses. Small business has little to thank this government for. The Prime Minister, in an arrogant fashion, tells small businesses, `This is as good as it gets.' God help us if this is as good as it gets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even this most recent budget compounds the problems faced by the small business sector: it has slugged the small business sector with increased costs. For the information of honourable members, this includes the introduction of a sales tax on building materials, which will increase the cost of housing. There is a five per cent increase in the sales tax on non-luxury cars, as well as an increase in the company tax rate from 33 to 36 per cent. That latter tax applies to both large and small businesses if they are incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the new twice monthly PAYE remittance arrangement, as well as the increased FBT rate&mdash;which I have just been discussing. On top of that, there is the increased cost of lodging company documents and occupational licensing, fundraising and acquisition schemes. To top it all off, there is the adjustment of the interest rate which the Reserve Bank pays on non-callable deposits, which banks hold with the Reserve Bank of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these proposals will add considerably to the cost structures that small businesses face and will make it much more difficult for a small business person to make an honest dollar. The fringe benefits tax has also made a big impact on the mining industry. This industry is, as everyone should be aware, an important employer in my own state of Western Australia. It is in fact the engine room for the west's economic strength and growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining industry is particularly vulnerable to the fringe benefits tax because, with mines being mostly in remote, uninviting locations, it is necessary to provide incentives to attract competent staff and to pay a competent work force. Many of these incentives could not be defined as a benefit but are more akin to compensation for having to live in a remote location. In contrast, manufacturers can locate their operations more readily in or near major urban areas and therefore have less difficulty in attracting staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the FBT legislation needs to be reviewed to take into account the incentives and compensatory payments made by mining companies. In a nutshell, the mining industry and small businesses need a simple FBT system with low compliance costs. This can only be achieved by a meaningful attempt to simplify and limit the scope of the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simplification of tax rules and regulations would not only make the lives of many ordinary Australians more productive but also increase national competitiveness and exports, and generate new sustainable jobs. To date, the government has spoken a great deal about simplifying the tax system but has done too little too late to further that stated objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, Labor's record is abysmal. As early as the 1985 tax summit, in a draft white paper the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A good tax system should be as simple as possible . . . to reduce the burden of record keeping . . . to increase the certainty of what is or is not taxable, and to increase the clarity of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>Labor has failed to meet even its own objectives as set by the then Treasurer, let alone those set for the government by the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 February this year the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced a package of measures resulting from the government's review of FBT compliance costs. Unfortunately, this announcement and the review it heralded have been too long in the pipeline. What is worse, this review offers little hope that the government is taking the issue of simplification seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The serious shortcoming in how the government tries to simplify the FBT law, and other tax laws, is that it refuses to reconsider the policy foundations upon which the FBT and other taxes are built. In effect, the government only tinkers with the edges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FBT legislation foreshadowed in the budget has not yet been introduced into the House&mdash;though, because it applies from 1 April 1995, the coalition has been expecting it in this current winter sitting period. We are still waiting. While the expected bill will reduce some compliance costs associated&mdash;thankfully&mdash;with car parking, taxi travel, entertainment and living-away-from-home allowances, the government will increase the tax on employer provided cars to 10 per cent to offset expected losses in revenue. This further confirms Labor's true agenda with the FBT. It has only been expanded over the years because it is easy to squeeze out extra revenue from that source. The other issue related to this coming bill is that it already applies, although it is not yet the law of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has yet again legislated by press release. Taxpayers are to assume that the changes as outlined in a press release will be eventually legislated as stated in the press release. We have only to look at some past examples of legislation by press release by this government, and it would hardly be surprising if the government makes changes to the bill before, or after, it comes to this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the bill, when passed, will apply retrospectively from 1 April 1995, those taxpayers relying on the details of a press release could be in very deep trouble. After all, a press release has no standing in law when the legislation states something different. Legislation by press release is an administrative action which needs to be avoided at all costs&mdash;and particularly in these circumstances. Essentially, it offers too much scope for taxpayers to be denied natural justice and a fair go. The bill is opposed by the coalition.</PARA>

It might be of interest to note that, of the six opposition speakers, three are from Western Australia. In other words, more than half of the Western Australian membership is speaking in this quite narrow debate about a 0.1 per cent rise in the Medicare levy&mdash;although I suspect that they will all be speaking about the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few years I have found it fascinating to watch, inside and outside of this place, the Western Australian members of the Liberal Party and the degree of vitriol, venom and malice they carry within themselves, between themselves and towards other people in their state. It just seems that they never miss a chance. If there is ever a chance to bag the minister in some venomous way, over some distortion, they all jump to it&mdash;and here today we have one more example. There are five Western Australian members of the Liberal Party in the chamber; out of a total of six speakers on the bill, three of them are from that five. I do not think that is coincidental. I think this is part of the same tawdry tactics. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this current climate we have to look at the real agenda. In this debate, having heard the comments made by the Western Australian members, it is clear that the real agenda is not the 0.1 per cent increase in the levy; it is the philosophy of Medicare and bulk-billing. It is yet another tawdry attack on the minister&mdash;a distorted and venomous attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of this parliament on 1 February 1985 and one of the things I am very proud of is the introduction and development of Medicare. It has been one of the great social changes in this country. Looking at the world's health and health funding systems, we can claim to have the world's best with Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988-89 the Medicare levy raised about 30 per cent of the actual expenditure on health. It is now down to about 24 per cent. This proposed increase in the levy is an attempt to restore that difference to some degree. For a party that talks about battlers and user pays, the Liberal Party has to face up to this reality: our community wants more and better services in health. We know that from the demand, from the polls and from the feedback we, as representatives, receive. How do we pay for that? Do we make the battlers pay all the extras or do we try to spread the burden across the whole tax base? An increase in the levy is by far the fairest way to catch up the increase in expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1985-88 and 1994-95 there has been a real increase in health expenditure of over five per cent. The coalition would put it on the battlers to pay for that increase. It would get rid of bulk-billing and make the users pay. The increase in the levy that we are suggesting is based on a capacity to pay&mdash;the more you earn, the more you pay. This levy is about being fair to battlers. We have heard a lot about them lately from those on the other side and I am surprised that, in the coalition's usual distorted way, we have not heard about them in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People want us to increase the levy. We heard last week about the problems in our hospital system&mdash;the suffering, the premature deaths, the incapacitation&mdash;and, clearly, we need to focus more closely on it. The Medicare agreement gives the Commonwealth a very important instrument by which to negotiate with the states. If we look back over the last 10 or 11 years of Medicare and at what has been done via the agreement, if we look at how the Commonwealth and the states have started to unify and standardise procedures across the country, we see that the changes have been enormous. The use of the agreement has been fundamental to that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, all the extra things that have been done are costing somebody. The coalition would argue, `Don't give them a health service. Cut it out altogether or else make them pay for it. Make the users pay. Forget incomes and capacity; make them pay. If they want it, they pay for it.' That is what the coalition would be arguing for because, if it were not, it would be supporting the increase in the levy as a way of maintaining the levy's contribution to health expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the kinds of policy responses we are making in areas like the national demonstration hospital program, a combined program of the Commonwealth and states, one sees that they seem to be funded by the Commonwealth, as most of these programs are. Areas like pre-admission assessment, admission scheduling, operating theatre management, discharge planning and post-discharge services are the kinds of areas in which we are trying to improve the quality of our services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of a report tabled last year on the home and community care program. That report went into a great deal of detail about the use of post-acute funding and how post-acute funding works in with the community support sector. The fact is that these things have to be funded from somewhere. They are real increases in expenditure and those increases are best funded by a charge based on capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the Commonwealth-state Medicare agreements 1993-98, the national hospital quality management program was established. It is aimed at promoting a national approach towards the improvement in quality of care. This seems to relate very much to the study results of last week, which show that we need to look at those issues. The Commonwealth has been saying for a very long time, `We have some problems in health areas, but they are administered by the states.' We have tried to use the Medicare agreements as a vehicle to provide both the money and the leadership to address those issues. The announcement of last week reinforced just how strongly those things are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should maintain that kind of leadership and maintain a shift in resources in terms of the health budget overall being increased compared with other budgets. That is happening, and the community wants that. It wants better health. I think the major issue in both the elections held in recent times, in ACT and New South Wales, was health. The community is signalling to us very clearly that it wants increases in health. How do we achieve that if there is not some increase in funding? I presume the opposition would argue to cut spending. One wonders how much of the opposition's $10 billion of savings in outlays would come from health. One day the opposition may well tell us where, if and how. The community accepts that more services cost more money. The community is also aware that the levy increase is by far the fairest way of financing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other kinds of things have been developed in that period and I want to particularly mention the Australian health ministers benchmark working group. That works from the idea of trying to establish benchmarks between states, within states and across the country, and of using Commonwealth resources and leadership in doing that. One particular area is the rate of unplanned hospital readmissions within 28 days of the person leaving hospital. Another is the rate of unplanned returns to the operating room during the same admission. Those are the kinds of things we need to focus on desperately, given the concerns that came through last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often made the remark in terms of post-acute support in home and community care that we are much better off having people recuperating at home because homes are safer. One does not find much golden staph in people's houses. One of the issues for that ministerial benchmark working group has been the hospital acquired infection rate. That really is an extremely important issue. We know it happens, but we have to do something more about it than simply talk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of this is that these things are additional programs. They actually cost more money. We come back then to the process. Before the Medicare agreements were introduced in 1984, the Commonwealth simply gave the states some money and we can see the result of that: there was no leadership, there was no uniformity and there was no cross-referencing. In the 10 years since then, we have seen a much greater coming together of our systems across the country. Ministers, state and federal, are meeting and developing uniform approaches so that we start to develop a truly national health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is our health system in world terms is good, but it could be better. We have to keep working at it all the time, because the day we stop trying to make it better will be the day that it will fall in a hole. The figures of last week show that. The opposition has argued at various times over the years, certainly way back in 1983, that the Medicare levy was really states business; it was none of our business. The fact is the community does not agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community has endorsed this government and Medicare election after election after election. It has endorsed increases in the Medicare levy previously. From my own comments and feedback from my community, it certainly accepts this as being a much fairer way. The community wants health to be improved. It wants the Commonwealth to lead in that way.  The community wants Medicare to be endorsed and supported, and it wants people to contribute from their capacity to pay, not from the idea of user pays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you get the disease, you pay for it yourself&mdash;that is the philosophy that we have heard so much about throughout our country's history. That philosophy has changed and the community has endorsed that change. This increase in the Medicare levy is a fair increase. It does not fully redress the shift in balance of the levy contributions to the total health budget. It is still three per cent behind what it was six years ago, but the fact is that this increase is a fair way of approaching it. It is clear that it is not just I who endorses the legislation but the Australian community. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill could very well be called `Another Labor Lie Bill'. Then again, much of the legislation we are debating in this place at the moment could be called that. The bill increases the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent. It is a seven per cent rise in the Medicare levy and represents another broken promise by this government. It is a 50 per cent increase since the introduction of Medicare in 1984. Last year on 19 June, the Minister for Human Services and Health issued a news release headed `Claims of levy increase ridiculous says Lawrence'. It then read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Claims in this mornings newspapers that the Government "is set to increase the Medicare levy" are demonstrably untrue, Federal Health Minister Carmen Lawrence said today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`There is no proposal to increase the levy and there won't be', Dr Lawrence said. `Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the minister publicly ruled out any increase in the Medicare levy. Has she forgotten about Laborspeak?  Laborspeak for `The tax cuts are law&mdash;L-A-W&mdash;law' means, `We will repeal that law and forget about the tax cuts.' Laborspeak for `What I am promising is not to put up tax', which the Prime Minister told <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> in November 1992, means, `The tax is going to go up.' Laborspeak for `I will be recontesting the next Western Australia state election as the Labor leader' means, `I'm going to pull the pin and enter federal politics.' So Laborspeak for when the minister said, `Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase,' means, `We're going to slug you with another seven per cent increase.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came despite the former minister Graham Richardson, in answer to a question from Laurie Oakes asking whether he could guarantee the rise from 1.25 to 1.4 per cent was the last rise in the levy, saying on 2 May 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I can guarantee is no-one in the Government has any thought that the levy should go up&mdash;no-one. So there's no plan being looked at and I'd have thought in the short term&mdash;the next few years&mdash;no hope of it going up at all.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that only two years ago. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no plans whatsoever to try and jack it up. I mean, it's fairly high. People are paying 1.4 per cent of their income and that's a pretty hefty slug . . . I think there are other ways to contain the costs and pay for them than simply jacking up the levy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the former health minister had to say. His comments are an indictment on this government. The present minister, the present Prime Minister and the former minister all said there is no reason for the levy to rise, yet we are today debating a rise in the Medicare levy. The coalition is opposed to the rise. There is no mandate to increase the Medicare levy. It is a dishonest rise, and the coalition will naturally oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Medicare levy is an extension of income tax, though with alternative thresholds. It is a tax on one's income. Therefore, this tax increase is an increase in one's income tax. It reduces the disposable income of Australians. The government will argue that it will amount to only $30 a year and that the rise is necessary to cover rising costs associated with claims. Graham Richardson said that the levy, when at 1.4 per cent, was a hefty slug. So, at 1.5 per cent, the $30 a year rise makes it an even heftier slug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports Medicare. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 4 June the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) reaffirmed our commitment to the retention of Medicare, the retention of bulk-billing and the retention of community rating. The government is always quick to point out that the community is satisfied with Medicare. The 1995 OECD economic report on Australia claims that community satisfaction of Medicare is high and rising. Those rating it highly rose from 46 per cent in 1987 to 54 per cent in 1993. Only 18 per cent had a fairly low or very low satisfaction rating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding those figures, I would query whether most taxpayers realise how much they are paying into Medicare and our public health system as a whole. The budget proposes an $18.4 billion health expenditure for 1995-96. Not all of it comes from the levy they pay. I realise that it should not. Many people are of the understanding that the levy covers our health budget when it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report to which I referred also included two other interesting and pertinent statistical points. Firstly, the major reasons for dissatisfaction with Medicare appear to be hospital waiting lists and poor hospital service, with 23 per cent of those surveyed mentioning those points. Secondly, the membership of private health insurance funds had fallen sharply from 50 per cent in 1984 to 39 per cent in 1993. It is even lower today. The Medicare levy increase will neither reduce the dissatisfaction of the community with Medicare and, in particular, the hospital waiting lists, nor encourage greater membership of private health insurance funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD report stated that there were 7.2 people per 1,000 waiting for elective surgery in 1984. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates an average clearance time for the national waiting list to be 2.3 months; 40 per cent of category one patients&mdash;for whom, in the opinion of the treating clinician, admission is desirable within 30 days&mdash;on waiting lists have waited over 30 days. Of the elective surgery patients, all but one category&mdash;cardiothoracic surgery&mdash;had a percentage of patients waiting over 12 months to be admitted. That is an appalling statistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An MBF survey last year revealed that 20.4 per cent of respondents or their immediate family had to wait to get into a public hospital; 62.2 per cent said that they knew of others who have had to wait to get into a public hospital; and 84 per cent were concerned about waiting lists for public hospitals. One reason for the large waiting lists is a result of increased reliance on Medicare. This came about, I believe, at the introduction of Medicare. People were led to believe they were covered by Medicare and as soon as something went wrong Medicare would cover them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare was introduced to provide universal health insurance for all Australians. There is nothing wrong with that objective. People with private health insurance who could afford to maintain their membership of private health insurance dropped out, relying instead on Medicare. Many people who could afford to take out private health insurance&mdash;the Prime Minister and the Minister for Human Services and Health are two examples&mdash;do not have it. This simply adds to the burden on Medicare, with, barring levy increases, no additional funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give as an example what happened with one of my staff members. He recently had his wisdom teeth removed. From what I can work out, it has not made him any sillier. His dental surgeon said that, if he wanted the procedure done in a public hospital, he would be forced to wait for 18 months. He had it done in a private hospital and was in and out in one day. The procedure cost $650. His private health insurance gave him $458. He could have covered the whole procedure with what he had put into private insurance over the last few years and still be in front. He has now withdrawn from private health insurance. Had he withdrawn earlier and relied on Medicare, he would simply add to the burden and increase the average waiting time. This example is no orphan. A constituent wrote to me in February of last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My wife and I contribute handsomely to Medicare via the annual levy. In addition, we are members of the Hospital Benefit Fund at the highest level, including Ancillary Cover. During November 1993, my wife Michelle underwent a serious operation at St John of God Hospital, Subiaco. The doctor's fee for this service amounted to $1,988. Medicare refunded $722.20 and HBF $240.70, a total refund of $962.90. We were thus confronted with a balance to pay of $1,025.10 . . . We pay good money to both Medicare and HBF and yet are still confronted with an enormous difference to pay.</PARA>
<PARA>The second case I mentioned also highlights the minimal refunds offered by Medicare and private funds. I suggest this is because the government takes a confrontationist approach to the AMA, which recommends the doctors fees. Medicare does not take notice of doctors. It dreams up its own rebate for the service, but still leaves a massive gap because it takes no notice of the normal charges of doctors&mdash;charges, I might add, which in the norm recognise their work and skill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the main fact is that encouragement needs to be given for people to take out private health insurance and to keep it. If more people continue to drop out, it will simply add to the burden on Medicare. There are wealthy people who use Medicare but, if they need a procedure where they must endure a wait, they can afford to pay for it. One lady I know of, and I should point out that all of you know this lady&mdash;and two doctors rang my office and confirmed this&mdash;needed a cholecystectomy. The average clearance time for this procedure for all elective surgery patients is 2.8 months&mdash;that is, if you are an ordinary patient. This lady was diagnosed one day and had the procedure completed two days later. Perhaps being the health minister has its benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private health insurance is important for the government to restrain spending. The OECD report on Australia talks of the ambiguous role of private insurance in the Australian health care system. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . insurance is supposed to be an optional add-on to the universal Medicare scheme, paying for choice of surgeon and better quality hospital accommodation. But if this were really the case, private inpatients would pay only the extra costs of more comfortable accommodation and choice of surgeon. Instead, they pay for total accommodation costs plus all other costs apart from the Medicare benefit for medical services. These contributions are estimated to save Medicare some $2 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA>The report also, when dealing with the high level of activity in private hospitals for procedures for which public waiting lists are long, suggests that access to treatment is obviously not based on clinical need&mdash;rather, on the ability to pay&mdash;and, therefore, it violates one of the foundation principles of Medicare and undermines the equity of the health system. While the principles behind Medicare are excellent and worth while, there are still some fundamental problems. Private health insurance should be complementary to Medicare and not a substitute for it. Encouragement needs to be provided for people to go back to private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Graham Richardson, when he was the health minister, said that he would be worried if the number of people with private health insurance dropped below 40 per cent. It is now well below that, and the minister and the Prime Minister should set an example by taking out private health insurance. A recent poll by MBF found that 74 per cent of Australians believed that the Prime Minister and the minister for health should take out private health insurance, but they are yet to heed that message. Seventy per cent of those surveyed who hold private health insurance are likely to drop out as a result of the levy increase. The glossy image of Medicare painted by those opposite turns out to be a mediocre system when you apply the turps and see the real image beyond the government's claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that greater reform is needed for Medicare so that it does allow for private health insurance to succeed, so that individuals and families on higher incomes are encouraged to take out private health insurance and so that lower income earners, those for whom Medicare was essentially designed, are not forced to wait for admission to hospital longer than is desirable in the opinion of the clinician. Private health insurance is essential for our health system; therefore, encouragement must be provided which in turn assists the lower income earners who are competing for hospital beds with those who can afford private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I oppose this bill for a number of reasons: it is a dishonest tax rise; it will not improve the operation of Medicare, which is needed; it hits the battlers of Australia, who are suffering enough as it is; and it will further erode the membership of private health insurance, which is a crucial component of our health system. </PARA>

I am a bit concerned about the comment made by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) that three Western Australians are talking on this bill, because health is a very important issue to all Australians and should not necessarily be limited to eastern staters. The reason why Western Australians talk about this particular issue is that we do care about the health system of Australia, and we do care about the health of Australians. For the member for Newcastle to say that we attack out of hand the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is not necessarily correct, although I will be referring to that today.</PARA></TALK.START>

Never before in our history has the country been led by a group of power-crazy moguls who will do anything to hang on to power. As an example of that, the member for Newcastle in his speech said that we will abolish Medicare when we come into power. That is plainly wrong. A typical reaction that Labor Party people have to these statements is to say something long enough and it is believed to be the truth. It is plainly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party belittled the faith the majority of Australians placed before it at the last election when they said, `Please rule us for the next three years.' In my view, the Labor Party has brought disgrace to the institution of parliament and lowered the standing of many fine parliamentarians who sacrifice themselves within this place to serve their country and their community. The Labor Party is but a shadow of its former socially driven self&mdash;those who were respected years ago&mdash;because now we really do not know when it is telling us the truth or when it is a distortion of the truth. It continually distorts the truth and tries to hide facts, as brought out by this budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a tax increase. Your government is very good at increasing taxes and trying to hide it as some sort of great social order. It is a tax increase. The Prime Minister was found out yesterday&mdash;and this is the same Prime Minister who promised l-a-w tax cuts; the same Prime Minister who promised that all senior Australian citizens would be off the tax system; the same Prime Minister who said he would not raise taxes; the same Prime Minister who said that he did not believe in a consumption tax but used stealth to raise tax for the indirect wholesale sales consumption tax, which, for the parliamentary secretary's benefit, increases on 1 July. The Prime Minister just cannot be believed when it comes to these sorts of quotes. He has a great quote which I would like to use in this forum on debate on this bill. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other basic social ill facing Australia . . . is the problem of workers having two jobs . . . It is bad enough for the working man to be dragged away from his home at night when he should be with his wife and family but it is even worse when he has to send his wife out to work in order to make ends meet . . . Husbands have been forced to send their wives to work in order to provide the necessaries of life. Young mothers have been forced out of their homes by economic pressure . . . In the last couple of years the Government has boasted about increasing the number of women in the work force. Rather than something to be proud of, I feel that this something about which we should be ashamed . . . Is it doing anything to put the working wife back in her home? It is not.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said those words early in his career in this place. How true they are of today. The Minister for Human Services and Health also has a few skeletons in the closet when it comes to those sorts of issues. But the fact is that Australians have lost faith in their politicians&mdash;and we can blame none other than the Labor Party for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Medicare Levy Act. But why are we amending the act? Frankly, it is to raise the Medicare levy. The reason a universal health scheme was introduced was to help those Australians who could not afford the medical system. It has been welcomed by many Australians, and the message the coalition has is that we will not be altering the basic bulk-billing requirements of the health system. It is working for a lot of Australians. In fact, the appointment rate has increased. The average appointment rate prior to Medicare coming in was about four appointments per year. It is now up to about 10. So more people are using the health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in Australia we also need a viable private health system, and it is unfortunate that it seems to be driven down by those opposite. Even the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) agreed earlier today in this debate that Medicare was never meant to cover everyone; rather, it was supposed to supplement the private health system or vice versa. When former Senator Graham Richardson was health minister, he said that we should work towards having a private health system that retained 40 per cent of health users within the private health system and that, if we did not, we would create operational difficulties within the health system. Yet the number of people with current private health insurance equates to only 36.3 per cent. Over the year of 1994, the total drop was 2.1 per cent. But just in the first quarter of 1995 the proportion decreased to 35.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this rate we can expect that private health insurance fund membership will not be much more than one in five within a decade. Yet the former minister, former Senator Graham Richardson, said that we needed 40 per cent within the private health system. On its own estimates, the cost to the government is $60 million per year for every one per cent reduction in private health fund membership, but I am sure many people would agree that it is more like $100 million a year. This is an increase in the cost of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill tries to regain some of these costs. But what sort of impact will it have on the battlers of Australia? This is a tax collection rort and a great distortion, because the Medicare levy does not go any way towards paying for the total cost of health outlays. We need private health users, yet this government seems set on reducing the number of members of private health funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the government is taking its own constituency for granted and that this will be reflected at the next election, particularly in marginal seats. It is very interesting that Labor Party marginal seat holders never seem to speak about tax issues and tax increases in here. In fact, they are hardly ever here. They are probably out electioneering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the approximate levy collection was about $3 billion. The total collection for private health funds was about $4 billion. In other words, a total of $7 billion was collected to pay for health costs. How much did we pay back? Through Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits we paid out about $7 billion and in private health payouts we paid a total of about $3.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simple arithmetic says that the combined benefits outlays of approximately $10.5 billion are a bit different from the amount of the total collections. So raising a levy is no panacea of problem solving. All the government is doing is adding it to consolidated revenue. This adds more to overall expenditure requirements, which seems to be a government requirement because it really is overspending in a lot of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bonython mentioned the OECD and its report on Australia. Those opposite always mention the OECD, the G7 and all these other great organisations. However, they never compare themselves with other countries. As I said, the member for Bonython mentioned the OECD. However, he</PARA>
<PARA>failed to mention page 125V of the report, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering future reforms . . . it would be useful to have regard to whether the intended role of private insurance is a substitute for a top-up to public arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, from what I can gather from the debate so far, the government really does not have an idea as to how to operate a viable private health system. The government has been warned that it needs a viable private health system, yet it continues to fail to act. People are falling out of the private health system very quickly, but the government still does not act. Members of the Labor Party would be happier if the private health funds closed up shop for they have not listened to what is happening within the health industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that, if we do not get supplementary funds from the private system, we will have to draw on the public purse. Quality health care is something that cannot be delivered on the cheap. The coalition recognises this. As much as we realise that we need to contain costs, we accept that this cannot compromise the basic quality of care offered in our health care system. Labor, by contrast, seems to have lost sight of this wider view of health care as it seeks to increase its revenue take on the one hand and screw down health care resources on the other hand. The decision to increase the levy is misguided in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians believe that health is important but it is getting worse, not better. If one surveys one's electorate, as I do often, besides debt management, health care is an important issue. Let me give an example of health care and how it seems to have gone off the rails. A constituent of mine, a lady called Anita Perceval, has a son called Sam. Anyone with young children will realise that an ear infection is very common in young children. Her young son Sam waited with a painful ear infection to get some grommets put into his ear. They were put in his ear, six months later they fell out, and he now has an infected ear again. The point is that he has an eight-month wait before he can get those grommets put back in, otherwise he will have to pay $500 up front to have them put in now to relieve the pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the health system is universal and it does help most Australians, as the parliamentary secretary probably would agree, the point is that most Australians have to wait for health care. Why should a person like Sam, who is only three years of age and who is in constant pain, have to wait eight months to get elective treatment? There are some problems with the health system and we are not necessarily addressing them. Putting up tax levies is not necessarily addressing them either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We oppose this bill. We oppose this tax increase because it gives nothing to this health care system that struggles to do its best with the resources that it has&mdash;even with them stretched to the limit. Australians quite rightly expect more value for their health dollar but they seem to be getting less in quality and less in quantity. The bill does not address the particular needs of health care. In my view it is a broken promise by the minister. Therefore, I support my coalition colleagues in opposing this amendment bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) aided and abetted that process because prior to the last election he said unequivocally that there would be no tax increases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister then went to great lengths to perform a stunt, but I will not go through it again. Effectively, he brought in legislation&mdash;he did not simply say there will not be any tax increases&mdash;which was intended to make sure that there would be no tax increases. He also promised Australians that there would be tax cuts. We all now know, a couple of years down the track, that he reneged on that promise. He has twisted his way around it and he has tried to divert attention away from that fact. But, by any measure, he has quite clearly failed to deliver on that promise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One question that keeps coming to mind is why the Prime Minister does not have private health insurance. Surely somebody who earns as much as he does should not be loading up the public system. He of all people should be setting the example by having private health insurance. I presume that if he needed surgery of some sort he would simply take the view that he could afford to pay to go into a private hospital. The fact is that he should not be loading down the public system. Many people wonder why the Prime Minister does not have private health insurance himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking on behalf of a number of my own constituents, I know that many older people and many pensioners struggle to retain their private health insurance. The bulk of people in the private health system are older people. Almost by definition they see the very clear need for private health insurance. There is a problem in the private health system in that it is harder to encourage younger people to get into it. Clearly the users of the system are also the ones who are in it, and they are mostly older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People dropping out of the private health system will have the effect of making it more expensive. Once the costs are spread across a smaller number of subscribers, private health insurance will become more expensive despite the government's latest ham-fisted attempts to try to fix the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many aged people, pensioners and self-funded retirees will struggle to maintain their private health insurance. Unfortunately, many of them will be forced&mdash;not as a matter of choice&mdash;to drop out of private health insurance simply because they can no longer afford to be in it. Self-funded retirees&mdash;I have many constituents who are in that category&mdash;will have to pay this increased Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to concentrate for a moment on the plight of self-funded retirees in this country. I take every opportunity to do so because I have a large number of them in my electorate. Let me make the point: these are the people who have done exactly what we want every Australian to do. Let us not cast aspersions on those who have not done it, but let us be aware of the fact that these people have been fortunate enough in many cases&mdash;and frugal enough in others&mdash;to have provided entirely for their own retirement. But what reward do they get? They get absolutely nothing. In fact, they get the reverse. They have been consistently treated badly by this government for having done the right thing and provided for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will pay the increased Medicare levy. They will be slugged by that. They will struggle to continue to pay their private health insurance. They get the double whammy of this budget: they get an increased Medicare levy but they do not get their promised tax cuts. Obviously, by definition, they have already retired, so they do not benefit in any way from the government's you-beaut plans to convert the tax cuts into some sort of superannuation contribution down the track. So self-funded retirees miss out there. Things become increasingly difficult for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families, despite some minor changes to the thresholds of this legislation, will pay the increased levy. Many families who are in private health insurance&mdash;these are often families with young children or young married couples intending to have children&mdash;want to be able to make the choice of going into a private hospital. They will struggle to maintain private health insurance, and they will pay the increased Medicare levy as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of very clear reasons why we should oppose this tax increase. I make that point very purposefully. We are talking here about a tax increase. We were promised that there would not be any tax increases, and we will not allow the government to get off scot-free. One member of the government is in this House at the moment, the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). As my colleague observed, very few government members will come in here to face us in these debates on tax matters, probably because they are hanging their heads in shame. But we will drag them in here to vote on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, and they will vote in favour of it. We will sit on this side during the division&mdash;which I assume will occur early this afternoon&mdash;and vote against these tax increases. Hopefully, the people will observe government members sitting on that side voting in favour of tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also oppose the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill for pretty much the same reasons. It is a consequential amendment bill because it relies on the top marginal tax rate. It is also simply another broken promise. For the same reasons I have already outlined, we will vote against that bill. That is our objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is a promise worth? Obviously not very much. I suppose that most Australians who have listened to the government making these promises or who have read about them will shrug their shoulders and think, `Well, that is a political statement of some sort.' But where is the credibility? There is none. The government made promises. They were not ambiguous promises, ambivalent promises or even equivocal promises; they were promises that something would not happen, yet it did. That is why we are objecting to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the difference between a broken promise and a lie? I suggest to you that there is absolutely nothing. That is why we had the debate in here yesterday after the Prime Minister made a statement accusing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) of having said something which he had not said. Naturally, the Leader of the Opposition took exception to that. I think we had to have that debate. I suppose this was the debate that we `had to have', if I can borrow that terminology. We clearly exposed to the people of Australia&mdash;as if it needed any further exposure&mdash;this Prime Minister's incredible capacity to tell other than the truth and to attempt to get away with it. But he did not get away with it yesterday. That little exercise exposed him for what he is and he was caught out. </PARA>

We are debating today what seem to be, in a sense, in terms of revenue measures, fairly small issues&mdash;but they are huge in terms of the question of credibility. The debate today really focuses on the credibility of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Human Services and Health who could make absolutely clear statements about tax increases and Medicare levy increases, yet we are asked today to vote in favour of these increases. We will not do that and, in this particular matter, we will show all government members up for what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax, which we are dealing with here, has been a resounding success for the government since it was introduced in 1986. I note from the budget papers that this year it will raise almost $3 billion. I say that it has been `a success', but I am not sure whether that is the right way to describe a tax. It certainly has been successful in collecting a whole lot of money. There have been many inconsistencies with the way the government has gone about applying that tax, and the government has reversed some of those in recent legislation. However, there remain three areas of concern: the application of the assessment process; the application of fringe benefits tax to business expenses, which are not exactly benefits to employees&mdash;I noticed that my colleague the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution to this debate dealt in some detail with that&mdash;and the impact on the fringe benefits tax on the pattern of spending, particularly as it affects restaurants and the tourism and accommodation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this legislation, fringe benefits tax now is set and will be set retrospectively, incidentally, by a couple of months to 48.475 per cent. It will go the full way to 48.5 per cent from 1 April 1996. One of the problems is that this is higher than are some employees' tax rates&mdash;and that, of course, would apply mostly to part-time employees. So cashing out from any employers is not an option&mdash;and that, of course, means that this is just one way in which the FBT mechanism is flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that the imposition of this tax has been extended way beyond its original intentions. It might have been one of those things which was a good idea at the time, although I never supported the way it was imposed on employers rather than employees&mdash;but I think the horse has bolted well and truly on that. The fact is that it has gone way beyond its intentions. We now see situations, particularly where award requirements or deals are negotiated&mdash;enterprise agreements between employers and employees&mdash;that actually provide for certain conditions, where they then are clearly not fringe benefits. Yet there are still a number of instances where employers are being required to pay fringe benefits tax on benefits which are not in that sense benefits at all but are requirements of the employee's job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish on that point. I am very pleased and proud to stand here today and say that we will vote against these tax increases. I hope it will be appreciated by the people of Australia that we want to restore integrity to the political process. I hope we will; I believe we will. I believe that we will not promise things we do not intend to deliver. When we win the next election, we will not have our leaders running around saying that things are other than they are. I want to see integrity restored to the process and, in my view, our vote today will be evidence of that. </PARA>

Under this legislation, the Medicare levy is to be increased from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax legislation&mdash;I will refer to this very briefly because I mainly want to talk about the health policy, the budgetary policies and the broken promises attached to that&mdash;will only reinforce in the minds of many people in Australia, particularly in small business, that this government is intent on raising more and more revenue from the very people who will provide the greatest hope for recovery in Australia and will provide the greatest job opportunities for our unemployed, particularly our young. Of course, I refer to small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wherever you go in Australia&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, I know that you are attentive to the needs of your constituents&mdash;you hear small business people lamenting the high cost of compliance imposed on them by government taxes. In fairness, they are not just federal taxes; they are also state taxes&mdash;but certainly they are predominantly federal taxes. These people mention their dismay at the ever increasing costs, particularly in relation to fringe benefits. I take the opportunity to again record my dismay on behalf of many Australians at what this government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take the opportunity to place on the record again, in the few minutes I have, that on 26 February 1992 the Prime Minister announced in his One Nation statement that he would deliver tax cuts in two rounds, costing $3.5 billion each. He said that new tax scales would be introduced in two stages&mdash;on 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. On 9 February 1993, in another statement&mdash;the Prime Minister has a propensity for launching statements with rather generous descriptions of them; this one he called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS>&mdash;at the National Press Club, when questioned about the promised One Nation tax cuts, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are not a promise, they are law&mdash;L,A,W&mdash;law. And the difference between a legislated tax cut in some Opposition speaker's manifesto is all the world of difference, and they were signed into law at the end of the last parliamentary sittings.</PARA>
<PARA>After the election, back at the National Press Club on 22 July 1993, the Prime Minister announced that `the tax cuts now legislated are to be paid in two parts&mdash;one in July 1994 and the second in January 1996'. In the August 1993 budget, the then Treasurer announced that the timing of the income tax cuts rate scale changes announced in One Nation would be altered but that the tax cuts would be delivered. That is on the record. What do we find now in June 1995, a little over two years since the Prime Minister made these commitments on 9 February 1993, when he reminded Australians that legislation had been passed through this parliament to ensure that his promises would be delivered?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that in its first two budgets this government has, in fact, broken its major promises regarding no new taxes and has increased taxes substantially. I will briefly review them. In the 1993 budget the Prime Minister introduced new taxes to reap about $3 billion a year in unused long service leave taxes and annual leave lump sum payment taxes, it increased tax on credit unions, it increased fringe benefits taxes and it brought in an increased general rate of wholesale sales tax&mdash;up two percentage points. I remind honourable members that one per cent came in last year and the other one per cent comes in on 1 July this year. Those things are as a result of last year's budget. We have not even seen the effect of the increases in the budget being debated during this session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister increased the general rate of wholesale sales tax, as I said, by two percentage points. He put an extra sales tax on wine and cider. He increased petrol excise by 7c a litre for leaded petrol and 5c a litre for unleaded petrol. The country people of Australia, some of whom I represent in my electorate of north-east Victoria, would love to tell the Prime Minister personally how that has impacted on their family budgets, their businesses and their costs because of the extra fuel that country people have to use in their everyday living, let alone in their employment. He increased tobacco excise in the 1993 budget and introduced a departure tax. Those were the taxes that he said he would not introduce but were in fact introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now in this budget, in this bill, we see an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent, which he promised he would not increase. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) gave a commitment on behalf of the government that Medicare would not be increased, even after the election, even after the months when it was obvious that the government knew it was in a financial dilemma and that it was pulling the levers the wrong way in mismanaging the economy and had to stem the haemorrhage but was not courageous enough to stem the haemorrhage and manage the services of government efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget, apart from the Medicare levy, we see an increase in company tax from 33 to 36 per cent, which will raise another $320 million. I remind honourable members again that much of that extra revenue will come from small business, which has not, in many cases, recovered from the recession, which has depleted its reserves&mdash;most small businesses are operating on an overdraft and higher interest rates which have increased three times in the last 12 months. This government is now asking those people who create new employment in Australia to bear a greater tax burden, after he promised them he would reduce their corporate tax rate to 30 per cent. He now wants to increase the rate to 36 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of sales tax in this budget to certain building materials raises another $215 million and will impose extra costs on many people, particularly young home buyers, up to about $1,000 or so. There is some debate about the amount. I think the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) would know that I am about right when I say that figure. The sales tax on passenger motor vehicles will raise $330 million and a greater sum over the four years of something in excess of $1,400 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that scenario we then look quickly at the health position and we see that what the government is doing is adding to the costs of running families&mdash;in this case an increase in the compulsory Medicare levy. The direct effect of that will be an acceleration in the number of people who will exit from private health insurance. We are already heading towards 700,000 to 800,000 Australians who have exited in the last 18 months or so. In the 12 years of Labor government, we have probably seen in excess of three million Australians exit from private health insurance. The consequence of that is that it has added to the cost of running the Medicare system, added to the cost of the provision of public health care in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is sheer madness for a government, without putting in place some means of ensuring that families will remain in private health insurance, to increase taxes through the Medicare levy at this stage. It will only accelerate the number of people who will depart from private health insurance. Consequently, it follows as a matter of logic that more people will be seeking public hospital care in the next year or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cycle will then get worse as more and more people join the queues in public hospitals, as more and more people seek essential services, as more and more people want to know why they cannot get it straight away, as more and more problems occur, such as the one the minister for health referred to in her ministerial statement last week about mistakes in hospitals&mdash;perhaps even worse&mdash;where, unfortunately, some 14,000 Australians appear to have suffered great misfortune due to problems in hospitals. Many, not all, of those problems were attributable to hospitals being unable to cope with the increasing demand on them due to the number of people exiting private health insurance and looking for what the previous Prime Minister Mr Hawke promised on behalf of the Labor government&mdash;access to public health care whenever you want it because you are part of the Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that this legislation is only going to make the position worse. The health minister, I am sure, if she were given the opportunity to be frank, would exclaim that this legislation should be defeated; would agree with the opposition that it is only going to make her task harder to provide these services. </PARA>

Do you concede that Australia's high foreign debt, which the Labor Party took from $23 billion in 1983 to $167 billion today, is one of the main reasons why Australians pay the highest commercial interest rates amongst major industrialised countries?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that Australia has increased its foreign debt over the last decade and a half is something which is attributable to the deterioration in our savings performance going back to the middle of the 1970s. As has been acknowledged by a member of the Liberal Party executive, the fastest rate of growth of foreign debt in Australia was during the period when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. That growth in debt is something that we would rather not have happening in this country, but it has to do with the fact that we allowed that weakness to develop in terms of savings during the period of the late 1970s and early 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said yesterday, essentially since we have been in office, after the first two or three years, the level of debt as a proportion of GDP has largely been stabilised. In fact, in recent years&mdash;in the last year or two&mdash;it has come down from a bit over 40 per cent to 37 per cent. Yesterday's figures showed only a slight increase. That was solely due to valuation effects&mdash;not to any underlying increase in debt in Australian dollars, but just valuation effects due to the devaluation of the Australian dollar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign debt situation has improved in recent years&mdash;in the last couple of years. It has been this government's job to try to make up for a situation of substantial deterioration which occurred during the period of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the future, obviously it is important that we get that current account deficit down. In the budget I have announced major steps towards achieving that. Those steps will involve our being able to tackle our not too flash savings performance, by way of improving our budget dissaving to get the budget deficit into surplus and to bigger surpluses in the out years so that we do not have public sector dissaving and that major drag on the national saving performance; and a major boost to private sector savings through the superannuation initiatives, which will certainly have a dramatic impact on household savings in the course of the next decade or two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are fundamental, sound structural changes to savings in this country which will have enormous impact in terms of our current account performance in the future. As the Treasury has pointed out in statement No. 2, the major factor behind the current account deficit moving to 4 1/2 per cent of GDP average in the eighties and nineties was the public sector decline, and it is the restoration of that public sector savings performance which this budget brings into absolute focus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the wholesale market, interest rates have been moving down notably, and anyone who looked at the papers today would have seen that the 90-day bank bill rate is less than the official overnight rate&mdash;less than 7 1/2 per cent&mdash;and that the long-term bond rate has come down to about 8.6 per cent from over 10 per cent not so long ago. Clearly the markets are looking at Australia and saying that inflation is substantially under control&mdash;and of course it was a lack of control over inflation, going back over the last couple of decades until the latter part of the 1980s, which gave Australia a burden to wear in terms of higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The markets have made it clear that, unless we restore credibility over a long period, we wear the burden of higher interest rates. We have established lower inflation in this country. We now have a strongly growing economy with low inflation, and that is something that could not have been dreamed about a dozen years ago when we came into office. It is something which is absolutely in place now. We have had low inflation for the last several years, and a continuance of low inflation is certainly something that the markets now expect. As we earn our spurs, we will see our interest rate performance get better and better.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of parliament do enjoy certain privileges, and one of the most fundamental is the right to come into either chamber of the parliament and make statements without fear of civil suit for defamation. That is an important privilege which members of parliament should, rightly, enjoy. However, if that privilege is to continue to be enjoyed and if its use is to be respected by the Australian community, there has to be an exercise of responsibility on behalf of members when they avail themselves of that privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exercise yesterday by the member for Deakin is quite clearly an expressed breach of that responsibility. If any honourable member, including the member for Deakin, has matters which he or she believes disclose offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, the appropriate course of action is to refer those matters to the Australian Federal Police for investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obviously two clear reasons for this. The first is that, in our legal system, people are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. People are entitled, if charges or allegations are made against them, to have those allegations pursued by the police without the glare of publicity and without the consequent damage to their reputation. The second, equally obvious, is that, if there were some grain of truth to these allegations, as bizarre as they may seem, the making of such public statements&mdash;an abuse, in my opinion, of the forms of this House&mdash;would prejudice to some extent the capacity of the Australian Federal Police to conduct an investigation without the subject of the allegations being forewarned and maybe taking appropriate steps.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. On 30 May in parliament you referred to the problems in the US `in terms of falling real wages and the vast number of working poor'. The unemployment rate in the US is much lower than in Australia. Real average weekly earnings in Australia are now lower than they were in 1983. According to the Union Bank of Switzerland's latest survey of prices and earnings around the globe, an unskilled builder's labourer in Los Angeles earns wages 90 per cent higher than a comparable labourer in Australia. How can you say to those labourers that this is as good as it ever gets?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an absolutely ridiculous question. On 30 May I was referring to statements made by the US Secretary of Labor at the OECD in which he said that he was greatly concerned about the fact that the United States labour market had produced relatively low unemployment, which was a good thing, but at a price which he saw as being very high. He was greatly concerned about that price&mdash;that price being that there was tremendous disparity in wages within the labour market and that disparity had meant that there were lots of working poor.</PARA></TALK.START>

So there is a markedly greater disparity in wage outcomes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is trying to imply here that there are some higher wages in the United States than there are in Australia. Certainly it is true that GDP per person employed in the United States is higher and that the wages probably on a translation across to Australia are higher. That is because it is the richest country in the world in terms of income per head. Of course it has got higher real wages taken as an average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point is that, if you are concerned about battlers&mdash;as you say you are&mdash;then the United States labour market is the one which does nothing for battlers. It is the market which produces these enormous disparities and which produces an outcome of large numbers of working poor in circumstances where real wages, which is part of Mr Reich's comment, had not been increasing for years. In the United States the median wage had not been increasing at all. In fact, the wages of many people were going backwards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, quite clearly, Australia's debt is well below the levels of other countries. I am talking here about all levels of government, not just the Commonwealth. If Australian debt levels were equivalent to the OECD average, our additional debt would be some $78 billion. The recent budget ensures that our debt will reduce considerably over the next four years. That is because we have moved to a budget surplus in 1995-96 with increasing surpluses over the out years&mdash;building from $700 million in 1995-96 to $7.4 billion in 1998-99. Those surpluses will lead to a reduction in Commonwealth general government debt by almost 30 per cent as a share of GDP, taking us down&mdash;this is the Commonwealth only&mdash;from 19.1 per cent of GDP to 13.7 per cent. These are very considerable reductions.</PARA>

This would represent a very rapid reduction in public sector debt by international standards. The only other Western country looking at substantial debt reduction over the next few years is New Zealand.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by saying that it is perhaps useful for the House to note that the European monetary union has established a set of convergence criteria which member countries have to satisfy before the process of monetary union can proceed&mdash;before they can move into the third stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Perth for his question. I did see those comments in this morning's paper. It is extraordinary, given the attitude of the other ministers at the health forum on Friday, how out of step Mr Kierath is. He has threatened `to embark on a big campaign to shift health costs onto the federal government' and he has threatened a showdown at high noon in Alice Springs next week unless the Commonwealth delivers. That is very much a confrontational and, I think, irresponsible approach that is at odds with the attitude taken by other ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the Australian hospital care study, all of the other states have indicated that they want to work cooperatively with one another and with the Commonwealth. We have had an assessment of the effects of private health insurance changes on the state governments and also the extent to which they have engaged in cost shifting to date. What was seen from the Western Australian minister, although he did hear some of the discussion of ministers via telephone, was a typical shoot from the hip reaction which we have come to expect of that government in Western Australia&mdash;the cowboy actions of a cowboy government, its eyes off the ball again, out of step with the rest of country and increasingly erratic in the way it conducts its affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any move by the WA health minister along the lines that he has outlined to promote cost shifting will certainly backfire. I would like to draw his attention not only to the fact that the Commonwealth provides very substantial funding to the states under Medicare to enable them to provide a comprehensive range of public hospital in-patient and out-patient services but also to the fact that we will adjust the hospital funding grants if they cost shift to that extent, and that is listed in this year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, the particular arrangement that Mr Kierath points to would result in doctors being prosecuted. They would be in breach of the respective Commonwealth acts. We intend to take very firm action indeed against any states, individual public hospitals or doctors who cost shift to the Commonwealth in that way, using provider numbers inappropriately and illegally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kierath says that he is interested in Western Australians and does not want them to suffer. I must say that I have not noticed that in any of his previous policies. Let us look at the facts which surround the claim that he is interested in their wellbeing. First of all, the Western Australian government should particularly look at its very dismal record on health expenditure to find the real causes of the problems. For example&mdash;and I will table the appropriate graph&mdash;in 1993-94, its first full year in government, state funding for hospitals from its own sources fell by 20.6 per cent in real terms. It took $100 million out of Western Australian hospitals. The minister has the temerity to suggest that he is going to shift costs onto the Commonwealth. It has already removed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that Mr Kierath either does not know what is happening in his own budget or simply refuses to acknowledge it. I think that what he is actually doing is shaping up for the upcoming budget because all the signs are that the state government intends to cut funding further. We have seen a 20-odd per cent reduction in funding from the state government in the face of a 31 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding. This in one draw and out the bottom draw policy is apparently going to be exacerbated under this new minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an environment where Western Australia is growing rapidly and its revenue is growing rapidly, yet the government there is prepared to penalise hospital funding in that state. Taxes are going up as well. This is very cynical and tawdry politics and is very much at odds with the views of all the other health ministers. I point out that, far from being innocent of this practice, Western Australia has already attempted to cost shift by threatening last year to close down the radiation oncology unit at Royal Perth Hospital and pass on the costs, at that stage, to the consumers and the Commonwealth. Fortunately, we heard about this and the Commonwealth stepped in directly. We are now providing funding to enable a continuing radiation oncology service in one of our major teaching hospitals in Western Australia. In that case, arrangements are in place to recoup any additional Medicare benefit schedule outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on that minister to withdraw those charges and make sure that his actions do not actually result in doctors being charged and their tax records perhaps being examined as a result. If they are using their provider numbers and claiming income that is not theirs, I am sure that there will be other people interested in this matter besides the health minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not ripping all that away. Let us look at the history of company tax since we have been in office. When the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer he had a company tax rate of 46 per cent. Under us that rate was increased at one stage to 49 per cent, but in the context of there being full imputation for dividends. The Leader of the Opposition had a 46 per cent rate and double taxation of dividends. We increased that rate to 49 per cent, but in the context of bringing in full imputation. We took away double taxation of dividends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a major boost to shareholders in this country and a major attraction for people to invest in equities. We then moved to reduce that rate to 39 per cent and then, later on, to 33 per cent. There have been major steps taken in the area of company tax to reduce the rate by some 13 per cent below what it was when we came into office and to remove the double taxation of dividends. In addition, the investment allowance, brought in as a temporary stimulus to investment&mdash;nevertheless, with the effect of cutting effective company tax rates&mdash;the development allowance and the 150 per cent write-off capacity in research and development, which is an increasing attraction for companies to undertake research and development and reduces their effective company tax rate, have been very stimulatory for companies in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget we have increased the company tax rate by three per cent, which takes it back to 36 per cent, but it is not, as the questioner implied, a reversal of the previous decision. We made that decision to take it back to 36 per cent as a means of saying that, in terms of the current need for us to increase revenue, the best and obvious place to look is to those areas where major concessions have been given in the context of the recession and its aftermath. Clearly, companies have been given that substantial benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As also mentioned in the question, we are concerned to have a structural change in company tax for competitive reasons. When we reduced it from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, we had an eye on the rates in other OECD countries and in the region. Clearly, in looking at the possibility of increasing that rate again, we were concerned not to move too far away from the rate of 33 per cent because of those competitive factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The movement up to 36 per cent still leaves us in the competitive range, particularly in the context of there being full imputation still applying in this country. We are one of the few countries in the developed world that gives full imputation for company tax. That is still there 100 per cent. The other allowances, such as the developmental allowance, are still there. The investment allowance is now starting to phase out but it is still affecting levels of company tax being paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no ripping away of the benefit, as mentioned by the questioner. The fact is there was some reversal of that decision but only a partial reversal. In looking at the need for there to be fiscal tightening in this country, it is appropriate for companies who have high levels of profits, and had major concessions on their company tax rates effectively, to bear some of the burden of that increased need for fiscal tightening. In the circumstances that we face, the decision taken is thoroughly reasonable. There has not been a great deal of complaint from the corporate sector about it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He suggests the following: an 11.8 per cent cut in social security, a 13.4 per cent cut in health, a 39 per cent cut in labour and employment, a 43 per cent cut in housing and community amenities, and a 66 per cent cut in culture and recreation. They are the sorts of broad cuts he envisages in order to get $15 billion to $16 billion out of this commission of audit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In social security, he proposes a 12-month limit on unemployment benefits to save about $1 billion. So after one year on those benefits you will receive no more benefits&mdash;saving about $1 billion. On the age pension, he proposes to end the automatic indexation. So, apart from an odd one every now and again if you felt like it, there would be no more indexation. He also proposes that eligibility for the age pension be raised from 65 years to 70 years. On child care, he proposes to do away with means tested fee relief and have a regressive 25 per cent tax rebate to save $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also proposes the following: for health services, a $5 per visit charge to the doctor to save a billion dollars; in public hospitals, a full charge for the first day's treatment to save $460 million; the abolition of the general system of pharmaceutical subsidies to save $434 million; for education, reduce the number of beneficiaries of Austudy by 100,000 to save $300 million; on culture, sell the ABC and end taxpayer funded film finance to save $79 million, phase out the Australia Council; and cut out government expenditure on sport and recreation and so on. That is the kind of agenda that Mr Moore said would be possible through a commission of audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the member for Werriwa that the government does not intend to adopt Mr Moore's proposal. We already have one of the smallest public sectors amongst developed countries. Because it is well targeted, we have been able, nevertheless, to ensure that we have an adequate social wage which provides substantial support for people on lower and middle incomes. As the Minister for Social Security said in question time yesterday, the social wage has been greatly increased under this government, with a 75 per cent real increase per capita under us compared with a 17 1/2 per cent decline under the previous government when the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed that the establishment of a commission of audit has been proposed by the opposition since February, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his post-budget speech at the National Press Club. In proposing this commission of audit, the opposition is following a well worn track of Liberal oppositions at the state level in this country. They have done it in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. In every case, it has been used as a device to hide their real intentions to impose swingeing cuts in government expenditure and to increase taxes. In other words, they have said, `We can't tell you what we are going to do. We will have this commission of audit. When we have the commission of audit&mdash;from independent people, of course&mdash;we will know exactly what we are going to do.' In each case, it has resulted in these swingeing cuts in expenditure and increased taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it would be in this case. If the Leader of the Opposition were being really honest with the Australian people in his so-called headland speech tonight, the speech would probably be called `Cape Tribulation' for the great affliction it would impose on the Australian people&mdash;especially on the so-called battlers whom the opposition so cynically claims to represent.</PARA>

It was contained in that speech plagiarising Des Moore by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, when he got up, as the one policy announcement, the one proposition that he put forward as his response to the federal budget. He wrapped himself in the cloak that he loves to wrap himself in of deep knowledge of the budgeting processes of the Commonwealth. Naturally, one would be tremendously impressed. Naturally, all things are new that he proposes. Naturally, the government, of course, has failed to implement any of the suggestions that have been put forward&mdash;which are, after all, just the list he got from Des Moore of commonsense propositions in terms of accounting processes as opposed to his `uncommon' sense propositions in terms of what cuts he wanted to put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>

As to the impacts of demographic change on Commonwealth outlays and how to make provision for them, I should just suggest that he read through the budget statements as they go through, for example, all the family policies that we have put in place, the assessments which are placed on where we see the development of families going, the $12.6 billion that are put in to deal with their problems.</PARA></TALK.START>

There has now been undertaken for some considerable time, associated with COAG, a roles and responsibility review on precisely these matters.

Unlike the states, the federal government has policies on CSOs and, might I say, a proud record of delivering them. We have introduced competition but retained the universal telephone access and the standard letter rate across Australia.

Honourable members would be aware that AIM has already acquired substantial investment from Cox Communications and John Fairfax Inc. In addition, it has been able to secure programming and financial contributions from CNN and Nickelodeon to build up those two channels&mdash;the two channels being the news channel and the combined children's/entertainment channel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would invite all members of this House to take the opportunity next time they are in Sydney to visit the ABC's Gore Hill studios and look at the new premises which have been put together by the ABC to provide the news channel. I was impressed by the quality of the facilities. I understand that this particular newsroom will be only the fourth in the world to be using complete digital technology from go to whoa. That is something for which the ABC and its commercial partners should be commended</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIM is currently negotiating with a number of distribution mediums to distribute their pay TV services. I understand commercial negotiations are continuing with Galaxy, Foxtel and Optus Vision. AIM is looking at a start-up date of 1 September this year for its two channels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would understand that the government has placed a pretty onerous local Australian content requirement on those two channels, and we think that, given the ABC's past performance in providing good quality programming, we can look forward to the start-up of these two channels. The government's support for this can be contrasted with the views of Senator Alston, the opposition's spokesperson, on pay TV. Senator Alston, in one media performance, made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To have a very substantial news channel as the ABC is proposing in pay TV must inevitably have serious consequences for the quality of its free-to-air services.</PARA>
<PARA>So Senator Alston on that occasion had very serious concerns about the ABC being involved in pay, yet he is the very senator who moved the amendment in the Senate that forced the ABC to be involved in pay TV. Just like everything else that Senator Alston has said on media policy he continues to be incoherent and inconsistent, and we look forward to a new spokesperson some time soon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this matter of public importance debate, let us first of all be clear about what is under discussion. It is not Aboriginal heritage, it is not Professor Cheryl Saunders and it is not Doreen Kartinyeri; it is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and his responsibility as minister for the fair and just administration of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and for what he has done, as a consequence of his action, to Aboriginal heritage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question, Minister, is: did you consider the evidence before you made your judgment on Hindmarsh Island, or is it true that you made up your mind irrespective of the evidence? Minister, did you ever have it in your mind not to ban the bridge? There were 400 representations, none of which you saw and none of which your staff member could have read in the short time that was available to her. Indeed, Justice O'Loughlin found that you had not considered the evidence. His judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, in my opinion, the evidence that had been placed before the court in these proceedings has shown, as a matter of probability, that the Minister did not give any "<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">consideration</EMPHASIS>" to the representations at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister, you said you made up your mind on the Saturday morning, 9 July, to ban the Hindmarsh Island bridge. What evidence do we have that you made your mind up after considering all the evidence? We have none, because you have produced none. But we have lots of evidence to suggest that you had already made up your mind before the Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, there is the fax on 7 July to the Office of Legislative Drafting confirming that the declaration would be for 25 years. It is true that Justice O'Loughlin has considered this, but let us consider it a little bit further, shall we? How on 7 July, if you did not make up your mind until 9 July, could your office fax to the draftsperson that the declaration would be for 25 years? Presumably, Minister, because declarations are usually for 25 years. Is that true? Minister, when we go back to your previous two declarations, what do we find? Twenty years and five years. So, if this was just a draft declaration in case you had to make it, why did we not go by past precedents?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something else. Is it not true that ATSIC had recommended a ban for four years on this Hindmarsh Island issue on 7 July? Here we have previous declarations made for 20 and five years, ATSIC recommends four; and what does the minister do: he puts out a draft that says the declaration will be for 25 years. This is somebody who has not made up his mind. Did he ask for two drafts, one maybe for five or 10 and one for 25? No, just the one for 25. That is the first piece of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, there are I believe five statutory declarations&mdash;and I am sure another member could produce the three if you would like them tabled&mdash;which state that on Friday night, 8 July, at an Aboriginal ball a statement was made that the Hindmarsh Island bridge would be stopped, the information coming either from you or from your office. How could that announcement be made at an Aboriginal ball if you had not conveyed that information? Was the person who said it not telling the truth? Why would anybody get up in front of a ball and say that if it were not the truth? There are five statutory declarations. The person supposed to have made the declaration has not denied it&mdash;and funny, Minister, I have not really heard you deny it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, we have the conversation with Dean Brown&mdash;do you remember that?&mdash;last Thursday. That was the absolute proof.

That was your defence on Thursday to the allegations made against you. What did Premier Dean Brown say? He said, `I was so convinced that the minister had made up his mind that I called the Prime Minister and tried to speak to him.' So much for Thursday's defence. In conclusion, you made up your mind before seeing the evidence. In fact, you had never any other intention but to ban the bridge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at something even a little more serious than this, and that is the declaration itself. When we look at the declaration, the story becomes curiouser and curiouser. First of all, we have the declaration that you are to sign faxed from your Canberra office to your home in Sydney. It is faxed there. You get the fax and you sign it with your signature to send it back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens to this fax in your home, Minister? It has disappeared. It has been suggested that the baby ate it. Is this the way you conduct your official business? Do you have a dog? If you have a dog, do we conclude that the dog could have eaten it as well? An official fax disappears from your home. What is more, there is not one fax log record to show what time that fax arrived. What happens next? The minister has signed it, then it gets lost. But it is faxed before it is lost back to the Canberra office with the date and time on it. This is the second record. We have lost the first; now we have got a record as it goes back to the Canberra office. What does the Canberra office do with it? It cuts the top off it.

Minister, you are aware that you are talking here about a $175 million deal, the developers are talking litigation and you have discussed the litigation with the Prime Minister. So you know what is at stake, but your office cuts the tops off the faxes. You then fax the mutilated copy off to the Gazette. What does your office then do with that fax it has just faxed off? It loses it. It loses the next fax. The lawyers asked for it, appealed for evidence, and no-one can find it.

<PARA>So much for that defence. Then there was Dean Brown, but we know what happened to that defence. We also have the minister's statement that the case is under appeal. Is it not true that the reason the case is under appeal has nothing to do with any of the things we have discussed? That is a particularly spurious defence. The fourth defence is probably the most pathetic of all&mdash;that is, in attacking the minister the coalition is attacking Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, Minister, we have your failure and refusal to look at the contradictory evidence. Surely, it is important for the minister that, when Aboriginal people rediscover their traditions and culture that have been lost through dispossession, forced resettlement and migration, they discover the truth. To suggest otherwise is to debase those traditions and that culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any person interested in the truth and anyone concerned with the integrity of Aboriginal culture and its preservation would surely want such claims investigated. Yet an investigation has been denied, even condemned, by you, Minister. To dismiss the concerns of Dorothy and Dulcie Wilson, Bertha Gollan and other senior Aboriginal women as unimportant and irrelevant must be one of the strangest sleights of hand perpetuated by a minister who claims to support all Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the guise of supporting Aboriginal people, you have taken sides and you have deliberately disempowered one group of Aboriginal women. Certainly, Dorothy Wilson must be today contemplating the high personal cost she has had to pay. She might ask: why is the minister not prepared to speak out against her vilification? Why is he so silent about what has  happened to the most defenceless of Aboriginal people? What does the minister suggest is her motive for speaking out&mdash;money, glory, fame? Perhaps, Minister, it is the desire for truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no judgment about the truth as Dorothy Wilson believes it or as Doreen Kartinyeri believes it, and neither should you, Minister.

The fact is that on every single occasion that the coalition has a choice between defending the heritage values of indigenous Australians and supporting other interests&mdash;whether they be developers or someone else&mdash;the coalition supports the bulldozer above the rights of indigenous people. We have seen a tawdry track record from the coalition in dealing with this Hindmarsh Island bridge issue within the parliament and outside the parliament. In the course of my remarks, I am going to say something about the opposition's conduct in dealing with that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, let me put on the public record that my actions in this matter, in issuing the declaration to protect the area from desecration, have been supported by no lesser authority than the Commonwealth parliament. Both houses of the Commonwealth parliament have endorsed my actions and have refused to support the disallowance motion moved and supported by the coalition in both houses. I can say to indigenous people that, when I speak, I speak with the support of the parliament. They ought not to think that because the coalition in this place refuses to stand up for their interests the rest of us do not care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and are not prepared to speak out and stand up for what is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pose a challenge to any member of this House, any member of the press gallery or any member of the public to read the judgment of Justice O'Loughlin in relation to the heritage declaration and, as appropriate, read the transcript of the court case that gave rise to the judgment. I want to say that, almost without exception, every single issue that has been canvassed extensively by really only two major media outlets&mdash;the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> and Network Ten&mdash;and by a few columnists like Piers Ackerman, was received, considered and rejected by Justice O'Loughlin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give you five or six examples of the slurs that have been issued against me and against indigenous people in this matter and the way they were independently considered by the court and rejected. I stand here on the floor of the parliament with the support of the parliament having gone through a judicial inquiry. I have been there. My actions have been before the court, scrutinised to the most minute detail and I have walked through that process and emerged with my integrity intact and my actions in respect of the matters challenged by the coalition vindicated by no less an authority than the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take members through some issues. One issue that has been raised in the media is that I issued a declaration for a different period than that recommended in advice to me. Yes, this is true, but this is also a matter that has been considered by the Federal Court of Australia. Mr Justice O'Loughlin made it clear that the decision maker in this matter was not some bureaucrat and not some staff member but me as the relevant federal minister. It was my decision. How did I issue a declaration different to some of the advice put to me by some of the bureaucrats? I had regard to the Saunders report. If you look at the Saunders report, you will see that she did not support a declaration for a limited period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For days on end we have had this slur against former members of my staff&mdash;people who are not in a position to defend themselves and who have gone on to other careers&mdash;that somehow or other they mutilated documents to destroy evidence. That was raised in front of Mr Justice O'Loughlin. Every word and every minute detail on the timing and date on which faxes were sent and how documents were dealt with was raised in front of Mr Justice O'Loughlin. Every single scrap of evidence that has been hurled publicly by some of the columnists in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> and by some of those on Network Ten has been raised in the Federal Court. What did Mr Justice O'Loughlin decide? He decided that I had not prejudged the matter. He decided that that evidence was not to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been alleged in the course of public debate on this issue and supported by the coalition that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in some way provided improper advice to the applicants in this matter. Mr Justice O'Loughlin considered that too. As the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) ought to know and certainly the member for Hindmarsh ought to know, he rejected any impropriety on the part of ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said consistently that I prejudged this matter. All this nonsense that I somehow predetermined the matter was argued like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Hills</EMPHASIS> in the Federal Court. It went on for hours and hours. Members of my staff were cross-examined. What did the judge say? The judge said that I had behaved properly in this matter. It was alleged in no lesser an authority than the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, I think on Saturday, that the fact that I had caused the preparation of a draft declaration was somehow prejudging the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice O'Loughlin considered this and he said that I had behaved prudently. He made it clear that I was working to a tight time frame. If the South Australian Premier had said to me, `Look Robert, we will have a cooling off period. We will call off the threat,' then things might have been a bit different. But that was not what it was about. My best recollection of what the judge said in relation to this matter was that it would be a dereliction of my duty if I did not act in such a way as to ensure that there was no gap between the expiry of a section 9 declaration and the issue of a section 10 declaration. He said that I used a prudent course of action in ensuring the preparation of a draft declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> knew all that.

Did the minister's office give instructions to ATSIC to change the declaration from four years to 25 years? If the minister's office did give instructions to ATSIC the day before the declaration was issued, why was it worded that the declaration will be for 25 years? Why was there no `if'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is going to go out of here because he will not answer any of these questions. That just shows that he is sure short of the stuff in the middle of the stomach&mdash;absolutely gutless. The first point is that the instruction for declaration said, `You will issue that declaration for 25 years and you will put a map on the declaration.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter I wish to raise is that the minister said he made the declaration on Saturday, 9 July. All the evidence, he says, points that way. However, Premier Brown rang him on the morning of 9 July, and the phone call finished at about 11.08 Eastern Standard Time. Talk about giving somebody a cooling-off period! After the Premier of the state had given his best view, the minister gave him a cooling-off period of seven minutes. He then rang up his adviser and said, `Make the declaration.' The truth of the matter is that he made that decision days before. Everybody knows that he made it days before, including Mrs Doreen Kartinyeri who announced it at a ball in Adelaide the previous night. It is absolute nonsense for the minister to get up here and say that those things had not been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take this minister not only to the matter I have just raised, or to the matter of the auto scissors cutting the top of the fax off, or to the matter that he has a whiteboard fax machine which manages to dispose of faxes either into the nappy or out with the baby's bathwater, but also to the very fact that this matter started back on 9 May because some men from the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee asked 15 Ngarrindjeri women from Murray Bridge to come to a meeting. The purpose of the meeting was because, in their view, the report done by anthropologist Neale Draper&mdash;and the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) has a copy of that report, she was quoting from it here in November; I do not have a copy but she has&mdash;was not good enough for them to get a declaration made. That was the purpose of the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they invited 15 women along and said, `We've got a lady called Doreen Kartinyeri and she is going to tell you what the women's business is about.' She told them that Hindmarsh Island was a place where white men's babies had been aborted and so forth. So they wrote a letter to the minister on that basis without describing the exactitude of that. They went to the other side of the island and the people from the Aboriginal legal movement said, `That's not good enough.' So they wrote some more words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know what those words are? I think the words are in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 27 May. The words are direct quotes out of the Draper report. Who wrote the Draper report? A man. That was the first letter. All that stuff went to the minister. So the minister had in his ken a letter which quoted a man about secret women's business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kartinyeri is seminal to this debate because, as Cheryl Saunders said in her report, `She is a Ngarrindjeri elder whose knowledge about the women's business central to this report came from her grandmother and her Aunt Rosie, her mother's older sister.' The second invaluable point in this discussion is that three days later, in a letter dated the 12th that the minister had and still has, Doreen Kartinyeri said two things. She said, `I have recently become aware of the exact place to which this women's business refers.' Of course, it was Hindmarsh Island. She quoted three sources: her grandmother, long since dead; Laura Kartinyeri, currently known as Nanna Laura; and her Aunt Rosie, who died in 1981. So there was only one person alive who was the source of her information. Remember, she was quoted in the Saunders report as `the person who is central to this report'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Cheryl Saunders was asked in court in December last whether she had ever seen the letter of 12 May that the minister had, she answered that she was very surprised and had never seen it in her life. When you read the 56 pages of the Saunders report, Nanna Laura&mdash;as I will call her&mdash;is never mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what happens? You cannot blame Cheryl Saunders unless she was told by somebody and did not do the work. Maybe you have to think about the evidence that Doreen Kartinyeri gave to Cheryl Saunders. But the one person who knew&mdash;and his office knew&mdash;after he read the report, albeit in a couple of days, which he received on 7 July, that the only person alive who could have verified the women's business was never asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if you call that doing the job in detail and changing 140 years of anthropological history on the basis of it then that is the sort of detail that this minister went to. And he will not answer that question. He had two letters&mdash;one on 9 May and one on 12 May&mdash;which played a formative part in his appointing Cheryl Saunders, which he did on 23 May. He took notice, presumably, of the fact that a woman should do the thing, because the letters to him referred to women's business. When Cheryl Saunders' report came up, the one woman on earth who could have verified the truth or otherwise of this thing was not asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for this minister, a woman by the name of Dorothy Wilson was at that first meeting. She signed the first letter saying that she thought it was a sacred place and so forth. But on her way home that night she thought more about it and it worried her. She went to see Nanna Laura&mdash;Mrs Laura Kartinyeri, who was 88 years old last year and perfectly healthy at that time&mdash;and she asked her about the women. Remember, Nanna Laura is the most senior elder and known amongst the Ngarrindjeri people as that. Dorothy Wilson asked her whether it was true, and she was told that it was rubbish. The old lady had never heard of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say a couple of things before I close. This issue has for a long time battled the consciences of these women who have now come out after a long time, because they realised it would cause disruption amongst the people in the Ngarrindjeri group. But they have at least put honour back into this operation. I have to say that, if this minister is not an accomplice in this operation, he is probably compliant in some sort of conspiracy. He has not answered the questions that he should have answered. I did not hear him answer one single question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is it that Saunders did not get near the anthropologists in the Adelaide museum? How is it that the only anthropologist was Deane Fergie, who was putting forward a representation for one of the protagonists? How is it that the minister made a recommendation for a declaration or made the declaration when only four women had ever heard of this? It could have been four; it may have been only one. How is it that last week the senior anthropologist at the Adelaide Museum came out and said that these things are blowing in from the desert?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does the minister answer these questions? How is it that he did not notice that Cheryl Saunders was wrong in saying that Mr Justice Jacobs' recent report had said something about women's business when, of course, we all know that it did not?

She has been led down the garden path by the member for Barker, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Mayo. These people are responsible for a despicable attack on people who are not present in this House and able to defend themselves. Yet continually they make these attacks. It is worth pointing out a comment about the member for Barker by Alex Kennedy in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">City Messenger</EMPHASIS> of 24 April 1995. He said:</PARA>

He made statements about Doreen Kartinyeri, and he made statements about Cheryl Saunders. Cheryl Saunders is an interesting person, because she was the person chosen by the government to provide the independent advice, a person who has been attacked by the opposition. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> on 27 May 1994, Justice Maurice O'Loughlin said about this person:</PARA>

<PARA>The main elements of the proposed works are the implementation of a staged program of internal refurbishment providing tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety with the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment and providing office accommodation which meets current data and communications needs, and the refurbishment of areas surplus to high commission requirements for leasing to state governments and other agencies.

There is a need to retain Australia House, London, as the focal point of Australia's representational activities in the United Kingdom. There is a need to refurbish the interior of Australia House, London, as proposed by the Overseas Property Group, as much of the existing office accommodation is in poor condition and does not meet the needs of a modern working environment.

There are some legal impediments to the committee conducting hearings overseas which cannot be dealt with by simply amending the act.

The configuration of the building, with a well in the middle and the matter of the windows, makes it virtually impossible to do that. Even with this work, there will still be several vacant floors. We have been concerned about that vacant accommodation. The real difficulty we face is that the office market in London is oversupplied. We had to spend $14 million to bring those three floors up to rentable standard. A real difficulty we face is that we have to spend quite a lot of money on those buildings to bring them up to a standard for letting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thesis I was putting to the House before question time was that as a consequence of the increase in taxation, not only in this Medicare Levy Bill but also in respect of the Keating government's increases in tax in previous budgets and this budget, many more families are going to be forced out of continuing private health insurance. That will put greater pressure on the public hospital sector and will increase costs. Therefore, the merry-go-round will continue with increasing demand on taxpayers' funds to sustain Medicare. The government has produced a giant haemorrhage and that can only get worse under the government's policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trajectory of this government in budgets up to the current budget has been to increase taxes in Australia, despite a promise not to increase taxes, by around $3 billion a year. I outlined those taxes before question time. In the budget before the House, taxes will increase by $2.4 billion in 1995-96, rising to $7.8 billion in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members&mdash;I notice that no government members are here other than the parliamentary secretary and another minister who is always attentive to my comments in the House, and I appreciate that&mdash;of some of the individual tax measures in this current budget, apart from the raising of the Medicare levy. The first is to increase company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, which will take $3,970 million out of the private sector&mdash;money to invest in jobs and in the expansion of business and industry in Australia&mdash;over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy will raise $1,010 million over four years, which will come out of the pockets of all Australians&mdash;PAYE taxpayers, wage earners, small businesses, families and farmers. That amount of money would be otherwise spent by those families in looking after themselves, being self-sufficient and, for many of them, continuing to pay private health insurance instead of being totally reliant on public health schemes, at a greater cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of sales tax on building materials will raise a total of $1,015 million over four years. Again, let us pause to reflect where that money is going to come from. Predominantly, it will come from young people who are trying to get their first home, who will now have to pay hundreds of dollars&mdash;according to one of the Labor members during question time, at least $1,500&mdash;per modest home for wholesales sales tax on building materials not presently covered by the wholesales sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of passenger motor vehicles used predominantly by families, by battlers in Australia, by small business, again I remind members on the other side, the sales tax proposals in this budget propose to raise $1,470 million over the next four years. The consequences of taking those vast sums of money out of families, out of the productive side of the economy, out of small business are clear&mdash;that can only result in less investment, less savings and more demands on the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that that is the case when you consider the tax base that we already have and the fact that these people have had to suffer high interest rates during a massive recession and now regretfully a return to higher interest rates with three interest rate hikes over the past 12 months. If, as I fear, we follow the trend of the American economy, and with our huge debt and therefore the forces at work on the Australian economy, we are going to find, perhaps in the very short term, a slight dip in interest rates followed by a rise in interest rates as this government, if it is still in power&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;grapples with the levers of managing this economy in the clumsy way that it has over the past 12 or 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reminding the House of the sorts of statements that this government has made to the Australian people over many years. In the next few weeks as the election draws nearer and Australians have the opportunity to reflect and cast their vote on the sort of government they want for the future, not so much for themselves but for their children and grandchildren, I remind them of these sorts of statements and ask them to make a judgment on their own. </PARA>

<PARA>The outcome&mdash;the government has admitted the budget will not be in surplus. It is selling off assets to fudge the balance of account. Within a year, Labor had broken its promise to deliver the second round of income tax cuts on 1 January 1996 and in fact introduced a range of new taxes, that I have outlined, in the last two budgets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And justified, as the Assistant Treasurer says. You would be interested to know that the Medicare levy receipts, as a proportion of Medicare outlays, have fallen from over 30 per cent in 1988-89 to an expected 24 per cent in 1994-95. This increase in the Medicare levy does not even make up for that fall; it only partially makes up for that decline. We had lectures from members opposite about fiscal responsibility and about responsibility and the management of the resources of the nation. What sort of responsibility do they show whenever they have to make a hard decision, such as a very small increase in the Medicare levy? What do they do? They run away from it and then they want to vote against it here and in the other place. That is a disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm did not produce a single argument to support his position. What did we have from him? We had from him belated support for Medicare. After five election losses by the coalition parties in which Medicare was a central issue and in which health policy was a central issue, they finally recognise that the Australian people actually like Medicare, the Australian people support Medicare, the Australian people think Medicare is a very good policy. It is a lot for them to swallow, given their philosophical predilection, especially the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). It was very difficult for him to swallow. He said, `I support Medicare.' That was one of the hardest things he has ever had to do in politics. Given his new right philosophical basis&mdash;he does not believe in anything universal, especially universal health care&mdash;it was a very difficult thing for him to do. He is so desperate to win government that he said it. It was like his attempted reversal of his statements on multiculturalism and ethnic affairs. Never mind, we will discuss that at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people know that any embracing of Medicare by the opposition is very reluctant and is not based on any philosophical commitment to the principles of Medicare. The first opportunity members of the opposition get, whatever excuse they get&mdash;if they were to get into government&mdash;they would run away from the universal nature of Medicare. Remember when Malcolm Fraser went to the people in 1975. He said, `We will retain Medibank.' Within months of getting into office, Medibank was out the window&mdash;the universal health system was out the window. We had to bring it back in 1983 in a new form, to sustain the health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the shadow minister to talk in here about the virtues of a health system and to say that the minister is mistaken in her policies because of the issues of private health insurance, which do not concern this bill, is amazing. Let me address those questions at this level. We will listen to the shadow minister in some serious way, and the Australian people will listen to the shadow minister and the opposition in some serious way, when they come up with some proposal. Every time this idea of a policy free zone is raised, the opposition leader chuckles and thinks it is a big joke. If you think it is a big joke not to have a policy on this private health area&mdash;and they have none; they have ditched the previous one; God knows what it is now&mdash;and then to get up and say that there are some problems in private health insurance which the minister has not dealt with is a joke. The minister has pushed through this chamber and through the dreaded Senate a bill to put into place a new system to deal with the issues concerning private health insurance. Let us not hear any more nonsense from the shadow minister about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to this fundamental point: the moderates in the Liberal Party had better start standing up, because there will not be any left. Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, you are one of those moderates. What has happened to you? You have been knocked off for preselection. What about the other moderate who is here now, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly)? He has been knocked off for preselection. The way things are going, the moderates in the Liberal Party will be able to meet in a telephone booth. That is how bad things are in the Liberal Party. They have knocked off all the moderate members, and then tonight we are to hear a speech about how they are going to move the party to the centre ground. All these hard, New Right people have suddenly discovered the centre ground. If you believe that, you will believe anything.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the comments of the honourable member for Curtin, who is in the chair at the moment. He raised the question about the limit to the levy and said that it would be logical for the government to go on increasing the levy until it covered the whole cost of health services. With respect, those comments are based on a misunderstanding. At no time has the government ever stated that the intention of the Medicare levy was to cover all the health costs. From the beginning we recognised that the Medicare levy was only a contribution towards health costs. It continues to be so. Therefore, the levy is only making part of that contribution towards the fundamental cost. Unlike the opposition, we understand that additional measures are required in order to raise sufficient funds for health and human services&mdash;fundamental issues in social justice, health and human services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to understand what the social wage is about. Health and human services are the fundamental elements of the social wage. It is very interesting that in a 20-minute speech attacking the Prime Minister yesterday the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the words `social wage' a number of times, but he did not explain a single thing about it&mdash;not what it means and what it is all about. He was very happy to use the word `battlers'. When it comes to serious policy and to discussing the issues of social justice and the social wage&mdash;the human services component of the social wage and the health component of the social wage&mdash;what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He does not have a clue. He did not talk about it. He left it to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), to try to say something about it. For 15 or 20 minutes the Leader of the Opposition attacked the Prime Minister personally about this issue, but he did not in any way say what it really means or give his understanding of it. If you go to the record and look for the two words `social justice' under the words `John Howard' you cannot find anything.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, Mr Deputy Speaker, the proceedings are not being broadcast. Let me talk about the comments of the member for Stirling. He raised no real issues in relation to this matter. I am not sure whether he or another member of the opposition who came afterwards attempted to attack the minister personally. I considered that an outrage. He tried to attack the minister personally by somehow implying that the minister had used her influence to have an operational procedure done without waiting very long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make these points about this matter: firstly, it is true that the minister underwent a procedure. She did so while she was Premier of Western Australia. It was done in a private hospital, not in a public hospital. She certainly did not push her way through to the top of the queue. She paid for the operation herself. She chose this course of action in order to avoid putting any additional burden on the public health system. This is the position which a number of Australians have taken. For whatever reason, they have chosen not to have private health insurance but to pay the full cost in private hospitals of operations and the like. Whichever member raised this issue&mdash;the member for Stirling or another member&mdash;it was disgraceful to raise the issue in the context of this debate. The minister acted in a totally honourable fashion. The government is not interested in these personal attacks of the kind that we are getting from the opposition. We are interested in getting on with governing this country. I know you all think that at the first sign of our going up in the polls we will call an election, but that is not the issue at all. Our main concern is to govern this country well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good governance, as the honourable member says. In the area of human services and health, as in a number of other social areas, we have developed volumes of policy. We have developed a large range of programs, vast networks of administration that are delivering the policies and even in certain cases forcing conservative, reactionary state liberal coalition governments into social policy. In some cases we have had to drag them. A good example of that is the fact that we have had to drag the Kennett government into the child-care system, after 2 1/2 years, and we also tried to drag the Fahey government into the scheme. It took the defeat of that government before New South Wales would become involved in the program. This is the attitude towards social programs which the conservatives have had and will always have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of health, we should have been developing a bipartisan approach. Instead, we have had from the shadow minister determination to oppose this measure. I regret that. It is a sorry indication that the conservatives, the New Right in the opposition, are increasingly getting the upper hand. They are not interested in responsible decision making; they simply want to block a number of measures in the budget with the idea of using that as an electoral tool. They will not escape this proposal, because the Australian people in general accept the fact that Medicare is a positive system and that this increase is a small, necessary increase which will assist in the overall operation of the health system&mdash;including the new programs which were announced in the budget, especially a program to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other programs in a range of areas, including programs directed towards people from non-English speaking backgrounds and people with particular problems. All these programs will be very positive and I believe that increasing the Medicare levy by this small amount, while not paying for all these programs, will help to pay for some. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a very responsible measure and should be totally supported by any party which claims that it would have any responsibility in government. I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition is opposing it, and totally reject the argument of those opposite. </PARA>

<PARA>The bills will modify the sales tax law to give effect to certain announcements in the 1995-96 budget. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Passenger motor vehicles</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills will increase the rate of sales tax applying to non-luxury passenger motor vehicles from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. The rate of sales tax applying to the portion of the value of luxury passenger motor vehicles below the luxury threshold will also be increased in line with the rate for non-luxury passenger motor vehicles. These changes will take effect from budget night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax applying to non-luxury passenger motor vehicles was reduced from the general rate as an anti-cyclical measure in the 1992 One Nation statement. Strong growth in the economy has removed any need for the concessional rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gain to revenue of these measures is likely to be $18 million for 1994-95, $330 million for 1995-96, $355 million for 1996-97, $380 million for 1997-98 and $405 million for 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Safes, musical instruments and ornaments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills make clear that safes, musical instruments including pianos and other keyboards, and ornaments in the nature of bric-a-brac are not entitled to the concessional rate of sales tax applicable to household furniture. These changes will take effect from budget night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The modifications are necessary following recent disputes where taxpayers have claimed that these goods, which have long been considered taxable at the general rate, should be treated as furniture and, therefore, subject to the concessional rate of 11 per cent. The government considers it necessary to legislate to ensure that these goods continue to be taxed at the general rate. These modifications will prevent the potential for revenue leakage rather than directly increasing revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Model aircraft</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax law provides an exemption from sales tax for aircraft. A recent court decision has resulted in this exemption being extended to model aircraft capable of flight. This is at odds with the longstanding policy on the treatment of model aircraft. The bills will ensure that all model aircraft are again taxed at the general rate of sales tax, along with other toys. This modification will take effect from budget night. It has not been possible to quantify the gain to the revenue for this measure. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Scaffolding components, wall and floor safes, shelving systems</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills will reverse the effect of recent court decisions, which have expanded the scope of sales tax exemptions for building materials beyond what was originally intended, with regard to scaffolding components, wall and floor safes and shelving systems. That is, the bills will ensure that these goods, which have long been accepted as being subject to sales tax, will not be eligible for sales tax exemptions. These changes will take effect from budget night. These modifications will prevent the potential for revenue leakage rather than directly increasing revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Building materials</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills will make certain categories of currently exempt building materials taxable at the concessional rate, which will be 12 per cent when the modification comes into effect on 1 July 1995. This measure will apply the 12 per cent rate to a wide range of building materials used in the completion of buildings, including goods such as wall and floor tiles, plaster, taps and nozzles, timber floor coverings, paints, putties, fillers, wallpaper, builders hardware and some items of prefabricated joinery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gain to the revenue of the measures is likely to be $215 million for 1995-96, $245 million for 1996-97, $265 million for 1997-98 and $290 million for 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recycled paper</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain goods made from recycled paper are exempt from sales tax provided the goods are made entirely from recycled paper. The government considers that this sales tax exemption is inefficient and likely to impede efficient industry development. The bills, therefore, remove the sales tax exemption for goods made from recycled paper. This modification will take effect from l November 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gain to revenue of these measures is likely to be $7 million for 1995-96, $13 million for 1996-97, $14 million for 1997-98 and $15 million for 1998-99. Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bills to the House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995 and cognate bills, together with the previous bill relating to the increase in the Medicare levy and subsequent bills relating to taxation which the government will deal with in this place this week, are in effect the mechanism by which this government commits electoral fraud on the people of Australia. In this legislation we have an increase in sales tax on two items about which the government had intimated and indicated there would be no such increase; namely, an increase in tax on cars and also an increase in tax on building products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) pointed out, we find in these bills an increase in sales tax in a number of areas: an increase in sales tax payable on passenger motor vehicles to the general rate of 21 per cent, up from 16 per cent; a modification of the sales tax law to remove the exemption for a range of building materials which will become taxable now at the rate of 12 per cent; and a series of other tax increases or modifications to make it clear that tax applies to free standing safes, musical instruments, ornaments, model aircraft, scaffolding components, wall and floor safes, racking and shelving systems; and last, but not least, a modification in sales tax law to remove the sales tax exemption for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate to the House that the coalition will vote against, will oppose, those increases in sales tax on building products and on cars. We will be voting against these items because, in our opinion, the implementation of these proposals represents an electoral fraud on the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded in this debate of a conversation that I had with my daughter recently. She said to me in her childhood way, `What does it mean when someone says to you, Dad, "A man is as good as his word"?' I said, `Well, it's about being honest. "A man is as good as his word" means he'll keep his word and he'll be honest.' I said by way of example, `If I said to you, "I'll give you $5 extra pocket money if you'll help clean up your room and help clean up around the place," but when it came time to pay it to you the next week I said, "No, you've done all the work but I'm not going to pay it. I'm going to take it back," would that be honest?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She said, `No, of course not.' I said, `If I gave you a doll and then I said later, "Listen, I'm taking it back. I gave it to you but it is not really yours to keep. You've had it for a day. I said you could have it but now I am going to take it back," would that be honest?' She said, `No, of course not, Dad.' So I said, `Well, that is what it means when we say, "A man is as good as his word." When something is said in relation to a certain proposal or proposition, it means that that word will be kept.' What we can say in relation to this legislation is that a man is as good as his word&mdash;but we see that the word is simply not being kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me deal with some of the actual proposals in the legislation; first of all, the increase in sales tax on cars. Let us go back to the famous One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 26 February 1992. In the ministerial statement that the Prime Minister stood at this dispatch box here and delivered to this place and to the people of Australia, he had this to say about motor vehicles:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>permanently&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">lowered to 15 per cent&mdash;a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries.</PARA>
<PARA>He said there would be a permanent lowering of sales tax on motor vehicles from 20 to 15 per cent. What does this piece of legislation propose? It proposes that we increase the sales tax on motor vehicles from 16 to 21 per cent. When we ask about the impact of this, we do not have to go any further than what the Prime Minister himself said in February 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800.</PARA>
<PARA>So the impact on ordinary purchasers of motor vehicles of this particular measure, if the prices are about the same as they were in 1992, is an increased cost of some $800 on a new Falcon or a new Holden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just part of the increasing cost of transport under this government. We have seen fuel excise rise from some 6c to 34c per litre. A survey by the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria showed that the cost of running a car over the last year has gone up for a private vehicle by some $13 and for a commercial vehicle by some $48. This is a measure which will have an immediate impact once it is introduced&mdash;if it is not defeated elsewhere&mdash;on ordinary purchasers of cars. My local dealer in Holden Commodores in Doncaster has already said that he has detected a marked shift in the attitude of buyers in relation to this particular measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a country that has an aged vehicle fleet&mdash;a country whose vehicle fleet is much older than those in most of the developed world&mdash;this measure will make it more difficult for people to buy cars. What about the environmental concerns? If we have already got an ageing fleet and this proposal makes it more difficult to buy cars, then we can expect that fewer people will buy cars, which will add to the environmental problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a question about this in parliament in the last week, the Prime Minister said that no-one in the motor industry should be surprised by this. No-one would be surprised because it is a complete reversal of a policy from the Prime Minister, and that is what everyone&mdash;those in the motor industry and elsewhere&mdash;has come to expect; that when he says one thing he will actually turn around and do another. The word `permanent' has no realistic meaning at all in the language of the Prime Minister of this country. The word `permanent' becomes meaningless; it becomes a word that means temporary. The moral of this story, if we go back to taking a man at his word, is that the word of the Prime Minister of Australia that something is permanent means that it is temporary. So much for the word of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The next proposal deals with the increase in sales tax on building materials. Prior to the 1993 election we were told over and over again in this place and on every media outlet, on radio and television stations around the nation, that we did not need an increase in sales tax. The Prime Minister and members of the government campaigned the length and breadth of this nation saying, `We don't need increases in sales tax and in particular we don't need a goods and services tax.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember the advertisements that were played on television stations night after night of a cash register with 15 per cent jingling up? The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) remembers them very well. The whole purport of those advertisements was, `We're not going to have a GST. We're not going to have a 15 per cent increase in GST. We're not going to have in any way an increase in sales tax.' The one clear, unambiguous message that came from the government, from the Prime Minister, from the Treasurer (Mr Willis), from the frontbench and from the backbench was that there would be no increase in sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1992, the Prime Minister said clearly, in words which one could hardly put a different meaning on, `What I am promising is not to put up tax.' If you look at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcripts, you will see that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) on 5 May rejected categorically any tax increases on the housing industry; as did the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, on 30 April 1992. `No sales tax on the building industry,' said the Deputy Prime Minister and the then Treasurer, `We're not going to do that. We promise the opposite, just like the Prime Minister said.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we make of the word of the Prime Minister? Can we take the man at his word? In this legislation a whole raft of items commonly used in the building industry are now going to be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. Let us just look at what those things are. Plaster, used in raw materials in construction and repair, and the ingredients for plaster mixes will all be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Builders' hardware such as nails, rivets, washers, screws, bolts and nuts will all be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. Every time a builder hammers a nail into a piece of wood&mdash;and how many nails go into building an extension to a house, let alone building a new house?&mdash;there will be a 12 per cent tax on that nail as well as on every bolt, nut and screw that goes into that building. At the present time some floor coverings are subject to tax, but all wall and floor tiles will now be subject to a 12 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far we have got the plaster going into raw materials in construction and repair, the nails, bolts, screws and nuts that hold together all the wood that goes into the building of a house and the wall and floor tiles that make up the construction of a house or a renovation going to be taxed. In addition to that, timber floor coverings and parquet blocks will also be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not enough, the list goes on: paints, putties and wallpaper will be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. So, if people are going to paint the bathroom or put up some wallpaper in the spare room, as of 1 July 1995 the Prime Minister will rip off from them another 12 per cent in sales tax. Not only that; taps, nozzles, tap handles or shower heads installed in houses will be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the tax is not going to stop at the residence. Office partitions, workstation panelling, fittings, accessories and attachments for office partitions and office workstations will also be taxed. Every time people in small business anywhere across Australia want to modify their premises, open a new office or in any way change the structure of their office, they will be taxed. This is another tax being put on small business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will probably hit most people if they are not buying a new house or doing general renovations? A 12 per cent tax on kitchen cupboards and other storage units. It sounded like the tax would just be on kitchen cupboards, which was bad enough, but all prefabricated timber cupboards, cabinets, storage units&mdash;including bathroom vanity units&mdash;and kitchens of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes are included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that most people do at some stage in the ownership of their house is to renovate their kitchen or bathroom. People save their money for months and years&mdash;years and years in some cases&mdash;to be able to renovate their house, their kitchen or their bathroom. What do we have here? We have a tax on that renovation&mdash;a 12 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is going to add to the cost of housing, not just new housing but also renovations. We had the Treasurer saying that this would only be about an extra $300. But in question time today he admitted, `Yes; well, that is actually on a very modest house.' About the only house it would add $300 to would be a doghouse. If we look at medium houses, the Treasurer says the increase will be in the order of $500 to $1,000. The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, told the Senate the other day that it would be about $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we get the real message when one of the backbenchers goes out and tries to actually deal with the constituents in his electorate. Today the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), in his local newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Examiner</EMPHASIS>, tried to defend this measure in front of the housing industry, the builders and the home owners of Page. I will read the whole of the three paragraphs so there is no question of my taking what he said out of context. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Member for Page, Harry Woods, has urged new home buyers to ask builders for itemised increases in building costs, because of an increase in sales tax on some items.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Woods said he was appalled that some home builders had been advising of increases of more than $3000 on a home worth about $75,000 and blaming the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Figures from the Home Building Industry and Treasury officials suggest it should be less than half that amount," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"There is no place for the `get rich quick' rip off merchants."</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer tried to say today that it would be ridiculous if builders were trying to rip off home purchasers and renovators, even before this measure came in, by adding on an extra $3,000. Of course, if they sign contracts now for houses to be built in July, August or September, naturally the builder will want to be building into that contract for renovations or a new home the extra sales tax that will be charged on those items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the telling thing about this is that the member for Page is saying not that it will be $3,000 but that it should be less than half that amount; not the $300 we were quoted by the Treasurer, or even the $800 he is conceding today, or the $1,000 that Senator Schacht, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, announced elsewhere, but that it should be&mdash;a hope&mdash;something less than $1,500. That, of course, gives us some idea of the real cost involved in these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kitchen builders see some problems: for example, some retired pensioners will have waited 30 years to get a new kitchen. To them it is a big deal if they can play one company against the other in order to save $300. These are real people out in the real world. We have had this debate about battlers and who represents them. Here we have pensioners who have saved for years and years and who look around for the cheapest quote so that they can get $300 off the cost of renovating their kitchen&mdash;and the government is going to rip them off somewhere between $300 and $1,500, according to the member for Page. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Werriwa can wave and say that this does not matter. When he goes back to his constituents and deals with them, how is he going to explain to them what the government is actually doing in relation to these building costs? What we have here is the government's GST on building materials. You know it and the people of Australia will know it as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have here a tax on services. Members should note the way in which this will actually operate. If somebody builds a kitchen&mdash;spending maybe a day or two or three, whatever it takes to build a kitchen, in the workshop&mdash;and then, as is commonly done, brings that kitchen into the home in components and spends just half a day or a day installing it, 12 per cent sales tax will be charged on the components brought in. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology says, `Not on the labour costs.' There will be a huge problem in differentiating between what is expended on labour&mdash;whether it is brought in or whether it is built on the spot&mdash;and what is expended on the actual products that go into the kitchen. This will add further disincentive to small business in this country, because it will add more compliance costs to their actual operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing and building approvals in Australia are falling. The government is adding to that by ripping off Australians with a further 12 per cent tax on building materials. This is the government's GST on building. It is nothing more or less than that. What is the moral in this? What can we say about taking a man at his word? When the Prime Minister says, `What I am promising is not to put up tax,' he actually means that he is going to put up tax. When he says one thing, he actually means another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reminds me of Lewis Carroll's old story, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Through the Looking Glass</EMPHASIS>. Humpty, who is a bad-tempered egg, says to Alice, `There's glory for you!' `I don't know what you mean by "glory",' Alice said. Humpty said, `I meant there's a nice knockdown argument for you!' `But "glory" doesn't mean a "nice knockdown argument",' Alice objected. `When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, `it means just what I choose it to mean&mdash;neither more nor less.' When the Prime Minister uses a word, it means just what he chooses it to mean&mdash;neither more nor less. But you can be assured that it will mean one thing one day and, if it suits him, it will mean another thing another day. There is only one more moral that we can draw from that story, and we all know what happened to Humpty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current measures have resulted in an increased cost of compliance by small business all the time. For example, the accountants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu pointed out that under the sales tax system companies are being `squeezed with 60- and 90-day payment terms by retailers'. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . wholesaler companies must remit wholesale tax to the ATO up to six weeks before they are paid by the retailer, thanks to a law unchanged since 1931.</PARA>
<PARA>They continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wholesalers are being forced not only to collect sales tax on behalf of the ATO but to fund the working capital of the largest retailing organisations in the country.</PARA>
<PARA>They indicate that that is forcing a number of companies into debt because of the way in which these archaic tax laws operate. These measures will only add to these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some measures in this bill that we will not be voting against. Those measures fall into two categories. What we are voting against in this place and in the other place are those fraudulent actions on behalf of this government in saying one thing in order to win an election and then coming in here afterwards and doing the opposite. We will not be opposing the measure relating to modifications in tax on safes, musical instruments and ornaments. This measure arose out of a decision of the Federal Court in Chubb Australia Ltd and the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, which clarified the law. Similarly, we will not be opposing the measure in relation to scaffolding, racking, shelving and wall and floor tiles, which arose out of the court decision in GKN Australia Ltd and the Federal Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final measure in this bill relates to the change in the tax status of recycled paper. The exemption which currently exists for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products came into operation in October 1989. The aim of the exemption was to encourage the recycling of paper. In June 1992 the federal government accepted that the exemption had had unforeseen consequences and should be narrowed to address problems that had arisen and to direct better the measure to environmental concerns. Accordingly, at that stage, the exemption was removed for facial and toilet tissue; certain books of paper, such as exercise books; and paper bags. The government provided some transitional assistance to a number of small tissue manufacturers who claimed they had made investments based on the introduction of the tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the then minister for the environment and the Environment Protection Agency determined that recycling should be only one criterion for assessing the environmentally preferred status of paper products. However, a subsequent EPA review in 1984 recommended continual financial support for the paper recycling industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been arguments amongst those involved in this industry as to the effectiveness of this measure but, given the outcome of the Industry Commission recommendations in relation to recycling paper, we will not oppose this measure. However, I should say in passing that in this budget Labor's net reduction in support for recycling is some $43.5 million over four years. I wonder how this government intends to support recycling with that sort of withdrawal of funds from its programs over the next four years. I wonder how it will ensure that jobs are created&mdash;not destroyed&mdash;in recycling industries. So we will not be opposing those measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to the main point. The question that I pose to this parliament and to the people of Australia is: what do we mean when we talk about a man being taken at his word in terms of national debate?

He knew that that implied that his promise would not be believed. He could not go to the people of Australia at the National Press Club and imply, `These are not promises. I can understand my promises may not be understood and may not be believed. People might be a little sceptical or cynical about anything that I say.' Instead, he went to the press club and said, `This is l-a-w, law.' Of course we know what happened to l-a-w, law. It became l-i-e, lie.

This 189.8 per cent increase in total tax revenue will occur over a period when inflation rises by only 68.4 per cent. So we have a real increase in tax revenue above inflation of over 120 per cent.

In respect of taxation matters, it started out just a few years ago as economic rationalists with a big book based on a 15 per cent GST. Those opposite are policy fundamentalists because the book was the wrong book and it had in it the wrong policy and the wrong approach to taxation.

There is nothing wrong with a bit of economic rationalism and a bit of spine when it comes to a savings strategy or a rational taxation regime, but it does not have to include a 15 per cent regressive GST. That is where those opposite went wrong&mdash;they had the wrong policy approach. They do not know how to put rational economic and taxation policies in place but this government does. That is strongly reflected in these sales tax measures currently before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures also relate&mdash;and this is why I am supporting the legislation&mdash;to the government's sophisticated savings strategy.

When cyclical variations affect the underlying rate of the current account deficit as they did in 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1995 and when the proportion of GDP approaches six per cent, for sensible reasons, growth has slowed. There are only two answers to that constraint on Australia's long-term economic growth. The first is to make the economy more competitive. The government is doing that through the national competition policy reforms. The Industry Commission has estimated that those reforms will lower the current account deficit by two per cent as a proportion of GDP and that is very significant.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member who raised the point of order was not in the chamber when we heard the nursery rhymes about Alice in Wonderland and Humpty Dumpty. In terms of economic policy for 1995 both sides of the House need to have a savings strategy. It is only possible to have credible economic policies if there is a savings strategy in place to address the current account deficit. This legislation is a very important part of the government's savings strategy that is designed to bring the federal budget into surplus. These sales tax measures will add to public savings. That is important because the current account deficit is a reflection of Australia funding investment by using the savings of other nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only close the gap between national savings and national investment by lifting the savings stock in Australia. We always hear from the opposition that public savings are very important to achieve that. Moving the federal budget from a deficit in 1994-95 to a healthy surplus in 1995-96 is the biggest contribution to public savings that has been seen in the fiscal policy area for a long while. You have to go back to the mid-1980s to see such an important contribution to public savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a genuine nation building task to allow the Australian economy to break free of any growth restraint on the external account. It can only happen by increasing national savings which by definition means lowing the share of consumption. There is one thing that should be tattooed onto the foreheads of those opposite&mdash;this would allow the press gallery to read it every day when those opposite go to their press conferences&mdash;and that is that GDP is equal to national savings plus national consumption. Any party that comes into this place with a savings strategy needs to be aware that improved savings as a proportion of GDP mean a lower share for consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an undeniable and unavoidable economic rule. It demonstrates the point that in terms of a credible savings strategy there is no quick fix and there is no magic pudding. Savings can only be achieved as a proportion of GDP at the expense of consumption. These sales tax measures before the House are a very important improvement in public savings that also acknowledge a decline in private rates of consumption. They add significantly to Australia's economic strategy. Part of the government's savings strategy on the one hand is to move into a structural surplus in the budget after this, having had this budget in technical surplus, and on the other hand to introduce a superannuation savings strategy that the opposition could only dream about when it was last in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first measure of the legislation is to increase the sales tax payable on passenger motor vehicles to the general rate of 21 per cent&mdash;that is, to move it from 16.5 per cent back to 21 per cent where it was prior to One Nation. This acknowledges another economic truth that the opposition should accept&mdash;that is, the One Nation statement was designed for counter-cyclical reasons. It was designed to lift Australia out of a period of low consumption and low aggregate demand and get the economy growing again, which it did so magnificently. Having achieved the counter-cyclical purpose of One Nation, and with the economy now growing so strongly, it is perfectly legitimate for this government to change policy three years after One Nation and bring the passenger motor vehicles back to the general sales tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How has the car industry changed in those three years? Three years ago, at the time of One Nation, the car industry was suffering from a lack of consumption, a lack of aggregate demand, in the Australian economy. But now, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out last week in question time, we have waiting times of six months for some Australian cars. If you decide to purchase an Australian produced car in 1995, there is up to a six-month wait for some models to be delivered. That is how strong the demand and the consumption have become in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very reason why the sales tax was reduced three years ago has disappeared totally because industry changes. Market conditions are constantly evolving, and it is only sensible that a government would react to those changes. You are a dumb lot if you make no response in policy to changed circumstances. The first principle of good government is change with the times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If aggregate demand and consumption are running away too strongly, if they are spilling over into problems on the external account, the nation needs to address its lack of savings. It can do so by re-establishing the sales tax rate for passenger motor vehicles. It is a very sensible and simple proposition which should be embraced by the opposition and not be the subject of scare campaigns, cheap election populism, or cheap point scoring exercises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So too is the application of sales tax to a number of building materials sensible. The revenue gain estimated in 1995-96 is $215 million. At various times, both sides of the House have conceded that an important goal for the national savings strategy is to narrow the distortions in the taxation treatment of alternative forms of saving. It is a very simple proposition. This was reflected most clearly in the FitzGerald report on national savings which was at the time heralded by the then shadow Treasurer, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as a landmark report, something the government should act on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here is the government in the 1995-96 budget trying to narrow the distortion by lifting the effective tax rate on owner-occupied housing, but only by a modest amount. Still it is moving in the right direction. What is so outstanding about the government's saving strategy is that it is moving in the right direction. A willingness to increase national savings, particularly public savings, and just take the top off private consumption at the very peak of the economic cycle is good economic policy. It is outstanding economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real task in Australia in terms of the housing sector is to knock the top off conspicuous housing consumption. Every dollar in this country that goes into conspicuous housing consumption is a dollar that is not going into bank savings, share equities or employee superannuation contributions, where it could be used to finance Australia's aggressive rate of investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience with this goes back to my days in local government when one of the business people in the city of Liverpool made a windfall gain on a property development exercise. I asked that business person, `What will you do with your windfall gain? Will you put it into value added investment, a bit of manufacturing, a bit of share investment? Will you put it into other forms of equity, into bank savings or into a superannuation scheme where it could be accessed for investment purposes?' He said, `No, I am not doing any of that. I am building a bigger house.' The fellow at the time lived in a place about a third of the size of this one. He lived in a big house and he was going to build an even bigger house because he acknowledged that it was free from any form of taxation. That is the problem we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conspicuous housing consumption at that luxury level of the market, when it is dragging on the pool of savings and adding to consumption in such an economically useless fashion, is against the national interest. This government recognises that fact, as did the opposition years ago. At the time of Fightback and John Hewson's leadership of the Liberal Party, he set this as a legitimate goal for public policy&mdash;that is, to narrow the distortions in the effective taxation treatment of alternative forms of savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the national and public interest, this parliament should not be afraid of taxation measures which affect the housing sector, particularly measures as modest as this 12 per cent rate on a narrow band of building materials. To listen to the opposition, you would think that the roof was going to fall in, literally. The truth is that this is for the average home buyer an entirely affordable sales tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to move at that top end of the housing market and knock the top off the conspicuous housing consumption so admired by members opposite. For the national economic interest, it is of very little value. It is in fact a drain on the national savings pool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My conclusion on these measures, and I wish it was reflected in the contributions of opposition members, is that there is no quick fix, no magic pudding, no easy way in which to improve this nation's savings pool because as a proportion of GDP it means improving savings at the expense of the consumption share. The Australian people understand that. Over the 12 years of the internationalisation of the Australian economy, Australians have become more sophisticated in understanding the economic debate. They are looking out for the carpetbaggers, the election populists and the opportunists and they will finger them at the first available opportunity. They will finger them at the next election for who they are and what they represent. In the sophisticated debates that our trading nation should have, they understand that national savings policy is a key test of leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) say, as he did recently on radio 2UE, `Conceptually of course we favour national savings,' the Australian people ask, `Where's the substance? Where's the policy to turn the concept into reality?' It is not in the attitude the opposition is taking to this legislation because it is saying that it will try to knock it back in the Senate. Those opposite will try to knock it back in the Senate but, if it is passed by the Senate, they will not give a commitment to knock it off if they were to win the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people know how shallow that sort of response is. If it is good enough to oppose in the Senate, it should be good enough for the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer to give a public commitment that, in government, the Liberal and National parties would abolish these sales tax measures. They will not give that commitment. Neither the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow finance spokesperson nor the shadow treasury spokesperson will come into the parliament to debate these issues on the second reading. So the Australian people, in our sophisticated economic debate, can finger that as an abdication of leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is again following the old motto employed by Jim Hacker: I am their leader, I must follow them. That is the sort of attitude that the Leader of the Opposition has embraced. When he says, `Conceptually of course we favour national savings,' the Australian people ask him, `Where's the policy to turn the concept into reality?' When people see the members of the opposition moving in the wrong direction, as they are on this legislation, they are exposed totally as oppositionists, populists, carpetbaggers, opportunists and absolute policy flakes. </PARA>

Over Labor's long 12 years in office, it has increased sales tax revenue by a whopping 305.7 per cent.

Business is affected by the compliance costs of meeting all obligations under the law, and sales tax continues to be built into the cost of business inputs. So-called streamlining has, by all accounts, made the operation of the sales tax system by the Australian Taxation Office much smoother but has done nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing&mdash;to improve the lot of complying taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, there are 1,109 taxpayer entities contributing 75.4 per cent of total sales tax revenue, for which the cost of complying with the law is relatively cheap. However, there are 75,000 small to medium sized businesses which have to pay sales tax and which face much higher compliance costs. According to the Australian Tax Research Foundation, entities paying over $1 million sales tax per annum&mdash;that is just over 1,000 companies&mdash;incurred a compliance cost of less than 0.4 per cent of the tax paid or collected and remitted. However, those with annual sales tax liabilities of $50,000 or less, 85 per cent of all entities paying sales tax, incurred a compliance cost of nearly 25 per cent on the tax collected and remitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These findings are supported by Mr Jeff Pope in a research paper published in August 1994. Mr Pope stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated total compliance costs of WST in 1990/91 are $179 million, or 1.9 percent of the WST revenue of $9,365 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Internal costs account for 95 percent and external costs (professional fees) account for 5 percent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compliance costs as a percentage of tax paid are regressive, falling from 24 percent to 0.13 percent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The smallest taxpayers remit an average of four dollars of tax for every dollar spent on compliance costs, compared with WST remittance of $799 per dollar of compliance costs for the largest taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a ridiculous situation&mdash;and it is regressive, as Mr Pope has pointed out. The system simply requires simplification&mdash;not more tinkering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I raise, which negatively impacts on business, is that sales tax continues to be built into the cost of business inputs. This is because in many cases wholesale sales tax is not paid directly but indirectly through the higher prices charged by suppliers who themselves must pay sales tax. The available system of exemptions has done little to reduce the amount of sales tax cascading throughout the production process of too many firms throughout our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a whole range of other indirect taxes, such as fuel excise and payroll tax, which business must pay for either directly or indirectly through the higher costs passed on by their suppliers. These taxes are built into the price of a whole range of goods and services that are purchased in the course of conducting business activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general criticisms of the sales tax system are many. But the government's ad hoc approach will not solve the problems. The reality is that this government merely ignores the problems in the sales tax system. It ignores the distortion of production and consumption decisions that come about because some goods are hit by sales tax while other goods are not. It ignores the further distortions that result from having a multiple indirect tax rate structure which includes very high rates of tax on some goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new measures fail to address the vast array of anomalies that have emerged under the wholesale sales tax, both in the sales tax treatment of certain goods and in the range of exemptions made available to some users of these goods but not to others. There is no recognition of the cascading effect of sales tax, and other indirect taxes for that matter, through the production process. Sales tax will continue to fall heavily on intermediate business inputs, investment goods and exports in addition to the burden placed on consumers. The wholesales sales tax system thus serves to undermine the productive and export potential of Australian businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anomalies in the sales tax system are widespread and, without doubt, beyond resolution by this government. Wedding rings are exempt from sales tax, yet engagement rings are taxed at 31 per cent. Cordial is taxed at 11 per cent, but soft drinks are taxed at 21 per cent. Some household wares are taxed at 11 per cent, but cleaning and other products are taxed at 21 per cent. Biscuits and snack products are taxed&mdash;they are also relatively more often consumed by lower income people&mdash;yet caviar, crayfish, expensive meats and exotic fruits, which are more likely to be purchased by higher income groups, are not taxed. On a slightly different tack, why should a sign painted on a wall not be subject to sales tax while a sign painted on a board and then attached to the wall is? Why do these anomalies remain in the sales tax system? David Vos of Coopers and Lybrand has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is understood the Labor Party and the Democrats believe in the selective taxing of different goods based on their relative nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the greater number of classifications, the greater the complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales tax is presently complex because governments over the years have moved the rate of sales tax on particular goods up or down to appease some whim or to settle some perceived anomaly or inconsistency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Solve one anomaly, and the government creates another.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the best way of fixing the problem? The simplest way to solve the tax problem would be to abolish sales tax and introduce a consumption tax along the lines of a value added tax or a goods and services tax. This method would even fix the issue of tax payable on the sign that I mentioned earlier. However, the people of Australia rejected that at the last poll. It is off the agenda, and it will not return. The only other viable solution, therefore, is to scrap the existing sales tax system and rebuild it from scratch with simplicity being the No. 1 priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to have only one sales tax rate apply across the board so that sales tax applies as widely as possible and exemptions are kept to a minimum. The only  exemptions that should be built into the sales tax system are those for business inputs and exports. To have sales tax and excises built into the price of exports is simply a disgrace. It handicaps Australian exporters trying to operate in an extremely competitive international market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, sales tax needs a major overhaul. The government's so-called streamlining is inadequate. Labor must make the necessary changes to the sales tax system to reduce the cost of compliance and get off the backs of Australian businesses&mdash;in particular, our exporters. Unfortunately, Labor has no policy direction with the present Prime Minister at the helm. Only the election of a coalition government will bring about the necessary reforms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sales tax legislation now before the House gives effect to certain revenue raising measures announced in the 1995 budget. In that budget, the government announced a combination of cost-cutting measures and revenue raising measures that have brought the federal budget into surplus well ahead of schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary aim of this strategy has been to reduce, as much as the government can, those market pressures on interest rates. Recent interest rate trends in the marketplace indicate that the government's strategy has been largely successful. Reports in today's national media indicate that short-term rates have fallen below the Reserve Bank official rate of 7.5 per cent and that long-term rates were slashed by 0.4 of a percentage point in response to the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the coalition are concerned, this good news is the stuff nightmares are made of. The opposition's position has always been to blame the government when there are interest rate rises and congratulate everybody else when interest rates fall. These falls are good news for Australian households and businesses throughout the Geelong region, and especially for those home buyers who are now reaping the benefits of a price cutting war on fixed home loan rates in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the primary aim of the budget was to reduce, as best the government could, the pressures on interest rates and we have been spectacularly successful in that respect. The sales tax legislation before the House relates primarily to the following goods: recycled paper, building materials, model aircraft, passenger motor vehicles, scaffolding, racking and shelving and floor safes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the proposed increase in the sales tax on motor vehicles that I would like to comment a bit more on in this debate. While I understand and appreciate the overall strategy of the government of bringing the budget into surplus this year and reducing that pressure on interest rates, the sales tax increase has meant that several of my constituents who had placed their orders for vehicles as far back as December 1994 and January and February 1995 must now deal with a set of economic and commercial circumstances they did not anticipate when they placed their orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given those constituents an undertaking that I would raise this matter in debate in the House and I am doing so here tonight. In a sense, they have been caught in a commercial crossfire. It is their particular circumstance which prompted me to request the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to examine any possibility at all of exempting these constituents who had longstanding orders for motor vehicles from the sales tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will expand on their circumstance. As I mentioned earlier, many placed orders especially with Ford dealers to purchase Ford cars as far back as December 1994 and February 1995. Some of those people were Ford employees who, because they receive some concessions on purchases of company vehicles, are continually rescheduled to the bottom of the dealer's customer list when the general demand is strong and vehicles are in short supply. What we have seen in the marketplace in recent times is a strong demand for Ford cars and a difficulty on the part of the company in supplying that demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reliably informed that Ford was unable to achieve more than 10 production days in April 1995 due to industrial action that occurred outside of the company, with the BTR Nylex dispute, and some internal industrial disputation Ford itself faced. These factors, coupled with the public holidays that occurred in April, simply meant that the company did not get any more than 10 production days, which set its production schedules back enormously and has led to this pent-up demand in the marketplace. These factors exacerbated Ford's supply problem and, coupled with the strong demand for its vehicles, has brought about a vehicle delivery situation which has stretched to months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that Ford customers would have been allowed to renegotiate their purchase contracts with the dealers, given these extraordinary circumstances which have occurred beyond their control. But, unfortunately, that is not the case. The fine print in the dealers' contracts makes the customer liable for increases brought about by factors such as the ones we are debating in this House tonight. The unfortunate thing about it is that many of those customers were not made aware by the dealers of the fine print in those contracts and are now liable for any increases. Dealers, of course, have refused to absorb even part of any increase that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my constituents have been caught in that commercial crossfire. We have seen strong demand for the Ford product and difficulty in supply and delivery by that company which has been quite beyond the customers' control. They have had to deal with the fine print in the dealers' contracts, which does not enable them to get any redress from the dealers, and they have had to contend with the increases in the sales tax that have been brought down in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have stated, I wrote to the Treasurer outlining the particular circumstances many of my constituents found themselves in, and I did request him to explore the issue of bona fide exemptions. The Treasurer has advised me that such exemptions are not possible because of the precedents that they set, and that the government has followed on this occasion the practice of previous Liberal governments and previous Labor governments in scheduling any sales tax increases from budget night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand, also, that such exemptions would be extremely complex to administer, given the point at which the tax is levied and given the arrangements that dealers make with their wholesalers, or their wholesaling arm, to delay to the last possible moment the point at which the consumer actually pays the money over to the retailer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer holds the view that the financial integrity of the budget has to be maintained on this occasion. I guess that, if we examine the positive market reaction to the budget where we have seen an actual lowering of interest rates already in some sectors of the financial markets, that situation certainly bears out the veracity of the Treasurer's views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with a great deal of patience to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and his diatribe against the government. But the simple fact of the matter is that the coalition, when it left office at the federal level, was a big taxing, big spending government. The members of the coalition do not like to hear people on this side of the House levy that charge. But it is, of course, an accurate charge borne out by the national accounts statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the honourable member for Curtin might seek to levy criticism on the government, he does not levy the same criticism at the highest taxing Liberal state government in the Commonwealth&mdash;in my state of Victoria. It is that particular government which is imposing quite enormous burdens on Victorian taxpayers by virtue of the policies that it is pursuing. The opposition hypocrisy on this matter just does not extend to the taxation area. It really extends to its whole view of the car industry and its synthetic concerns for car customers and car workers in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cast our minds back down the time tunnel to 1983 and we look at the profile of the car industry in Australia at that time, we can see that we had an archaic industrial structure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For customers in that scenario, we had the car industry producing high priced cars, which meant that ordinary working people paid far more for their cars than they should have. The industry was typified by low levels of investment in new technology. We had an industrial relations system in operation and a culture in the car industry that was nothing short of disgraceful with high levels of industrial disputation and conflict in the enterprises within that sector. The export capability of the sector was simply uncompetitive and not into the export marketplace at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1983, when the coalition went out of government, to 1993, the coalition's view of the car industry changed from one of a do nothing policy to one of having a crack at car workers and decimating the industry. We do not have to go back too far to remember the famous Captain Zero and his plan to wipe out the Australian car industry in this country. That particular policy was opposed by the industry itself. It was opposed by unions in the industry. It was opposed by local governments. It was opposed by local communities, which would have been seriously affected by the coalition's policy if it had been on the treasury bench now and had been implementing the zero tariff policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's plan for the Australian car industry is a sensible, practical one that is designed to restructure the industry to meet the competitive challenges of the future. We have ushered in a new era of industrial peace to this industry. We have changed the work practices to improve productivity. We have given the industry a competitive focus and reoriented the workplace culture to achieving greater productivity. We have overseen massive investments by the major car manufacturers in the industry and it is now exporting to the rest of the world. We have strong exports of components as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is in the area of industrial relations that the hypocrisy of the opposition is most clearly exposed. Recently Ford workers struck an enterprise bargain with the Ford Motor Co. The essence of the benefits that will flow to Geelong car workers from this enterprise deal are: negotiated wage rises of between $2,500 and $4,000 per year; 13 weeks long service leave after 10 years; paid maternity leave; the introduction of family leave; increases in sick leave; the introduction of a relief operators allowance; and improved superannuation provisions. But these award improvements would be slashed by John Howard with a Kennett style individual contract system for the Ford workers at the Geelong Ford plant. </PARA>

We would have an industrial relations system that would see Ford workers yet again in conflict with their employers on the factory floor. We would see an industrial relations system that would rip the heart out of their hard-fought wages and conditions. We would see an industrial relations system that would return this industry to the condition that it was in when we took over in 1983: a decrepit piece of archaeology that belongs somewhere in an industrial structure of the 1950s and the 1960s, not one appropriate to the competitive challenges and needs of the 1990s and beyond the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms were opposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who was incapable of dropping his hard line on industrial relations. While generally the opposition is a policy free zone, it has not dumped the thrust of Jobsback, its 1993 wage and industrial relations policy. In 14 years the opposition leader has supported only two wage increases&mdash;two $8 safety net increases in 14 years; only $1.10 per week for every year of 14 years.

And if Australian workers need reminding of what that means, they should just look at the Victorian government's recent actions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the industrial relations strategies of the opposition could not be clearer to Australian workers: because it has only committed itself to minimum protection for workers, entitlements such as penalty rates, leave loading, shift allowance and family leave would be abolished under the coalition.

For a typical unskilled labourer who currently works an average amount of overtime&mdash;which is 10 hours&mdash;without penalties, the reduction in overtime pay would be $199 per week or $4,888 per year. For a part-time worker on low pay&mdash;say, a nurse who works 16 hours each weekend&mdash;under the current arrangements his or her pay would be $299 a week but without penalties it is reduced to $184 a week. This amounts to a loss of $5,970 a year or, put another way, a 38 per cent wage reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be only one conclusion: the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip money and conditions away from people earning average wages. The Leader of the Opposition would like nothing better than to take away from these people their annual leave loadings and their overtime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will say that under its system you can opt to stay under the award but there will be no updating of the award over time and all new entrants to the work force will be assured of only four basic minimum conditions. The objective is to reduce real wages for ordinary workers. The net result of the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is an erosion of the working conditions and the safety net for all Australian workers. This has been demonstrated by the Kennett and other conservative state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1993 the size of the federal industrial relations system has increased by 400,000 workers. This has been due entirely to the neanderthal industrial policies of the conservative state governments, such as the one in Victoria. Since 1993, federally, we have seen the introduction, through the Industrial Relations Reform Act, of national minimum entitlements based on ILO conventions. These have all been opposed by the opposition. These entitlements guarantee all workers the right to a fair minimum wage, 12 months unpaid parental leave, equal pay for work of equal value and protection against unfair dismissal. All of these ILO mandated standards are in the firing line under Jobsback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the next federal election the danger of these attacks is greater. This time the stakes are higher. For all workers in Queensland who have escaped hardline conservative state government industrial relations policies, the Leader of the Opposition, federally, presents a new and greater threat, a threat from which there will be no escape. To all Australian workers who rely on the national minimum standards, including protection from unfair dismissal, the Leader of the Opposition will be the enemy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is astonishing is his belief that he can marry this kind of industrial relations policy with his pro-family rhetoric. He professes to be concerned about the battlers and yet he wants to carve away from a nurse $6,000 a year and from an unskilled person just on $5,000 a year. That is what the Leader of the Opposition is on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can he be pro-family when he wants to rip away the safety net of family income earners? How can he be pro-family when he will guarantee new workers the protection of only one or two minimum entitlements? How can it be pro-family to put at risk penalty rates, shift allowances, public holidays, loadings and restrictions on working hours?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the adjournment I want to point out to the House the extraordinary performance we saw from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) in the Main Committee. In one of the most irresponsible and misleading contributions I have ever heard, in just five minutes he made at least four grossly misleading statements. The first was in relation to road funding, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the federal government hands to states and to local government an amount in excess of $2 billion of untied funds which is spent on roads.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words he used. But, if you look at page 3-202 of Budget Paper No. 1 at the identified road grants to the states, you will find that they were $369.2 million and that identified local road grants on page 3-205 were $358.1 million. That is a total of $727 million, not the $2 billion that the parliamentary secretary bandied around. As someone who supposedly knows what goes on in the portfolio, I would have thought he would have a few ideas. Seven hundred million dollars is very different from $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then talked about the amount of money that states spend on the roads as if it all came from the Commonwealth. What about all the money the motorists pay to the states in taxes? There are fuel franchise fees, registration charges, licensing fees, tolls in some cases, fines and stamp duty. All of this money is raised by the state government; it does not come from the Commonwealth. It seems he could not understand the difference and got quite confused as he continued his speech. It is a great worry to think that the parliamentary secretary for transport really does not understand this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get to the second misleading statement in his speech. He said that the Bureau of Transport Economics says that at least $6 billion a year is associated with the cost of road safety. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What pays for that? Who pays for the ambulances, the hospitals and all of that? It comes out of untied funds that the federal government hands over.</PARA>
<PARA>What a load of nonsense. He obviously has not heard about compulsory third party, comprehensive insurance, private health insurance, the Medicare levy and all these things that are paid for by the motorists and none of which have got anything to do with the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To find a bit of authority he did not have to go any further than the BCA report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Refocusing road reform</EMPHASIS>. Page 310 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Interstate Commission (ISC 1990) estimated that the `uncompensated' cost derived from subtracting . . . insurance premiums . . . from an estimated total road accident cost . . . was $1.6 billion . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was just one report. Next, Dr Quiggin, someone the Labor Party likes to quote, in 1993 estimated that a `lower bound' solution of accident costs imposed by motorists on non-motorists was $1.2 billion per year&mdash;even less. Meyrick Associates in a 1994 report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total external cost of accidents to be taken into account in charging policies is therefore $1350 million . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very big difference from the $6 billion that the parliamentary secretary seemed to quote. I wonder whether he was getting himself confused. If he looked in the budget papers, he would have found that the total Commonwealth contribution to road safety was $6.4 million, not billion. Obviously this poor man is rather confused. Then he said about petrol pricing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petrol tax argument is a dud . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even the Road Transport Forum has given it away. Even the automobile associations have given it away.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where this guy is, because he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Show me when they last ran the petrol tax argument.</PARA>
<PARA>He ought to have a clear look. In the latest annual report of the Australian Automobile Association, the third paragraph of the president's report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing the level of taxes on road users and reducing the level of expenditure on roads inevitably leads to higher transport costs, higher prices, higher inflation and less competitive exports.</PARA>
<PARA>Below it there is a chart showing fuel excise versus expenditure on roads. If he looked at the RTF contribution to the budget papers, he would find that in 1995 it brought the same argument up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this man is rather confused. In the five minutes he made at least four major misleading statements&mdash;I cannot get to the fourth one in the time available to me. Clearly, he ought to hang his head in shame. If he pretends to be a minister, then he has obviously got to do a lot better. It was a foolish contribution and I think the smirk on his face showed that even he did not take his contribution seriously. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to make some remarks concerning the budget and its implications for North Queensland. North Queensland is the great juggernaut of the Australian economy, producing some $12,000 million a year in export earnings. Whilst I have not had time to pin all the figures down exactly, Mount Isa Mines produces some $1,200 million to $1,300 million a year in export earnings; the coal industry, about $4,000 million; the tourism industry, about $2,000 million; the aluminium industry, about $1,000 million; the sugar industry, about $2,000 million; and the cattle and sheep industries, about $2,000 million. These add up to some $12,000 million per year in export earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When the Australian dollar was allowed to float in 1986, the dollar floated down to 59c. At that time Australia owed only some $70,000-odd million. Today Australia owes&mdash;as we know from the figures that were released recently&mdash;$170,000 million. Since the dollar floated down to 59c in 1986, presumably today it would float down to less than 59c if it were allowed to free float, if there were not intervention buying by the Reserve Bank and if there were not artificial interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition of Mr Hitler and Mr Goebbels, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mein Kampf</EMPHASIS>, was that if you say something even though it is not true and say it long enough and often enough people will believe it. People on the other side have obviously very satisfactorily read and digested that. They have actually got people believing that interest rates of 10 per cent for business are really excellent. Those interest rates of 10 per cent for business exist at a time when our trading partners in the United States have interest rates of 6 1/2 per cent and our trading partners in Japan have interest rates of 3 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the dollar floated down to where it should be&mdash;if it went to 59c then I think we could assume it would go to 50c now&mdash;that would mean an extra 50 per cent, nearly $6,000 million, coming into the economy of North Queensland, defined as Bundaberg north. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the interjection from the honourable member for Leichhardt. He is denigrating and laughing at me for advocating the dollar being pushed down. That would bring into Cairns, his electorate, about $300 million a year extra in export earnings; and he is sitting there laughing. But then people in Cairns say that he laughs at most things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on. The way to accomplish that is to bring interest rates down to the same levels as our trading partners in the United States and Japan. The rate in Japan the last time I looked was 3.5 per cent, and six per cent in the United States. This would mean interest rates in this country of about four or five per cent. That would bring the dollar down to where it should be. The theft literally of thousands of millions of dollars which the people of North Queensland are entitled to would then be returned to those people, who at the present moment are reeling on the ropes. Not only have they got the theft of the Australian dollar being placed up where it is but also they have the thieving out of their pockets through interest rates&mdash;and I am not even including the tax of the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Couple that with the aggressive marketing policies in the areas of petrol and wool. The minimum price scheme which enabled us to get a decent price for our product was abolished by the socialists who are in government in Australia at the present moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to refer to the outrageous misuse of the forms of this parliament by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) yesterday. In particular, I wish to refer to the speech that he made to the Main Committee on the appropriation bill in which he outrageously attacked in an unsubstantiated fashion a number of people, including Mr Michael Costello and Mr Mark Leibler. The honourable member for Deakin has a long history of making paranoid conspiracy theories and accusations in this place and elsewhere without any substantiation. I will just give some examples. In 1983 he suggested that the then Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, was connected with the mafia. Subsequently he said that Kokums, the Swedish shipping firm, was run by Soviet spies. Then he said that the former judge of the High Court, Lionel Murphy, had been engaged in meetings with Abe Saffron.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1980s the honourable member said that the former member for Hotham, Mr Lewis Kent, was a spy for a foreign government. More recently he has made other attacks on Mr Mark Leibler which were described by members of his own party, such as the former member for MacKellar, as `disgraceful' and even by the current honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as `a matter of regret'. Most recently he has attacked the Smorgon family as being linked with organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one common thread in all of these accusations&mdash;that is, that there has been no substantiation and no follow-up. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has been convicted of any crimes or even charged with respect to any of the allegations made.

We are not told where he got this letter purporting to relate to a transfer of $640,000 of drug money to Mr Michael Costello. There is no evidence of authenticity of the letter. In effect, there is just a complete outrageous unsubstantiated smear of a senior public servant who obviously cannot reply in this forum. By implication, he accuses Mr Costello of rendering services to a foreign government or intelligence service for drug money. Some of his evidence to indicate the authenticity of this accusation includes the following: that Mr Costello was the architect of the Cambodian peace plan and he actually did not have much of a background in Asia. What that has to do with the accusation is beyond me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Deakin also refers to allegations of `many long lunches, dinners and animated conversations' with a Soviet employee, Valery Zemskov, who is alleged to be a KGB agent. What the fact that Mr Costello has alleged to have had animated conversations or dinners with anybody has to do&mdash;even if those accusations are true, and I would be interested to know what the source of those is&mdash;with an allegation that he has received substantial amounts of drug money from a foreign government is also absolutely beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member has also stated that Mr Costello `has been suspected and interviewed on previous occasions by the AFP in relation to the disclosure of official information'. How do we know that he is suspected? What is the basis of this accusation? Surely it is logical that if a leak was being investigated the Federal Police would actually talk to the head of the department about it. If you actually look at some of the specifics, he describes Mr Costello as a monument to mafia mateship. Again, a smear has been thrown around with gay abandon and with no supporting evidence. He indicates that at the time this alleged letter was written, Mr Costello was overseas. So what? He also points out that Mr Costello has been to Brazil and Chile, which happened to be in the same continent as the country that this letter is alleged to have come from. What an incredible, ridiculous load of nonsense!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It really is quite absurd to expect us to consider in any detail these important portfolio areas in five minutes. I intend to talk for a short time about my favourite topic, that is, tourism. I cannot do justice to that in five minutes, but I would like to make a few remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, tourism remains very important to the Australian economy. I am sure many members will have read the recent report by the Tourism Forecasting Council. It is an excellent document and paints a glowing picture of Australia's tourism industry, not only of the consistent growth that has occurred over the last 15 years but also, more importantly, of the very healthy looking forecasts for the industry between now and the year 2000. It says that in the year 2000 6.3 million people are expected to visit Australia, that is more than double the number that visited in 1993, and for the next 10 years inbound tourism is expected to grow by 10 per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is well known for its contribution to export earnings of around $10.6 billion per annum. It is a very important industry to Australia. I suspect that the government has done very little to assist the tourism industry. The tourism industry is one of those Australian industries which has grown despite the government. It is a great tribute to the many small business people in every part of the tourism industry who have made the industry what it is. Many of those people are my constituents, so I see at first hand exactly what they are doing on a day-to-day basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of reasons why we should not be complacent about our tourism industry. When the vice-president of All Nippon Airways visited Australia last week, he made some very pertinent remarks. He informed us&mdash;it was news to a lot of people&mdash;that Japanese tourists find visiting Australia expensive compared with going to the west coast of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might think, with the way the $A has depreciated against the yen in recent times, that we would find it very expensive to go to Japan, but the point is that we are almost paying the Japanese to come here. If Australia is an expensive destination for the Japanese, of all people, then it probably ought to ring warning bells for the government to ask why. I hope that the comments made by that visiting Japanese airline executive will be taken very seriously and that we might look at that. I suspect the fact that we have an archaic industrial relations system is probably a major factor in contributing to that lack of competitiveness. We need to be very careful. As was pointed out, the industry is volatile for all sorts of reasons and we should not be complacent about the fact that the Japanese will continue to support Australia to the extent that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that the vice-president of All Nippon Airways also talked about the need for Australia to revise its visa system. That is something the government ought to consider. I know it comes up from time to time and perhaps, with VJ day approaching, it may not be entirely appropriate to put it firmly on the agenda at this particular time. Our visa system is, once again, becoming out of date and out of step with a lot of other countries. Few Asians are overstayers and the Japanese do not overstay in any great number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence that when other countries have revised their visa system it has led to an increase in tourism. So Australia ought to make it as attractive as possible for Asians to come here. Certainly, we ought to continue to encourage Japanese visitors to come here. Revising the visa restrictions which currently apply would be one way of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration recently brought down its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS>. There are lots of recommendations in the report which I hope the government will look at. None of the recommendations surfaced in the budget, but I am prepared to concede that that was because the report came down shortly before the budget. Our visiting Japanese airline executive called for incentives to be put in place. As a result of that call, it becomes clear that incentives are needed. EMDG is one, but there are numerous others recommended here. Rather than incentives for the tourism industry, what we have in the budget are a number of disincentives, that is, an increase in company tax, increases in tax on building materials, an increase in sales tax on motor cars and all sorts of things which are going to make it more expensive for tourism operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a shortage of accommodation, not only on the Gold Coast but in Cairns. We need to do everything we can to fix that problem as quickly as possible, but what the government has done in this budget is actually to make the problem worse. I believe that is something that needs to be looked at urgently. The other imposts on small business that came in the budget do impact directly on our tourism industry, and I can assure the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that those&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) focused on tourism. It is worth noting that, when compared with 1983, tourism in 1995 is a massive contributor to the Australian national economy. Whereas it was not even an industry that was fully recognised by the federal government in 1983, when the Liberals were last in power, today tourism represents an $11.2 billion earner to Australia in terms of foreign exchange.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a massive increase in the number of tourists who come here, and the growth is continuing. They are coming not only from Japan but from the whole north Asia region. From Korea, from Taiwan and even from China, the number of visitors coming here has been growing at seven, eight and 10 per cent over the last couple of years; and that is because we have had a concerted strategy of marketing into Japan and into north Asia as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the appropriations that are allocated in this year's budget, the Australian Tourism Commission will be able to continue with that job. It is developing the increasing sophistication demanded by the market. People packaging holidays in Japan tell us that these days the Japanese tourist is looking for more than the tightly targeted package that would have been sold and was accepted in their tours in the past. Now, tourists from Japan are looking for a broader range of experiences. They are wanting to get outside the Cairns area. They are wanting to get to the outback areas. There are a lot more rural holidays taken by Asian tourists, as well as by other tourists coming to Australia. The whole strategy that the Tourism Commission has been adopting has been focused on trying to broaden out the tourism product that visitors coming to Australia can enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago we had the launch of the regional tourism program. Again, that was an initiative of the government which we made a commitment about before the last election and which is being implemented. It is ensuring a building of tourism infrastructure all across Australia. It does not matter whether we go to Queensland or to places like Strahan, on the west coast of Tasmania: the Commonwealth government is there, helping to build the infrastructure that is needed to provide the tourism potential of that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note we have a number of members here from Queensland. The fact of the matter is that the programs we launched in the regional tourism strategy and in the ecotourism strategy were all about trying to broaden the capacity of the infrastructure that exists throughout the whole of the state of Queensland&mdash;much of it in the regional and provincial parts of Queensland&mdash;to make the tourism product in those areas more accessible. We know from the research that the Tourism Commission has done in Japan that that is striking a very positive chord with the Japanese tourists that want to come to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention was made of industrial relations, and the impediment that that might or might not be to the tourism industry. I note that before the budget the big cry of the opposition was that there was going to be a bed tax. That was the big scare that was being run prior to the budget. Of course, that did not eventuate. That was another thing the opposition had on the wish list of things it hoped might be in the budget, but it was not. By its continuing commitment to the Tourism Commission and to the Department of Tourism in the budget allocations, the government has showed that it is maintaining very strongly the Tourism Commission's drive in its international marketing strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to industrial relations, the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who has a very close interest in tourism because of the nature of the tourism product that exists in the Townsville area, reminded me of what the Liberals were actually proposing before the last election with their $3 per hour youth wage. That would have gone very much to the living standards of young people working in the tourism industry in Queensland. We rejected that, and the people of Australia rejected that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed to ensuring that the growth of our tourism industry, which has been growing at seven and eight per cent each year for several years, is maintained. We are committed to ensuring that we take advantage of the big opportunities that are going to come on line over the next few years in marketing Australia's profile around the world, with things like the Olympics and other major events, and that we get full value in the region. The Indonesian tourism minister was here a few weeks ago, and others have come. We know from the range of international visitors who have come here how much potential they see in terms of development of the bilateral relationships in tourism. These appropriations make absolutely crystal clear that we are going to ensure that the Commonwealth plays its rightful role in achieving the full aspirations that we all have for the tourism industry in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not had the opportunity of speaking here before, but I think it is deplorable that the government has cut off the discussion on the budget, that the debate has been transferred over here on limited time, and that we now have to discuss the estimates of Department of Industry, Science and Technology, and other departments, on a five-minute basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to assess the values of any department, it is necessary to look around and to meet some of the people, and to look through the accounts presented in the budget. To have only five minutes for this side of the House to discuss these estimates is a deplorable state of affairs. But the government is in a rush to judgment. It wishes to hurry to the election and to get rid of the budget&mdash;it does not matter what is in it. The hallmark of this government is that the people of Australia must not be told too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget itself, as addressed to industry and commerce, is about business, but as far as business is concerned there is nothing in it but a let-down. Business sought a reduction  in the deficit. This can be done in two ways: by cutting spending or increasing taxes. To cut spending was what businesses were calling for. The government took the soft option: it is an election year, therefore up with taxation. Consequently, investment will fall, growth will fall, and a  fall in employment will follow. On top of that, there will be a negative impact on savings. The cumulative effect is that our international competitive position will not be enhanced by the actions of this government. Indeed, the speech by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) stated that it is a tough environment in which industry is operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the commitment of the government to industry in this budget was to say that, come the year 2000, the last tranches of assistance will be completed. I walk around Canberra and I keep my ears open: I hear the bleats coming from the Treasury that we will have no more industry inquiries. We are heading towards the Bogor agreement and therefore all those areas of assistance will be gone. I can assure the government that the opposition does not see it that way. We are concerned about the outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next meeting of APEC in Osaka is rumoured to be setting down the road towards definite guidelines and positions, to which we can expect the members of APEC to agree. There has been no discussion with the major industry groups about the outcomes of Osaka. I have that from the best authority. Is that any way to carry on discussions and development? Does the government genuinely expect Australia in the year 2010 to be in a position where it can compete on the world stage against the might of Asia without any concern for the outcomes? I listen to the hot air that comes from the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). I quote this little effort, in reference to taking a delegation to the Far East:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So I have faith that Australia is well prepared for a world where technical change in transport and telecommunications is removing the barriers to diverse cultural interactions. Globally, cultural diversity is an increasingly important element in the internationalisation of industry. As structural and technical barriers are removed, cultural diversity assumes a pivotal role in global progress.</PARA>
<PARA>What on earth does that mean? Do you think that the people who are employed in Australian industry know what all that gobbledegook is about? Is that the sort of representation to expect? The hot air goes on; hot air is everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few remaining moments I have, I want to make some comments in relation to the performance of a couple of the programs administered by the department. The Burgess committee was set up to review the programs of assistance. However, the riding instructions given to Mr Burgess were not to look at alternative programs, but to look at the programs we have and see how we might be able to improve them. As a consequence, very little, in my view, came out of the Burgess committee report at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what we do have is an example of a meeting in a regional area. There were 80-odd invitations sent out, four or five people turned up and there was a bevy of about 20 others, including secretaries of departments and local Labor politicians. Is that the way you spend money? Does that get productivity up? Does that get business going? It certainly does not. It is all the gloss. But the final gloss is this: the million-dollar man. There is $10 million in the budget to promote new industry. And who is doing it? None other than John Dawkins. I hope he enjoys it while he has got it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great privilege to speak in this debate. The industry, science and technology portfolio contains agencies and programs which are fundamentally important to the future success and growth of the Australian economy. Indeed, the portfolio contains personnel in whom I have the utmost pride for their capacity and the way they are able to originate and develop policies for the improvement of the Australian economy and put forward programs which are practical and success stories by themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the programs and policies of this portfolio developed in a way which has delivered manufacturing growth in this country at unprecedented levels. For example, Australia's manufacturing sector has recorded growth over the last two to three years in a way which has been unmatched in our history. It has been responsible for nearly a quarter of the total growth of the Australian economy since early 1991, even though it only accounts for 16 per cent of the total economy. Production in the manufacturing sector rose by 9.3 per cent in real terms in 1993-94, compared to overall economic growth of 4.2 per cent. It is an outstanding achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in exports of our elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;ETMs&mdash;has been particularly impressive over the last decade. Australia exported $2.4 billion of ETMs in 1984. In 1994, this figure was $11.5 billion. That is a growth of 16 per cent a year over the decade. Again, a truly outstanding milestone achievement. So the growth in manufacturing and export service industries demonstrates the success of these policies. That success contrasts sharply with the failure of the opposition's industry policies when it was in government. This is a very important point to make in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriations for the industry, science and technology portfolio are $2.8 billion, approximately the same as in 1994-95. In my speech on the appropriation bills, I covered a number of agencies and programs being administered by the portfolio this year and I will not add to those remarks today. But the government has set out in the budget a new phase of our support for one particular program which I want to make a few remarks on, and that is the textile, clothing and footwear industries program. This new TCF development package will continue the process of restructuring, it will help raise productivity to meet the industry's goal of $2 billion of exports by the year 2000. And, importantly, the package will assist the industries to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities that will emerge from Australia's integration within APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department also administers the investment promotion and facilitation program. This is designed to inform overseas investors of Australia's strengths as an investment location. The budget funding of $9 million will continue the program for another year while an evaluation is carried out. I am very proud of this particular program. It also includes activities such as the regional headquarters campaign and the funding of feasibility studies for eligible major investment projects. The work on the investment promotion has encouraged a number of companies to establish regional headquarters in Australia. Among them are British Telecom, CAE Electronics and Methode Electronics, to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in the budget $3.75 million has been allocated over three years to continue the reform process in the construction industry. That will enable the establishment of an Australian construction industry council which will then be able to implement the second stage of the micro-economic reform agenda, with the council drawing its members from leading industry firms. The government will also undertake an independent safety assessment of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor at a cost of $2 million, and that assessment will be carried out by independent researchers in accordance with International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines. This is an important initiative in the methodology we adopt in developing the overall future of the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian participation in international relationships is an important element of the science and technology program. This year, activities will include the implementation of new arrangements for science and technology cooperation with Indonesia, and the signing of a new science and technology agreement with Korea, to name a couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The innovation statement will be brought down by the minister later this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to say how pathetic it is that we have only five minutes for each of the coalition speakers, and only one has a chance to make comment on each of these major departmental estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the welfare aspects of primary industry in the time that is available, and I notice that in the budget statement welfare for the rural sector is now DPIE included in its expenditure. I think in particular of the DRP, the drought relief payment, and I think also of some of the other elements that are now included in primary industry to bolster the figures which should not be there and traditionally have not been there, for example, the diesel rebate, which really is income forgone rather than a payment, and also even labour market programs, which should be under another department and not in primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does indicate the double standard of this government with regard to rural welfare versus urban welfare. At a time when welfare generally is increasing in urban Australia&mdash;and I can understand that because of the high level of unemployment&mdash;it has actually been reduced in rural Australia. I think in particular of the restrictions on household support, which is now only available in declared exceptional circumstance areas, and you know how difficult that has been in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, with the drought. I think also of the inappropriate use of assets tests, which has meant that most rural people basically miss out on any of the welfare provisions available to other Australians. I think of the assets test in relation to Austudy and what that means for denial of educational opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one talks about two Australias, rich and poor, that is certainly the case, but I believe most of the commentators have missed out on who are the rich and who are the poor. The biggest income divide in this country is not in the city; it is between country and city. The best evidence of that is the Parliamentary Research Service comparison of the 1990-91 census of 147 federal electorates with 57 different comparisons&mdash;you can call it the Heinz study, if you like. The number of rural or regional classified electorates would be, at the most, say, one-third of the total of 147, but the comparison indicates that the 12 poorest, those electorates with family incomes below $16,000, are all in rural Australia. Murray is number 30 and there are only eight of the first 30 that are urban electorates. So we can see the tremendous disproportion in income between country and city. Since the census in 1990-91, that would have got worse because of the drought and because of low wool prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make an appeal to the churches&mdash;particularly my own church, the Uniting Church, and the social welfare commission section of the Catholic Church&mdash;to really look at where poverty is in this country. Forget about GSTs, privatisation and things they have attacked the coalition on, and look at exactly where the lowest income in this country is and where the direction for drawing government's attention to the greatest needs in this country should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Uniting Church in Victoria, because its share appeal, which is now under way, is basically for those who have been drought affected. In spite of rain, the cash drought will continue for up to six months, particularly as the government&mdash;showing its usual double standard of country versus city&mdash;included hardly any of Victoria in the exceptional circumstances drought provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if more of Victoria had been included, it would have been of no great value. Because of its negative ideological nature&mdash;against country people&mdash;the government had to change the `exceptional circumstances' several times before anybody ever qualified. One might look at the real assistance provided by the coalition government when it was last in power, compared with what the government has provided and even to what the government claims it is going to provide in the next two or three years. As we know, from the way the government keeps changing and breaking its promises, that is a very doubtful proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recognition of country problems, as well as city problems, has been forgotten by this government. I would like to go on and detail, to a far greater degree, what that is. I would also like to deal to a greater degree with where I believe the churches, being mainly urban based, have also missed the correct focus in this debate. But I have not time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity to make clear the government's strong commitment to rural Australia, as outlined in this budget, and to take issue with some of the matters raised by the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) in respect of that strong commitment, which is demonstrable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget makes it clear that the government is determined to provide the ongoing assistance that large parts of rural Australia need because of the severity of the drought and the ongoing nature of that drought. I would like to go to a couple of the details. The drought assistance measures introduced to date total $302 million, from 1994 up to the period 1997-98. Given the adjustments made to the rural adjustment scheme to ensure that the exceptional circumstances provisions were demand driven, the cost of the package is estimated to increase to $519 million. To have any suggestion that it is not, indeed, a very substantial financial commitment, as well as a very strong recognition of the severity of the particular needs of rural Australia, is to sell this budget and the government's actions well and truly short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought relief payment has already benefited some 10,000 farm families. I do not think anyone would dispute either the need or the severity of the problem. But I would also be arguing, very strongly, that that highlights the substantial nature of the response. The total assistance that those 10,000 farm families have received to date is just on $48 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made clear, even with its decisions in the last fortnight, that it is continuing to monitor those problems, take them seriously, and address them vigorously at the same time. There are measures contained in other areas of the primary industries and energy budget, relating to land care and to the particular needs of parts of Australia faced with soil erosion and so on. There are ongoing commitments to those matters through the comprehensive land care strategy that the government has already announced and is implementing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the whole area of rural financial counselling services. I know, from when we held the inquiries of the banking committee looking at the needs of rural Australia a couple of years ago, that there was increasingly a demand and a requirement both to have the financial institutions more attuned with the needs of rural Australia, and to have independent counselling services that farmers and those involved in agribusiness concerns could go to to get comprehensive, independent advice. All those arrangements have been the subject of enhancement over the last 12 to 18 months, as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the government, through the primary industries portfolio, is not only making a commitment to those key domestic demands because of the severity of the drought but is also taking steps in this budget to deal with the increasing scope in the food processing area for export. We know that is one of the key areas that will help to drive the future prosperity of rural Australia, to build what is a major opportunity in the food processing industry and the export of those products. The clean food export program is being continued, and there is an allocation in the budget of $2 million towards that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise both the key concerns and needs of rural Australia. I think that is a view that is shared across the community. The member for Murray referred to the fact that churches and others in the cities are not responsive enough to that need and what is perceived, I guess, to be an emphasis on some of the particular requirements of families in cities. I take it that is the gist of the comment that was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grew up in rural Australia, in country New South Wales,  but I can say I have lived in the cities for quite a while now, and certainly in my own church and others I know we have had major collections relating to the needs of rural Australia and a major focus on the needs of parts of rural Australia. I think most of us who live in the cities these days are very conscious not only of the impact of the drought on farm families but of what that does to communities in the country towns that service those farms as well. Obviously if there is a cash drought for farm families it affects the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) related to the drought package made it clear that the measures were focused not only on the needs of the farm families but on the infrastructure, the businesses and so on that go to service those in the country towns. That is important. Everyone knows that the demands in rural Australia are substantial and will continue to be substantial. The budget estimates themselves take account of the fact that the ongoing severity of the drought is going to have a continuing impact, particularly on export markets and on the trade position. We all hope that will be overcome sooner than later but, as the member for Murray points out, it is a substantial issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1995-96, under the Foreign Affairs and Trade allocation, I wish to firstly speak about one specific commitment, which is to reopen the Australian embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, which is a specialised item in this year's budget referred to in the budget papers. It is set down to happen officially on 18 July, subject to no early election or no other factors intervening, in the presence of one or two ministers, but with a representative to not be formally appointed as ambassador, as opposed to charge d'affaires, until a little later in the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome very much this particular focus and this particular proposal in the 1995-96 budget. I believe it is only fair, proper and reasonable that Australia re-establish its embassy level links in Beirut, Lebanon to reflect the peace process in the Middle East but also to reflect the real progress that Lebanon is making against very difficult odds in circumstances which are extraordinarily difficult relating to its neighbours, most notably both Israel and Syria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, there is a spirit alive and well in Lebanon to get on with the job of rebuilding Beirut and rebuilding Lebanon. I salute that spirit and hope that the embassy, on its reopening in the same building as it was in before its closure in the middle of the civil year, will reward Australian promotional effort not only on the diplomatic front but also in helping to boost our trade to the Middle East and our trade to Lebanon, where we have a small live sheep trade and other items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make is that the whole focus and effort of the trade component of Foreign Affairs and Trade must be mindful of the fact that Australia is losing market share in certain key growing Asian markets. It is not quite good enough to say that, as the Asian economies move on and further mature and develop from their very small economic bases, they are going to show huge growth figures; their needs are going to be different, and that explains justifiably, in the eyes of some, why it is okay for Australia to lose market share in some of these key Asian economic tigers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that there can be absolutely no complacency about our trading and export efforts to Asia and elsewhere. We hear the government referring to it repeatedly. I make the point that, when one analyses the figures on any objective and properly comparative criteria&mdash;as I, particularly in a paper in January this year, have said; and as, more recently, the shadow minister for foreign affairs has said&mdash;one can have no doubt that we are losing our market share, and that is a matter of legitimate concern. In the context of the allocation of these appropriations for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I want to see attention brought to bear on that circumstance, on the need to further diversify our export efforts, and on the need to, in fact, lift our game against some pretty nasty competition coming from around the Pacific and elsewhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I want to make in the time available is to refer to the foreign aid component in the budget, which has again fallen as a percentage of GDP and, of course, falls well short of the allocation of the policy objective laid down at the national ALP conferences in Hobart. There is a need to be very careful about Australian taxpayer dollars being used on aid. There is, of course, a case for foreign aid: it does indeed help Australia and does help many people in the world who are disadvantaged, and I am, in general terms, supportive of the foreign aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The targeting, efficiency and effectiveness of that aid program is something for legitimate scrutiny by this parliament and, indeed, by the minister for overseas aid, most notably in his comments with regard to one particular international organisation. I highlight the fact that, as a percentage of GDP, aid has fallen well short of the government's own foreign aid objectives. We must work harder to drive those foreign aid dollars just as far as they can be driven to produce the maximum effective outcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to respond to the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) in relation to the foreign affairs and trade portfolio appropriations. I join with him by saying that I welcome the initiative relating to the reopening of the embassy in Beirut. I note from the actual budget measures that $3.76 million is provided towards this end in 1995-96, and $2.33 million is provided for 1996-97 in the forward estimates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the significant things about the reopening of the embassy in Beirut&mdash;which is something that all of us have been keen to encourage just as soon as the security situation permitted, and something the government has been committed to have occur this year&mdash;is that, as well as reopening the embassy, we are going to establish an Austrade office in the embassy in Beirut. That is a reflection of the fact that we do appreciate the opportunity to use the embassy in Beirut as a major gateway to build trade not only with Lebanon, but also with the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of things that has become clear in more recent times is that, as Lebanon goes through the process of restructuring after the devastation of the war that has occurred there, the opportunities to both invest in Lebanon and use that investment to extend more broadly into the region are very real indeed. Last Sunday, the Australian Lebanese Business Council had the launch of a trade mission it is taking to Lebanon to coincide with the reopening of the embassy. Again, that reflects the fact that Australian business people here&mdash;particularly those originally from the Lebanon who have come here and shown terrific enterprise in business&mdash;recognise that business here can play a very active part in that rebuilding process in Lebanon, with the range of demands and needs it has to rebuild infrastructure and the whole range of services from financial services through to water, electricity, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the launch of the Australian Lebanese trade mission last Sunday, business people were saying that the opportunities in Lebanon are as great as those in Vietnam, if we move in there early and play a real part, because of the strong connections Australia has with Lebanon and the great bilateral relationship that there is between the two peoples of the respective countries. We know that the demands that exist there are shared by countries right around that region, and that Australia is well regarded throughout the Middle East. I certainly share the view that, through our trade efforts, we can do substantially more to boost trade in the Middle East across a range of agricultural areas; but I do not limit the potential to agriculture alone: there is a whole range of service areas that are also potential opportunities for Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Farrer referred to a couple of other matters, including the area of foreign aid. It is correct to say that there is a marginal decline, as a percentage of GDP, in the foreign aid budget for this year&mdash;I think the actual figures are 0.34 to 0.33&mdash;but the dollar increase over this year, and the previous budget, highlights the government's ongoing commitment to the foreign aid program. That real dollar commitment has indeed been a substantial increase over those two years. That of course enables a well targeted, properly focused foreign aid program to be achieved. It also enables the government to maintain its clear commitment to the range of foreign aid needs that exist, be they in the immediate region or in Africa and other parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of trade with Asia, the fact is that over recent years there has been a massive increase in our commitment and representation within the Asia-Pacific region. We have not only opened additional Austrade offices but we have also had much greater commitment to our direct diplomatic representation in countries in the region. There has been a very strong focus on using that increased representation to further the trade opportunities that exist in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, from almost every facet of industry we talk about&mdash;whether it relates to Indonesia or other countries in the region&mdash;that that commitment is ongoing. Rarely a week goes by without major visits to Australia from business in those countries or delegations from here to countries in the region. Certainly the opportunities are there and we have to grasp them. We know that those countries are going to be competitive and to suggest that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is doing anything other than putting the proper focus on the Asia region, and the growth opportunities in the region, is absolutely wrong. I commend the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Main Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure which put forward the recommendation for the establishment of the second chamber. Part of the recommendation, and part of the reason for it, was that members of this House would have additional opportunity to speak on issues of importance, not just to them but to the nation as a whole. The whole purpose of this chamber was to extend the range of speakers, and yet we find in this budget debate that we have still had the gag applied and we have still had the guillotine applied. I want to make a formal complaint about that. It is totally inappropriate that this government should try to gag and guillotine discussion on the most important document to come before the parliament every year&mdash;that is, the budget. It affects every man, woman and child in this country. It is just further evidence of the authoritarian attitude of the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that members of the opposition have been prevented from speaking on the budget because of the gag and because of the guillotine.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that very few government members bothered to say a word on the budget. I can only assume that they are a bit ashamed of it. We have the figure being put forward in the budget of a surplus of $719 million, whereas the real deficit is certainly at least $8.2 billion. Of course, some people who have been analysing the budget suggest that it is as high as over $12 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ways that the government has falsely attained this so-called surplus is by the sale of assets, one of which is Dasfleet. It is interesting that this particular sale is a double con&mdash;while the government has applied to the budget the revenue, the funds that it is getting from the sale of Dasfleet, it is my understanding that it has not counted in that it is going to have to lease back the fleet to continue to provide the same service. So on the one hand it is going to sell it and that is counted in, but then it is going to have to pay to lease it back and I understand that that has not been included. </PARA>

The other thing is that in terms of the budget, in terms of the so-called surplus which is achieved by the sale of assets, the people of Australia should be very much aware that this is a very high taxing government, that over the next two years alone taxation revenue will increase by $6 billion. That is an additional $2.4 billion in 1995-96 and an additional $3.6 billion in 1996-97. This is the biggest single tax hike since the Whitlam government. Labor specialises in being a high taxing government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point again that the surplus in the budget is a false surplus. It has been obtained artificially by the sale of assets. If assets were to be sold, the money obtained from them should not be put in just to wipe out a deficit in one year but should be paid off the debt of the Commonwealth. The debt of the people of Australia should have been reduced by the sale of Dasfleet, by the sale of Qantas and by the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, when that occurs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the actual matters relating to Comcar, most of the major announcements relating to the restructuring of Comcar were taken in last year's budget or in earlier management decisions. There are no matters pertinent to this year's budget that directly affect Comcar operations at all. I know from experience, and from what I get told in New South Wales, that the basic numbers of Comcar drivers that were spelt out as required have been reached and there have not been anything other than voluntary redundancies that achieved that number over a period of time with the natural process of people taking those packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, it is an issue that the minister and the government continue to take seriously. I will certainly relay the general concerns that the member for Cowper raised about that particular area to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker). I make a comment generally on the asset sales question, given that the member for Cowper raised that. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) indicated in question time last week, in answering a question about the accounting of asset sales and the arrangements that apply to those, the process that we are following in this year's budget is absolutely no different from that which was followed when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was the Treasurer of Australia, or that undertaken by other governments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in this parliament, and arguably in the last couple of parliaments, there has been an increasing move towards bipartisanship in terms of the defence portfolio. Whilst in the context of this budget that trend will continue, can I say to you and to those opposite&mdash;in particular, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Bevis)&mdash;that that does not mean that we will not disagree around the edges in terms of the defence debate. We will continue to home in on the issues as we think they are appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would make is that that does not indicate that in any way the opposition is policy bankrupt in terms of the defence portfolio. Far be it from that. I heard the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) in this place last week, in the context of a particular debate, make that point. I say to the parliamentary secretary, and I hope he will convey this to the minister, that initiatives will emerge from the coalition, the opposition, at an appropriate time of our making in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, here we are faced with an outlay of $9.92 billion. But if you include the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young Endeavour</EMPHASIS> and cultural and recreational programs, that goes out to a little under $11 billion. Those increases have increased the percentage from eight to 8.1 per cent of government outlays. That is the sort of percentage that ministers and the parliamentary secretary would use. That is as a result of some arithmetic gymnastics and adjustments within the department that I need not go into in the time available. However, I think that the most important point to make is that that represents 2.0 per cent of GDP. Argue about it or not, Parliamentary Secretary, that is the lowest that this country has experienced in our history&mdash;two per cent of GDP. That must, of course, put up signs around the place that we need to consider that and look at that in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One element in these arithmetic gymnastics is the increase of $15 million for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> compensation. As the parliamentary secretary would know, I have argued the case for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> compensation for a long time, and once again I have to compliment both the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel on their initiatives in that area. I particularly ask the parliamentary secretary to reinforce the point that the outstanding claims&mdash;those claims made after 1 December 1988&mdash;need to be settled as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of asset sales, which of course are going to become an increasing element in the Defence budget, we would like to see some substantive progress in terms of the sale of ASTA and in terms of the AIDC. The parliamentary secretary might make some comment, bearing in mind that they hold a 50 per cent shareholding in the Australian Submarine Corporation, about just where that is heading and how quickly it might be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other element that I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary to address is the sale of an asset which is not mentioned in the budget papers. There is a question mark about the Nomad aircraft. Those Nomad aircraft are sitting on the ground at the army aviation centre in Oakey. They have moved absolutely nowhere in the last five or six months. There are question marks about airworthiness, and I would ask the parliamentary secretary to make a comment on that. </PARA>

There are some outstanding claims which were the subject of an offer from the government and which are still under negotiation. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has made clear on the public record his desire to see that matter progressed to a satisfactory outcome, and I understand that it is a matter that is currently in his consideration. It is something that I would hope will be taken forward to a conclusion sooner rather than later, and I am sure he does too. As with all of these matters revolving around litigation, it is not always possible to put a finite time on it, but it is clear that this government has moved much further than any government since the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> disaster to try to ensure some justice for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as asset sales generally are concerned, as they affect Defence, there have been a number of assets that have been identified for disposal; but it has not been the top of the market, as it were, to sell many of those assets. Defence is keen to ensure that it does get a good return on those assets, and I would anticipate that given the change in the broad economic climate we will see some of those assets to which the member for Groom referred being able to be put on the market and realised during the course of the current financial year.

It also represents about two per cent of GDP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the percentage of GDP is often used as a yardstick. I have made it very plain, for some time, that I have never regarded percentage of GDP as a dramatically useful measure for defence effectiveness. It may have some use when you are trying to compare across national boundaries. But even there it is very limited, because it is a percentage of a fluctuating figure, and that does not produce too much in terms of actual hardware or personnel on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just illustrate that. I have just come from a lunch with visiting members of the Japanese parliament. The gentlemen sitting beside me were talking about defence matters. Bear in mind that Japan has what is the third largest defence force in the world&mdash;it is, arguably, the second largest, if you take account of what has happened in the Soviet Union. The gentleman sitting beside me said, `How much do you spend on defence? What percentage of GDP?' I said, `Two per cent.' He said, `Oh, that is twice as much as we spend.' There is the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is two per cent. It also happens to be maintaining defence commitments in all but real terms. There has been only a very slight reduction in defence outlays in the last year. I should not let the opportunity pass without noting that, on the last occasion, the opposition did have a formal policy on defence. At the last election, the opposition undertook to reduce outlays on defence by $200 million beyond the cuts which we were programming. The two per cent figure is not one I would rest on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Appropriation Bill (No. 2) appropriates a sum of $4,365 million for the year ending 30 June 1996. The bill primarily deals with payments to the states and capital works and services. Payments to the states authorised by the proposed new act must be made on the terms and conditions that are, from time to time, determined in writing as being the terms and conditions applicable to payments to states under the act. They must be paid in the amounts, and at the times, that are determined in writing by the minister. As in the case of Appropriation Bill (No. 1), there is a provision for this act to be updated, should the Financial Management and Accountability Bill be enacted before 30 June 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debating the Appropriation Bill (No.1), I have already canvassed the excessive spending and the excessive use of higher taxes that are a hallmark of this government. I have also dealt with the growth in debt that is also a hallmark of this government, and I do not propose to go over these issues again. However, we will not let this government forget its fraudulent budget in the coming months. This government will have to go to the people knowing that nothing it says can be believed and that none of its promises are credible. It will be at that time that the Australian people will pass their verdict on this high taxing, self-indulgent government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to make a few comments, as we are debating these measures cognately, on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1995-96. This particular bill appropriates funding of $144.46 million for the year ending 30 June 1996. There may also be some additional appropriations for increases in salaries. The extra amounts may be issued only for the purpose of increase in salaries and in payments in the nature of salary, and the minister must report the amount so issued to the parliament. If the description of the purpose of an appropriation refers to net appropriation, then this is taken to provide that any moneys received may be credited to the item, on the conditions agreed to by the minister and the presiding officer responsible for the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also allows for any money in relation to the Senate or the House of Representatives in excess of specific appropriations to be charged to an advance to the Speaker of the House of Representatives or to an advance to the President of the Senate. After allowing for any repayments, the total expenditure must not exceed the amount appropriated for the advances. As with the other two appropriation bills, this bill allows for modifications to reflect the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, should it commence before 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is concerned with the running of the parliament and the funding of its operations. We must, however, always be aware that many of our fellow Australians are still doing it tough. We must always be on our guard so that parliament, while fulfilling its role as a democratic institution in contact with people, is not wasteful and extravagant of taxpayers' money. While agreeing to this bill now, the coalition will gladly be committed to ensuring that the parliament is not wasteful and self-indulgent. </PARA>
