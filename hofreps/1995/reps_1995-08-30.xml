It is therefore perfectly appropriate for me to direct some remarks, which I am doing, in support of that dissent motion to the reasons why the member for Flinders moved it in the first place.

I tell the House this: every Liberal and every National Party member of this House will vote in support of the integrity of the member for Chisholm when we get a chance to in a few minutes time.

It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having received the call from the Chair, a motion to suspend standing orders may be moved by any Member without notice, but to be passed it must be carried by an absolute majority of all Members (75 votes in a House of 148 Members).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) was perfectly in order to stand at that point in the proceedings this morning and move his motion of dissent.

It is in that context that he quite properly acted to move the suspension. The dissent from the ruling of the Speaker then flowed from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I might add, that dissent comes under standing order 100, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If any objection is taken to any ruling of the Speaker, such objection must be taken at once, and a motion of dissent, to be submitted in writing, moved, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to the House, and debate thereon shall proceed forthwith.</PARA>

As far as they are concerned, you can get out there, say anything you like, be called to book for it in this place, then get up and mislead on a personal explanation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument put in favour of this dissent motion&mdash;an argument presented by the fellow on the other side of the House&mdash;if I can follow their arguments through all of this, is that this is a legitimate tactic on his part to stop something unprecedented. It is not unprecedented, of course. On the last occasion somebody went outside the chamber and made a statement about a set of propositions&mdash;it was actually in relation to one of your predecessors&mdash;that person came back into this House and effectively got up and gave a personal explanation which said, `I never said it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question here is&mdash;the opposition has this view and I would have thought it was an exceptionally stupid attitude for the opposition to take&mdash;whether it is legitimate, if somebody happens to be on their scrapers in this place speaking, for somebody to stand up, call a point of order and then move a suspension of standing orders motion. Who do you think has a majority in this place? It is this side of the House. If we set up that standard of behaviour which you invite us to, who are the people most likely to miss out as a result of it&mdash;people on the side of the House with the numbers, or people on the side of the House without the numbers? So you want to introduce into standing orders the notion that it is okay, when anybody is on their feet in this place making any point, for somebody to stand up, get the eye of the chair, say `Point of order,' and then move a suspension motion? Is this an acceptable parliamentary practice, acceptable standing orders?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition leader and then the Leader of the National Party made much of what went behind the proposition that caused the Manager of Opposition Business to get up and move that motion. What was the motivation behind it? It was very simple, since they challenge that motivation. The motivation behind it was simply to establish in this place proper treatment of the processes of personal explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A personal explanation is not an occasion to get up and mislead the House about what it is you have said. The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) is making an art form of that&mdash;both yesterday and on the previous occasion. It is entirely legitimate, without a suspension of standing orders motion to be moved against it, for somebody to stand up in this House and declare when there has been that level of misleading, when he gets up and says, `Oh, no. I didn't say anything about Carmen Lawrence, connecting her with the suicide of Penny Easton at all. No, no. I didn't say anything about that.' Then Mr Keating quotes directly from him. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If she had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might still be alive today.</PARA>
<PARA>That was an extraordinary statement, but to then get up and deny that he was making any connection between Carmen Lawrence and the death of Penny Easton! How can you possibly interpret those words? You went and got one little, selective element of the quote when there was a whole panoply of material after that in which he was linking her in by every possible means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meaning of that sentence I just read out is, without question, a linkage between the two. The member for Chisholm gets up in this chamber and makes a statement that, as far as he is concerned, he never made any linkage between them. He took out a quote which was then qualified to the nth degree as justifying his position. The point of a personal explanation is not a debate. The point of a personal explanation is to express the truth of a matter to the House, to correct the misleading statements about you. It is not an opportunity to get up in this place and make yet another misleading statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm did it again yesterday when he got up and said that, somehow or other, when I had been suggesting to him that he had been in conference with the Liberal Party to set up this wretched political royal commission in Western Australia, I had been mistaken on that&mdash;that he was not consulting; he was `liaising'.

In fact, he was given such advance notice that this motion was presumably typed out&mdash;obviously not under the desk&mdash;in the minister's office. The minister has had time to prepare copious notes and quotes. Mr Speaker, it does indicate that you gave him advice quite some time before 9.30 this morning as to what your decision would be, whereas on this side of the House no such notification was given.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already gone to these issues. There is a very specific requirement and absolute obligation upon members of parliament, when they stand before this House to correct the fact that somebody has produced some misleading statement and has misrepresented them personally, to come into this place and to speak the truth&mdash;the whole of it. If they merely want to engage in debate, there are appropriate forms of the House to engage in debate. If they want to get up and take issue with a point made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), or any other minister or any other member of the House, they are entitled to get up and make those points. That is the point of personal explanations: in ensuring that absolute clarity is established, they get up, they make their point and that is it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What members are not entitled to do in that explanation is mislead the House. The last person to do that in the way in which the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) did was the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and the House dealt with him in exactly the same way that the honourable member for Chisholm is being dealt with here. When the right honourable member stood up on that occasion and said something totally contrary to what he had obviously said previously, which had caused the Speaker's ire, he was appropriately dealt with by the House for having misled it. That has happened again in this case. What the member said was this&mdash;and I have made most of these points, fortunately, in the previous debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This morning at a doorstep interview my specific comments were: `I don't think you could say that Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton.' It is completely the opposite of what the Prime Minister said. For the record, I do not say, and have not said, that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, that is exactly what the honourable member did say. The Prime Minister quoted with absolute accuracy the remarks that the honourable member made. These are the comments that the Prime Minister cited&mdash;perfectly accurate comments from exactly the same interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, anyone that knows anything about suicide would know it requires a trigger, and it would appear that the tabling of the petition was the trigger that caused Penny Easton to suicide.</PARA>
<PARA>Understandably, the commentator went on to say that Dr Wooldridge went further, blaming Dr Lawrence directly by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If she had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might still be alive today.</PARA>
<PARA>You cannot get any clearer than that: `If she had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton would still be alive today', which was immediately preceded by a pseudo-medical judgment about the triggers which cause suicide. These are the quotes of the honourable member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he wants to get up in a point of debate and say that he also said at some other point in his remarks that he did not think she killed her even though it is contradicted by that, that is an appropriate thing to do in a debate. But, if you are going to get up here and make the point and use the forms of the House to establish the absolute truth of the matter in regard to your personal behaviour, what you do is you get up and you present the whole truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member was in a position to do that, and he did not do it. He misled the House with the position that he took. Unfortunately, it is becoming a pattern of behaviour as far as the honourable member is concerned because he did it again yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was suggesting just then that I had said that we were constantly having discussions. It is completely untrue. I said we were liaising&mdash;it is totally different. It was 2 1/2 weeks before the royal commission. You cannot accept the truth because it does not fit in with what you want to believe.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a personal explanation again. What does that bounce off but a series of interviews that he gave in which he said things like: `We've been liaising with Richard Court', `We've been looking for the best way to do it', `We've agreed that up till now it would be better if it was a federal independent inquiry.' So you now have to go back to Richard Court and say, `Our options are closing fast. It's now up to you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a very revealing interview with the honourable member in April. It actually establishes a pattern of quite deep collusion between the federal opposition and Richard Court on spending these millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. Again he misled the House when he got up and made a personal explanation. Not only was it an inadvertent accident, it is now becoming routine for the honourable member for Chisholm to stand up on personal explanations and make misleading statements about his own conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is precisely for these reasons therefore that we have moved this motion&mdash;obviously in anticipation that at some point in time the Speaker was going to say something about it in this chamber and that would open up the fact that the chamber has an opportunity to respond to its misleading as it sees fit at the time. We happen to regard this as the most appropriate means of responding to it. For those reasons we move this motion on the honourable member for Chisholm. </PARA>

<PARA>It is quite clear under that standing order that the member who raises the question of privilege, who in this case was the Prime Minister, should in turn move any ensuing motion. In this particular case, whilst the Prime Minister raised the question of privilege with the Speaker, it is the Leader of the House who is moving the motion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"that the House condemns the Government for its abuse of due Parliamentary process".</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition unreservedly rejects the government motion. This is a tactic by the government to muddy the waters on the Carmen Lawrence affair. It is a gross abuse of parliamentary processes and should be rejected for that reason and for that reason alone. The forms of the House are well known on these matters. As the matter was raised as a matter of privilege by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a few days ago, it is sensible to refer to convention and practice in this place in dealing with such issues. As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the normal arrangement is that the Speaker, upon receiving a matter of privilege, or a matter of privilege being put to the Speaker, would normally reserve his opinion on it, take further advice as to whether or not the matter might meet the criteria for a breach of privilege and then report back to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the procedure that has been followed because the House considers any allegation of a breach of privilege to be a very serious matter. It is serious because it goes to the proper functioning of the House. For those who are not used to the terminology, the word `privilege' in this case refers to the rights and entitlements of members to carry on their work as members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important, as a matter of our democratic process, that when a person is elected a member of parliament, they are able to represent the voters in what they do as a local member both inside and outside the parliament. If somebody tries to stop a person carrying out their functions as a member of parliament, the parliament in the past has been very jealous of the rights of members because of that basic democratic principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When matters have been raised in the past, the Speaker has taken proper advice and then reported back to the chamber as to whether a prima facie case has been made out. In other words, the Speaker has come back to the House and said, `I think there is something in this but it should be referred to a committee outside the heat of the chamber, outside the normal heat of party politics, so that members can sit down behind closed doors and assess whether this particular matter would represent a breach of privilege.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament has very careful forms to ensure that we do not treat privilege in a trivial, party political way. I know politicians are often accused of playing to the galleries and enjoying having the cameras on us. But when it comes to this very important matter of privilege there are particular processes established for the very good reason that we consider it so important we have a special process to deal with it&mdash;the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges&mdash;and that is the proper way for these things to be treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has made much of an alleged precedent in respect of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). I must say it is not much of a precedent because those opposite were in power when the so-called precedent was established. To me, it is not so much a precedent that goes to the substance of the matter but is only one of many precedents where they have abused their power in the past. That, quite frankly, is about all you can say about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only substantive thing you could say to dismiss this so-called precedent is that it was a matter that went to reflections on the chair. That is very different from allegations about who said what and whether they were gilding the lily in the normal to and fro between the government and the opposition in the House. The normal process is that the Speaker would come back to the House after having looked at the matter and would basically say, `I think there is something in it. There is a prima facie case. Therefore the matter should go off to the committee.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement we had from the Speaker today as to whether the particular issue before him, raised by the Prime Minister, was one which qualified as establishing a prima facie case was an interesting one. The Speaker said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statement made by the honourable member may be untrue, however&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the particularly relevant piece&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there are clearly differences of opinion in respect of the remarks of the honourable member, and particularly in respect of the conclusions to be drawn from his remarks. I can understand and appreciate the different conclusions that have been reached.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Speaker said. He did not come in here and say, `This is pretty obviously a case where someone has misled the House.' He said that this was a sort of garden variety case where there are differences of opinion as to what was said, who said it, when, and what the implications of those remarks are. In other words, the Speaker did not say that a prima facie case had been clearly established. In fact, he said to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that very simple reason, that this allegation did not even pass the first test, it should obviously be refuted. That is why the motion, which really hangs on it, should be rejected and why our amendment should be put. That is the first point. On the Speaker's own words, the prima facie case has not been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that, if the case had been established, the normal course of events is not to have the matter debated in here but to send it off to a committee. That is a very sensible course of action, because it takes the matter out of the political process to some extent so that it can be properly reviewed. The reason this matter has not been sent off to a committee is that it would not stand up if it were put under the microscope in the Committee of Privileges. The truth is that, for all the party political differences there are, the Committee of Privileges, when it gets behind closed doors and is charged with looking after the rights and entitlements of members, generally has a record of properly reviewing and assessing the precedent and weighing up the merits of the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not sending this matter off to the committee because the merits of this case are absolutely zilch. There are no merits to this case, as the Speaker's statement to the House has made very clear. This is not a case based on the merits; this is a case based on a political play by the government in respect of the Carmen Lawrence affair. That is particularly obvious because it started a couple of days ago when the Prime Minister, at the start of question time, got up and attacked the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). I suppose I must have had a premonition about this because I got up yesterday and asked if the Speaker, in considering the Prime Minister's original claim in the House, would also consider whether or not it was a spurious claim for privileges&mdash;not that there have been spurious claims for precedence, but the Speaker himself has been attacking people on our side for raising so-called spurious points of order. Yet here was, on the face of it, as clear as you like, a spurious claim of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter is baseless. It does not follow the proper form. The reason it does not follow the proper form is that obviously it is a tactical ploy. The tactical ploy is one of the many defences we have had from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). The truth is that she did not tell the truth to the Western Australian parliament two or three years back on the Penny Easton affair, and it is now patently obvious that that is the case. The government has a policy&mdash;a tactic, if you like&mdash;basically to tough it out, to maintain the minister in her position regardless of the fact that the evidence is totally against her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They virtually had a shadow cabinet meeting of the Labor Party in Western Australia when they decided that they would stand up and give evidence about what happened so as to contradict what the minister had to say. It must be the clearest case of a minister misleading the parliament that we have had in many years in Australian politics, and absolutely every last person knows it. The number of ministers lined up against her are about eight to nil. The fact is that she did not tell the truth when she was speaking to the Western Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is running all these defences. They decided the day before that they would run this absolutely baseless attack on the member for Chisholm. He is going to speak after me. He will go through, word by word, exactly what he said, what was said in the parliament, what the Prime Minister said and what he said in the personal explanation. He will prove absolutely beyond doubt that this is a frivolous and baseless claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other tactic that they ran yesterday&mdash;also a muddying the waters tactic&mdash;was to attack the senior barrister who is assisting the royal commission in Western Australia. This was a really over-the-top attack. I have had a bit to do with the government when it comes to the rights of Australian women and the sort of debate that we have about it. This government is full of talk about the rights of Australian women. They made a conference decision 12 months ago, for example, to provide a quota for women to enter into parliament. It has been very interesting to watch how they themselves have repudiated their own quota system in the last 12 months, as many women of merit have been rejected in the factional power plays of the men of the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm parades himself as your local family doctor who knows a little about psychiatry. Of course, if he knows anything about psychiatry, as naturally he as your local family doctor would, he would know that the petition could trigger Penny Easton's suicide. He expects that that should be just accepted&mdash;that that stands alone; that it means nothing and is just something out there in the ether&mdash;while his other colleagues are going around saying that the royal commission is inquiring into the Minister for Human Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you put the two arguments together, it is quite clear that the message the opposition wanted to get out was that the minister had a hand in the death of Penny Easton. He comes in here and unctuously says in his personal explanation, `Of course I never meant that.' The fact is that, just like the right honourable member for New England, who thought he could slip-slide out of these things years ago and was discovered, the member for Chisholm has been discovered. The public record shows what he said. By trying to change it in here in a personal explanation and by trying to get his leader to change it for him as well, he has misled the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole situation raises the question: if the member for Chisholm did not say that Penny Easton was done in by the Minister for Human Services and Health, then why did his leader feel constrained to have him in for a chat? Did his leader want to tell him that he thought he might have been saying these things, or did his leader want to say, `You've done a good job out there today. You've got the subliminal message out that Lawrence killed Easton. Keep it going. You go on the television as the nice young man, and we'll run the hardline downstairs.' That is what this is all about, and that is why this House should condemn the member for Chisholm for what he has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a lot from the Leader of the Opposition about standards. We have also heard a lot from the Leader of the Opposition about how the opposition had nothing to do with the Easton royal commission. He said, `It wasn't something that we were involved in. The Court government decided that this was an important matter.' The member for Chisholm has another interesting role as the agent of the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Chisholm condemned himself out of his own mouth in a personal explanation in the House on 29 August. The member for Chisholm should give up making personal explanations. He just gets further and further into the mire every time he tries to slip-slide his way out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm said that what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said about the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition being involved in the setting up of the Easton royal commission is completely untrue. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said we were liaising&mdash;it is totally different. It was 2 1/2 weeks before the royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA>So what have we got here? Some 2 1/2 weeks before the royal commission, the nice young GP was in Perth with the Liberal Party liaising about how to set up the Easton royal commission. What does `liaising' mean? Any dictionary will give you the definition of `liaising'. It is getting together in concert with people to get an outcome. Members of the Liberal Party were over in Perth saying precisely what they thought the Court government should do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the member for Chisholm was liaising, Mr Court said, `I may well have discussed the matter of the royal commission with John Howard, but he wasn't involved in the decision making.'

But don't say we're in favour of it&mdash;just say that we're just over here liaising with you.' This is a man who never went anywhere and never said anything.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was something that the Liberal Party thought was really important at the time. They thought about it for so long; it took them a couple years before they set it up. It just happened to be set up so that it would coincide with a federal election. These are people who want to tell you that truth is an absolute thing. When Mr Court was asked whether he had any discussions with the Leader of the Opposition or his agents on this matter, he said, `In the answer to the question in parliament, I said that I discussed the question with a number of people, but John Howard played no role in the establishment of the commission.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who were the people?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, is typical of the way we have seen the Liberals operate in the past when they have been in opposition. When they get a bit of a smell of blood in their nose and they think they might have a chance to win an election, out comes the old bag of dirty tricks&mdash;except nowadays, they have some nice new apprentices. The Leader of the Opposition was right up to his ears in this. The right honourable member for New England has been right up to his ears in these things before and now they are training the new generation. The nice young member for Chisholm will get out there and he will be right up to his neck in it, too. He will smile at you on television and he will say here in a few minutes, `Who, me? I wouldn't do something like this.' But what was he doing liaising with them? How was he acting in concert with them to get this outcome of setting up the royal commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it was the same thing when they liaised with Garfield Barwick. They liaised with old Gar, and they got old Gar to give them private decisions, private advice about what he should tell the Governor-General. They went and liaised with John Kerr. They would say they were only out there in Yarralumla in 1975 liaising with John Kerr. They had nothing to do with making up John Kerr's mind for him. They were not making him any promises. They were just out there liaising, in the same way that they are liaising with Richard Court to set up this royal commission, for exactly the same Liberal Party, old boy network outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has got the hide, the absolute gall, to stand up in here and in public and say he wants absolute truth. Let us hear a little of the truth about these liaisons. Of course, it would be interesting to hear a little about the truth of Mr Court's liaisons and why this royal commission was set up in the first place. Why did Mr Court have such a continuing interest in the Easton marriage problems? Mr Court has drawn up these royal commission terms of reference very adroitly, so that on issues such as that, which are issues of national interest, he says, `Well, you can't address them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he set up this crook royal commission in the first place, they trolled the country to find a commissioner. No-one with any sense would take it on. They finally got a commissioner and then they hired a member of the family to be counsel assisting. We have heard the member for Flinders say, `Isn't this terrible? They're casting aspersions on Ms Vanstone. It is just unfortunate that she is related to Senator Vanstone.' I suppose it would be unfortunate for anyone to be related to Senator Vanstone. But what we ought to think about is: where is the propriety from these people who talk about propriety? Why didn't Senator Vanstone suggest to her sister-in-law that it might not be a good idea to take this job on? She congratulated her on getting the job. We have all seen on the public record that she congratulated her on getting the job. She then went to dinner at her mother's place,</PARA>
<PARA>and I suppose they never talked about it. But she thought it was pretty good that her sister-in-law got the job. Let us look at what Senator Vanstone said in the Senate on 9 March this year about justice and the perception of justice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A finding of appearance of bias at law will overturn a decision on the basis that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done. The threshold for overturning a decision is therefore the appearance of bias. The question of whether actual bias was displayed need not be addressed. Confidence in the judicial system will be lost if there is a public perception of bias in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA>You can bet your life, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there will be a loss of confidence in royal commissions that have the same perception of bias. If these people had half a brain, if the Liberal Party had half a brain, if Senator Vanstone and her sister-in-law had half a brain, they would have counselled her not to take the job. But the truth is they could not find anyone to go and service this rotten, stinking, inquisitional royal commission. The dregs of the law took this job, not people of any substance.

This is not a motion based on any sort of precedence, as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) would have, for the case of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in 1986 was quite different. People should understand that this is the first time in a Western democracy, since Profumo, that a parliament has been misused for something like this: where a member has been censured on a personal explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An allegation has been made against me that I have misled the House in a personal explanation. That is the substance of this motion. And, although it was not the substance of the personal explanation I gave yesterday, it was also raised then. I will address both those issues, and I will address them in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, on Thursday 24 August 1995 my personal explanation read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today in the debate on the censure motion the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a number of allegations. There is one in particular on which I claim to have been misrepresented. He said that John Howard had suggested that I point out that Carmen Lawrence had killed Penny Easton. This morning at a doorstop interview my specific comments were: `I don't think you could say that Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton.' It is completely the opposite of what the Prime Minister said. For the record, I do not say, and have not said, that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death.</PARA>
<PARA>The doorstop interview to which that personal explanation refers was given that morning as I came into parliament. I was stopped and the first question I was asked was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is Carmen Lawrence responsible for Penny Easton's suicide?</PARA>
<PARA>I replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, anyone that knows about suicide would know that it requires a trigger and it would appear that the tabling of the petition was the trigger that caused Penny Easton to suicide. Now, a lot of people are responsible for the tabling of that petition. A lot of people have to take that responsibility, but there's also, there was one person at the top that appears to have to take some responsibility. So, I don't think you can say Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton, but I think you can say that, if she'd exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might be still alive today.</PARA>
<PARA>Then I was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, she is responsible for that woman's death?</PARA>

I think it's&mdash;any psychiatrist or psychologist will tell you that it is a trigger, usually, that sets off someone's suicide, and I think it' fairly clear that the tabling of the petition was the trigger for Penny Easton, which is very sad.</PARA>
<PARA>I stand by that comment totally. That comment is moderate, reasoned, accurate and backed up by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I would like to read to the House the finding of the inquiry by the coroner into the death of Penny Easton on 5 April 1993. It states:</PARA>

In a speech here in this place on Monday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got up, dripping with venom and vitriol, his eyes popping out, the veins bulging out of his head&mdash;you can dress him up in a Zegna suit, but he still looks a spiv&mdash;and the spiv was standing up there saying:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of my personal explanation goes to when the Prime Minister said that I had said she killed her. I could not have been more different in what I said. In fact, I specifically said, `I don't think you can say Carmen Lawrence killed Penny Easton.' So the Prime Minister chose to try to say black is white, and I made a personal explanation which was totally backed up by the facts. The second element of this is when I went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the record, I do not say, and have not said, Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death.</PARA>
<PARA>We have had half an hour of debate in this place on this specific motion, and on not one occasion has anyone on the opposite side been able to come up with anything I have said in five months on this issue to the effect that that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. With all the work of the National Media Liaison Service trawling through everything I have said, you have not been able to come up with a single occasion on which I have said such a thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My statement to this House was absolutely accurate. I have never said here or anywhere else that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. I have said and implied that Penny Easton's death might have been able to be prevented. They are two totally different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to the substance of what I was saying, it is a fact that suicide is a very complicated issue and it involves a multitude of factors. The government people were running around the galleries saying, `They've said this was the cause; they've said this was the only thing responsible.' Nothing could be further from the truth. Any suicide is a very sad thing and it is often precipitated by something that is the last straw. According to the coroner and the woman's mother, the simple fact is that this was the last straw. So it is accurate and reasonable to say that it was a factor. But that does not mean I have ever said Carmen Lawrence caused it. I do not say it, the opposition does not say it; but that is not the fact or the basis of what is going on here&mdash;the truthfulness of Dr Lawrence is. I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In half an hour of debate and with one more speaker, I challenge you&mdash;with all the resources of taxpayer-funded people to eavesdrop and listen to anything we say anywhere in the country&mdash;to come up with one occasion where I have said that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. You cannot do it. What I said in this House was absolutely accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing on which I have been charged is the personal explanation of yesterday. I was not really going to even dignify it with a reply but, given that the Leader of the House and the member for Watson (Mr McLeay) have both raised it, I will put on the record here in this House exactly what happened in the setting up of the royal commission. Yesterday, the Leader of the House said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member for Chisholm was saying that they were constantly involved in discussions.</PARA>
<PARA>It might not surprise people to know that the Premier of Western Australia and I are not at the top of each other's Christmas card list. The last time I remember speaking to him was in December 1993, when I bumped into him at a function&mdash;nearly two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, our offices were liaising. With $3 million of taxpayers' money, everything I say anywhere in the country is being monitored and anything he says anywhere in the country is being monitored. It would be sheer stupidity for us not to be in contact&mdash;through our offices, not directly&mdash;so that we do not give you the opportunity to send your media unit around the gallery trying to misrepresent what we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments that they have used for me saying that we were liaising referred to 18 April. The royal commission was set up on 9 May&mdash;three weeks later. I found out about the royal commission about half an hour after the press gallery did. I found out about the terms of reference when I read it in the paper. We had no discussions about the royal commission. If you want to check, three weeks before the discussion was: `Do we do it in Western Australia by a parliamentary inquiry, or do we do it in the Senate by a Senate inquiry?' If you read the full context of what I said on 18 April, it is quite clear that I am referring to whether we do it in the Western Australian parliament or whether we do it in the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had absolutely no role whatsoever in anything to do with the setting up of this royal commission. I was merely trying to act professionally and not give the Labor Party, with all their taxpayer-funded resources, the opportunity to misrepresent what we do, as they have been doing now. They are the bases of the two allegations against me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the real issue here though. The real issue here is that we have the Minister for Human Services and Health and we have to ask, `Can she can be believed?' We have a version of events that has been changing for the last three years. She cannot quite seem to get her lines right. She started off in 1992 saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lawrence didn't know about it beforehand. The only people who knew about it beforehand were the clerk of the House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">myself and Mr Easton&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, John Halden. Then she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I learnt the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon the tabling.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very different from what she has been saying lately. She has been saying, `Oh, I might have known about it. Yes, I did know about it in general terms, but I didn't have a detailed knowledge.' A detailed knowledge is very different from knowing the detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that should also be looked at here is the whispering campaign being run out of Dr Lawrence's office by Brenda Conroy around the galleries trying to besmirch the name of Keith Wilson. When Keith Wilson&mdash;a dignified, decent Christian gentleman&mdash;gets up and says, `Well, I remember differently', what happens? They send Brenda up into the gallery. She goes around and says, `Keith Wilson's not right; he had schizophrenia in the family. There is mental illness and mental instability in the family.' People in the parliamentary gallery know that is true. Ask</PARA>
<PARA>Paul McGeoch, who wrote about it. What did Dr Lawrence say when asked on 6WF about Brenda Conroy going around the gallery defaming Keith Wilson? She said, `No, I've checked this morning following the allegations and that certainly isn't true.' Ask the press gallery, ask Paul McGeoch and ask why Brenda Conroy is still working in her office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is about the financing of Carmen Lawrence's defence, unprecedented. The government is trying to have a bob both ways. They are trying to say, `It's not important; it's of no consequence. We're not going to listen to the results. But we will spend as much taxpayers' money as we need to try to stop her having to go there and give evidence.' This is about Notre Dame when, as minister for education, Carmen Lawrence said to the Western Australian parliament, `All dealings with Notre Dame are off', and then sent her deputy, Ian Taylor, to discuss a land deal about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is about Western Women. Carmen Lawrence said in the Western Australian parliament, `I've got no knowledge of Western Women at all', until a letter came up saying, `Dear Sandra' on a letterhead, complementing her on Western Women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is about the $5,000 in Dr Lawrence's imprest account. How many people in this place would have $5,000 in their account and not know it?</PARA>

But if I had $5,000 in my account, I would know it, and if any person out there had $5,000 in their account, they would know it. Carmen Lawrence had $5,000 of taxpayers' money in her account, which was put in in 1989. She only found it in 1992 and that was when Brian Burke was going to gaol for the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is about the outrageous slur on Anne Vanstone, for no other reason than that her brother is married to one of my colleagues. That lowers the whole debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have nothing to answer. This is unprecedented. It is the first time in a western democracy in over 30 years that anything like this has been done. It is not a motion based on facts; it is a motion based on the raw numbers in this House. I got no advance notice of this. Clearly, the government was given advance notice of this. Where is the fairness in that? Any fair-minded person will see that there is no basis to the facts of this whatsoever. The leader of my party has been  censured three times on trumped up charges.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the beautiful ironies of this place is that in a debate about truth&mdash;when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has said that truth is absolute and supreme&mdash;the one person who has been caught out red-handed not telling the truth and misleading this parliament is a member of John Howard's own front bench, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). It is one of the most beautiful ironies of this place and parliamentary politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm knows, and he has known it from day one, that for the opposition this has been business as usual&mdash;rorting business as usual, backdoor business as usual, conniving business as usual&mdash;to put together a conspiracy and the arrangements whereby, through the backdoor in Western Australia, the opposition could get at the Minister for Health and Human Services (Dr Lawrence). The member for Chisholm has the hide to come into the House today and confirm his sin, confirm the way in which he has misled this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His argument is essentially&mdash;and this is why the blood drained out of the face of every member opposite&mdash;to say that he has never said that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death. He said in this place on 24 August, `I have never, ever claimed that Carmen Lawrence caused Penny Easton's death.' But the honourable member for Chisholm said, at a doorstep in front of Parliament House just hours before that statement of 24 August, `If she had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might still be alive today.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the defence of the member for Chisholm is to put to the House that you can say it is 11.30 but you cannot say it is half past 11, that you can say there are a dozen members here but you cannot say there are 12 present in the chamber. That is the basis of the member for Chisholm's defence in this place, and it is a sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute sham that the member for Chisholm could so comprehensively mislead this parliament and not come into this debate and apologise&mdash;to do the decent thing and say, `I have been caught out red-handed.' When this matter was first raised at the shadow cabinet, he put up his hand and said, `Look, leave it to me. I am a GP. I have got street credibility on this matter. Everyone knows I have been a family doctor. You just leave it to me.' He then went up to the press gallery and said, `Look, I know what happened on this. I am a GP. I've had medical training. You can believe my account of what happened between Carmen Lawrence and Penny Easton. I'm going to tell you all about it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There the honourable member was, at the doorstep in front of parliament, saying, `If she'&mdash;Carmen Lawrence&mdash;`had exercised proper judgment, Penny Easton might still be alive today.' His defence before the parliament today is to say that it is coming up to 12 noon but you cannot say it is coming up to midday. It is an absolute sham by the member for Chisholm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the only instance. The member for Chisholm has form on this, and we have been reading the form guide. We heard about it yesterday at the end of question time, when he claimed in yet another personal explanation that he had not been involved in discussions with Richard Court about setting up a royal commission&mdash;only liaising. There had not been discussions&mdash;only liaison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm wants the House to believe that these were liaisons with their mouths closed, that this was liaison through ESP, that this was liaison where not a word was spoken, that this was liaison all through mental telepathy, that this was liaison around an ouija board, that this was liaison where not one person said something to anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member wants us to believe that it was liaison through a seance where Michael Wooldridge, John Howard and Richard Court, with the incense burning in the background, the lights dim and the ouija board in the middle, all held hands and liaised and that somehow through this process of unspoken liaison, through mental telepathy, the message got through that the federal opposition wanted Richard Court to set up a royal commission into Carmen Lawrence. This is the quality of the argument that is being presented to the House by the member for Chisholm. It is appalling. It is disgraceful. It is an absolute fraud on the intelligence of every person in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, the honourable member said in his earlier remarks, and I hope everyone heard this, `There were no discussions. I have not seen Richard Court since we were at a Christmas party a few years ago, but there was liaison between our offices.' The member for Chisholm is now trying to have us believe that he would sit in his office and say to his private secretary, `You ring Richard Court's private secretary and tell them that we want a royal commission into Carmen Lawrence to be set up,' and Richard Court's private secretary would then have told Richard Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm would have us believe that the Liberal Party runs its affairs by chain letter, by a Chinese whisper. How gullible does he think we are? It is absolutely extraordinary for a member of John Howard's opposition to come into this place and say, `We don't have discussions; we have liaisons. We run the affairs of the Liberal Party and relations with a Liberal premier like a Chinese whisper, like a chain letter, where I tell my private secretary to tell Richard Court's private secretary.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm was talking about political history. I do not think there would be a time in the history of this parliament where a frontbencher has ever come in, in defence of himself, and had such a lend of the intelligence of every single member. Those opposite trying to defend this know it is indefensible. You know the way in which the Liberal Party works. The royal commission was set up because John Howard and Michael Wooldridge told Richard Court that they supported it, that they wanted it done and that it was the best way to get at Carmen Lawrence and satisfy their grubby, low based political motive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally unbelievable for the member for Chisholm to come in and say, `That happened a different way. If you play enough with words, if you argue that black is really white and white is really black, somehow I am innocent.' It is so ironic in this debate, in which we have heard sermons from the Leader of the Opposition saying that truth is supreme and truth is absolute, that the greatest debasing of truth and the greatest misleading of this parliament has come from one of his own frontbenchers: the member for Chisholm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It confirms again the way in which the establishment does business and the way in which they have always gone through the backdoor. They have always connived. They have always had their meetings at the Melbourne Club to plot against those in government, those who stand in their way. It is no different from the Tory establishment way of doing politics: always going through the backdoor, always lying, always misleading, never telling the truth. It has always been the case. The member for Chisholm is just moving and working in that longstanding tradition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It confirms beyond doubt the whole basis of the royal commission. The royal commission in Western Australia is a stew, and it has been that way since the first day of this debate. It is a rort. It is a loaded dice. It is a rigged wheel at the casino. Every time you throw the ball in, it comes up with Carmen Lawrence's number. That is the way they have organised this royal commission from the very first day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind members of the events that took place at the commencement of the parliamentary day at 9.30. At that time the Speaker ruled on the allegation made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of a breach of privilege on the part of the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) last Thursday. The Speaker, as we sat here and listened to his ruling, made it patently clear that no prima facie case of abuse of privilege existed against the member for Chisholm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, to our astonishment, the Speaker, at the conclusion of his remarks, allowed precedence for a motion to be moved by the government. In apparent contradiction of all that had gone before in his judgment, the Speaker left it open to the government to move either a motion of reference of the matter to the Privileges Committee or another form of motion, which we have before us, being a censure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question in the mind of the opposition or any objective observer that there was a prearranged plan of action between the Speaker and the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Watson. Of course, I was referring to the officers of the parliament, not the clerks in any way. The minister for health is in desperate trouble and has created enormous problems for the government for which it sees no way out other than to attack the opposition and to attack the Marks royal commission. The vilification of the commission started last week so as to lay the groundwork for the government to reject any of its findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the member for Watson tell us today that the commission is a vile, rotten, stinking inquisition and that the dregs of the law took the jobs. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) followed that up with similar language. The government is throwing aside any concept of precedent, convention, fairness or decency and attacking the commission with the most violent of language. In doing so, they have particularly seized on counsel assisting the inquiry, Ann Vanstone QC, and impugned her reputation and, in doing so, have breached a very important principle of the parliament and the community at large, that a person is not to be attacked on the basis of family association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, for all its rhetoric about the rights of women or the rights of a person to a fair hearing, has attacked Ann Vanstone QC, whose reputation as a lawyer stands very high in Adelaide. The government can produce no evidence to justify an attack on Vanstone QC other than by way of family association. Does that mean the government would allow us to attack Justice McHugh of the High Court if we were so disposed, and we are not? I have read some of his judgments at length and I have a great deal of respect for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice McHugh of the High Court rules time and time again on government actions and constitutional matters whilst his wife is a minister of the government. There is nothing wrong with that. We have never suggested it and we don't now. The fact is the government believes there is one rule in regard to us not alleging bias on the basis of family association and another for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask a member of the government to stand up and tell us it is okay to attack anyone on the basis of family association. That is how desperate the government has become. You cannot see it, can you? You cannot see yourselves being dragged down by the actions of the minister for health. The Prime Minister has locked you in. You are so cowardly in the cabinet and caucus rooms that you dare not challenge his determination to ride this out. You know very well how the community at large regards the propensity of the minister for health not to tell the truth in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ask time and time again in this House for the minister for health to repeat her comments made outside the House, particularly at the National Press Club in April. She refuses to do so. We continually ask the Prime Minister whether or not it is a requirement for his ministers to tell the truth. He refuses even to concede that point. We ask the Prime Minister time and time again whether he will feel bound by the findings of the Marks royal commission. He refuses to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that is simply because if there is an adverse finding against the minister for health he will reject it. Of that there is not a shadow of doubt. The Prime Minister keeps insisting that the minister for health be given her day at the commission and judgment should be suspended until she gives her evidence, whilst at the same time proclaiming that he will not be bound by the findings of the Marks royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vilification of the commission and those associated with it is just part of the government's attempt to defend the minister for health.

The member for Chisholm has very ably defended himself today and revealed the censure motion for the nonsense that it truly is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Watson, in ridiculing Ann Vanstone QC, said that it was impossible to imagine that she and the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, had not talked about the commission at their mother's place over dinner. The logical extension of that is: does Anne Keating, as chief of United Airlines, discuss aviation policy with her brother the Prime Minister at their mother's place over dinner? Do you see where you have led this whole debate? You are allowing aspersions to be cast on individuals who are beyond question and whose sense of propriety nobody would question, because you want to attack the commission before it hands down its findings on the minister for health. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, I was speaking about a proposal by David Packham and Nigel Tapper. This was something that would be quite revolutionary with regard to the greenhouse effect. I would like to read part of their paper:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The perception has been generated that the apparent global warming over the last 200 years has largely been brought about by increased carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations in the atmosphere creating a greenhouse effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that there is little doubt that some global warming has occurred and the values discussed have been around 1-2(o)C.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Various mathematical models have been created and run on very large computers in an attempt to determine the relationship between CO(2) (and other gasses) and global temperature change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The connection between CO(2), greenhouse effect, global warming and various likely effects (e.g. sea level rise) has become so definitive that public policy is responding.</PARA>
<PARA>And this is their view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CO(2)&mdash;warming scenario has been propounded very strongly by various schools of atmospheric scientist, some climate modellers and most of the environmental movement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more cautious view has been put forward by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (see Zillman 1993)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even a casual examination of the computer models yield considerable uncertainties and a large number of approximations and assumptions so that some considerable doubt must exist in the model outputs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that only two of the models currently running (University of Colorado, and the UK Meteorological Office) are capable of adequately including the effect of smoke and dust particles in the atmosphere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been observed that certain large volcanic eruptions have cooled the earth's temperature (generally by about 0.5(o)C) and that the sulphate particles generated by power production and industrialisation may also have caused some cooling. (Zillman 1993:11).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No model has taken into account the effect of biomass or forest burning even though biomass burning may inject several times more particulate into the atmosphere than volcanic activity. However, it is possible that they have a shorter residence time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is becoming clear that the most likely natural (pre-European) fire frequency for Australia is around about once every ten years for perhaps 10% of 30% of our total land. There are recent studies that would strongly suggest the same 10% for European Mediterranean regions . . . a recent startling study in California suggested that a similar 10% of California was burnt each year before European settlement.</PARA>
<PARA>What they are saying is that there is not enough smoke in the atmosphere, and that is why the world is heating up. It is a very interesting hypothesis, I can assure you. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a recent paper from the Arizona Tree Ring Laboratory . . . it was revealed that the number of fires in Californian Sequoia has ranged between 5 to 25 per century for the last 200 years, i.e. a 4&mdash;24 year rotation. The greatest frequency was around the year 1300 AD. The most dramatic change occurred 200 years ago when the average temperature started to climb and the frequency of burning became the lowest ever.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is a correlation in these tree rings that shows that, as the burning decreased, the temperature increased. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also expected that there would have been extensive and regular burning in Boreal forests of Siberia, Alaska and Canada that would have been suppressed as settlement moved into those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tropical burning in SE Asia is routed in farming practices for thousands of years. There are reports that early European navigators had a difficult time navigating in SE Asia due to smoke haze. While burning in the forests and agricultural lands of SE Asia continues today, it is likely that there is much more contemporary effort to suppress the fires than occurred in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the decrease in biomass burning is causing environmental harm has been recognised by the US Forest Service who have instigated a policy of forest burning to return forest health to the US environment. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt that global warming has occurred as global burning has decreased in the last two hundred years. It would also appear that smoke and haze from rural sources has decreased dramatically over the last 200 years. While these developments may be unconnected, it is more likely that the decrease in smoke and haze would lead to more solar radiation reaching the earth's surface, so contributing to global warming.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a completely new hypothesis. We had the nuclear winter scenario some years ago. It was put forward by a CSIRO atmospheric research scientist, Dr Pittock, that if there were a nuclear war it would cool the earth quite dramatically and there would be a winter which would continue for many years. These scientists have suggested that the fact there is not enough smoke in the atmosphere at the present time is causing global warming. It is something that has been hotly disputed and will be disputed a lot more, I am quite sure, in the future. But it is something worth looking at&mdash;even though I certainly would be against forest burning, unless it were controlled burning in certain cases. I like the atmosphere as it is. It is nice and clear here in the Southern Hemisphere; we do not want it looking like the atmosphere in the Northern Hemisphere where there is continual smoke and haze. But it is quite an interesting point of view that they are putting across, and it is well worth looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could be looking at a huge scientific error&mdash;instead of clean air, we need dirty air. I am not a scientist, as I have said before, but I am a practical person and I can see that this argument could have some merit. I believe that the problems with the greenhouse effect, which I brought back to the House in 1987, still have not been solved. Also, a lot of the warnings that I gave at that time have not been assessed or even looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But from anecdotal evidence, we know for ourselves that there definitely has been a change in weather patterns over the short period of time of the last nine or 10 years. Something, it appears, is happening. We are getting more droughts and floods, and it appears as though the level of our seawater is increasing. With all of these things, nothing is definite. Once again, as I have said, this hypothesis that these two scientists have put forward is not certain but it is worth having a look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be quite interesting if they found, through computer modelling, that the atmosphere needed more smoke particles. What would we do? Would we start to burn off more land, increase the coal-fired power stations to create a bit more smog, put a bit more oil into petrol so that we can get more smoke out of our cars? They are the sorts of things we should be looking at. I believe it is worth while investing some money in an investigation of the matters they have raised. They have put forward a paper, and I believe it will be in the public arena very soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to rise today to speak to the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill, the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees&mdash;Imports) Bill and the Ozone Protection (Licence Fees&mdash;Manufacture) Bill. Ozone is an important issue and deserves the proper consideration of this House. It is my understanding, from talking to representatives of industry, that the industry in Australia supports the legislation, as does the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that some chemicals we use in society today, and have used in the past, for very useful purposes are now believed to destroy the ozone. Some of those chemicals are chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, halons, methyl chloroform, methyl bromide and carbon tetrachloride. All of these are chemicals which are important for us in modern life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ozone in the atmosphere, or in any place, can also be destroyed naturally, by occurrences such as volcanoes and solar flares. I understand that there is great controversy in the scientific community as to the degree of ozone depletion caused by a solar flare, or by a volcano&mdash;a very disruptive activity, naturally occurring, that pumps thousands of tonnes of chemicals and minerals into the atmosphere in a very forceful manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem all along in dealing with this issue has been that these chemicals&mdash;which scientific modelling shows are causing a hole in the ozone protective layer&mdash;we might want to get rid of are used for very useful things. They are used in products that we use in our everyday lives. Such common uses are in refrigerators, fire extinguishers, soil sterilisation, cleaning solvents, foam blowing agents, and aerosol carriers for inhalants for people who have asthma and other breathing conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) in his contribution yesterday afternoon said very forcefully that he wished us to stop now all production and import of all so-called ozone depleting chemicals. In other words, he wants us to quit manufacture and import of chemicals that we need to operate refrigerators. So, if your refrigerator breaks down or if you want to buy a new car, your refrigerator will not work, your new car will not be airconditioned and your house will not have air conditioning&mdash;regardless of where you live. The member for Dunkley believes that the government and the industry got it wrong through self-regulation and that we should simply tell all the chemical companies, `No more refrigerants, no more fire extinguishers, no more soil sterilisation, no more solvents for cleaning, and no more foam blowing agents in Australia.' That would make us unique in the world. I think the effect would be devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thank goodness the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mr Snowdon) did not listen to the member for Dunkley when he took his advice on this bill. We would be debating a very different issue today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is currently phasing out the manufacture and import of ozone depleting CFCs, methyl chloride and carbon tetrachloride by the end of 1995. This action has cost far less than originally predicted. I recall that there was a bit of doomsay in industry when this issue was first raised in the eighties, but I am pleased to say that, in a voluntary and cooperative manner, the industry has managed to get its own house in order and to find effective substitutes. These substitutes are not 100 per cent perfect. I do note that the hydrochlorofluorocarbons which replaced the chlorofluorocarbons still cause us some ozone depletion problem, but they are far less destructive than the CFCs that they have replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended in this bill to phase out those hydrocarbons as well, which means we will need new substances around the turn of the century and certainly all the way out to the year 2020 and the year 2030. We will ultimately totally phase out the production and use of these ozone-depleting substances. It is pleasing that industry has been able to do the work it has so far in a cooperative and self-regulating manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ozone Protection Act, which was passed by this parliament in 1989, draws its strength from the corporations power of the constitution. It is applied nationally, with the agreement of the states, to the national strategy for ozone protection. That is a very good thing. We on this side of the House approve of the use of that instrument in this case to make sure that we have a consistent practice across Australia. I can assure honourable members that the hole over Antarctica is not location dependent on what we do in New South Wales versus what we do in Victoria. We need to take consistent action across the country to deal with this serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that in 1985 a gradual decline in springtime ozone layers over Halley Bay, Antarctica, was reported and further extensive observations in 1987 found convincing links between rising stratosphere chloride levels, a reactive chemical&mdash;chlorine monoxide&mdash;and the ozone decrease. The Antarctic ozone hole has become a regular feature of each southern hemisphere spring. The stratosphere returns to normal at the end of spring when rising temperatures force a large parcel of ozone-depleted air to disperse, being replaced by ozone rich air from lower latitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that not all chlorine and bromide containing chemicals have the same effect on the ozone layer. They do have differing effects. Their differing capacities to destroy stratospheric ozone are indicated by numbers which scientists have developed called ozone depletion potential numbers. They allow rather more easy assessment of the benefits gained from reducing or substituting individual chemicals under the Montreal protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A local issue in my electorate that concerns me a bit is the phasing out of methyl bromide. Methyl bromide sterilises the soil. In my electorate, particularly in Gembrook, we still have a residual problem with PCN contamination of the soil. Methyl bromide is used in order to help clear that contamination so that we can grow cattle and potatoes. We need to do more research and development work in order to replace these chemicals which we now believe are destructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The natural greenhouse effect is also an issue of which we should take cognisance. In addition to the ozone problem, of which we are all aware and which we are all trying to take account of by dressing more appropriately in Australia, we also live with the knowledge that it is highly likely that we are pumping chemicals or compounds&mdash;gases&mdash;into the atmosphere which add to global warming and potentially to rising sea levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The natural greenhouse effect provides average surface temperatures across the earth of approximately 15 degrees Celsius. That is warmer than if there were no greenhouse gases at all. Human activity affects the nature and the composition of the earth's atmosphere. Our problem is that we do not know in absolute terms the effects that are caused. All we can do is try to model the atmosphere and the stratosphere and model our production of so-called greenhouse gases to determine, mathematically, the effects that are likely to take place. It is impossible to constantly measure concentrations in the upper atmosphere of various gases at various locations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know the effect on the earth's atmosphere of all these trace gases, but the ones that are most important in terms of discussing greenhouse effect appear to be carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons. I note that all of these are increasing. That has caused concern for people who are worried that rising earth temperatures may lead to devastating effects in some areas&mdash;for example, deserts may become more desertified. The areas which currently are marginal for agricultural production and/or human living may become marginalised. It is possible that rising temperatures, together with rising rainfall, may produce a better climate in some parts of the world and may increase agricultural production and make it more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know all of the effects of the so-called greenhouse effect and man's effect on those trace gases in the upper atmosphere. We do know that the climate models produced so far suggest a rise in temperature, from the 15 degrees Celsius average, of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 4.5 degrees Celsius ()in the earth's surface temperature over the next century. A possibility associated with that is a rise in sea level of up to 500 millimetres. While we do not know the absolute effects of global warming, we do know that some aspects could be positive but will shift economic activity from one location to another and that other effects could be negative and they could be absolutely devastating and wipe out whole animal, bird and plant populations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, unfortunately, is very high by world standards but represents only 1.5 per cent of the world's total production. In 1990, of all Australian carbon dioxide emissions produced, approximately 16 per cent were produced by transportation, 51 per cent by fossil fuel combustion and 31 per cent by forestry, which includes land clearing</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an absolute need to do further research on the greenhouse effect. While it is accepted in scientific circles that it is likely that our production of these gases is causing global warming, it is not universally accepted. Nor have the world's scientists agreed on the degree of potential rise or any potential problem or risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of proof, it certainly is important that we take action now to prevent any further increase in those trace gases in the upper atmosphere in case the scientists predicting doom and gloom are right so that we have taken action in advance to make sure that we do not create a problem for ourselves that we otherwise might have been able to negate. Obviously, things out there are changing all the time from natural effects. Not just man affects what happens in the atmosphere and stratosphere. Regardless of the controversy, we must do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I maintain that it is necessary for us in Australia to take a more active role in the development of renewable resource energy potential, which we have in great abundance. I compliment the government for its activities in renewables; but I would maintain that we need more emphasis, more money and more scientific effort directed towards using energy sources which renew themselves over and over again&mdash;which are, in effect, non-destructible&mdash;in lieu of burning coal, oil and gas. It is our huge production of electricity from both brown and black coal that causes us most of our problems in terms of greenhouse gas emissions per head of population in Australia. A large portion of that is dedicated to the production of aluminium in smelters which have very high electricity requirements. That electricity is uniformly generated by burning brown and black coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the alternative energy sources we might consider and further develop include micro-hydro. I note that in Australia we have used hydro-electric development well for the benefit of the country in terms of cost and stable electricity supply. It is unlikely that we will do more major hydro-electric development. It is highly likely that we will continue with the small stations that we are now putting in in a number of rivers and where dams were built some time ago in small locations to generate power from a megawatt to as little as a few kilowatts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various forms of solar energy&mdash;which is really the harnessing of the sun&mdash;range from direct sunshine to wave and wind energy, photovoltaic energy, solar thermal electric generation and biomass. In many areas of Australia there is real potential for greater use of solar powered fuel supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that needs attention is wave energy. Where winds blow across long clear stretches of water, such as the oceans, a constant wave system will build up and what we know as ocean swell becomes evident. There are a number of methods for harnessing wave power from the ocean swell and some of those are under development. Some of them involve floating a device. I note that a small demonstration plant considered to represent state-of-the-art technology in onshore wave energy conversion has recently been installed at Islay in the Inner Hebrides in the UK. The plant consists of a 100 kilowatt shoreline oscillating water column device which now feeds into the local power grid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Windmills, which harness wind power, have a long history of use for pumping water and turning grinding wheels for flour and other grain products. They are still used today in many countries, including Australia, for that same basic purposes of providing mechanical energy. Wind is solar power that has already been converted into mechanical power, so further conversion to electricity is simple and cost efficient. Around 2,500 megawatts of wind-electric capacity is connected to electricity grids worldwide. Most of that power is in California, where there are about 16,000 wind turbines with an installed capacity of about 1,600 megawatts supplying about three per cent of California's grid electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1994 Australia's largest and first commercial wind farm was opened at Esperance, on Western Australia's south coast. It was estimated that the farm, which cost $5.8 million, would recoup its cost in eight to 10 years, with savings in traditional fuel costs of $650,000 each year. The result for Esperance is the production of lower cost electricity. Wind power from the farm costs around 8c per kilowatt hour compared with about 10c per kilowatt hour for diesel power, based on fuel costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Photovoltaic electric power is one of the most important new methods of generating electricity currently under consideration in Australia. I have spoken several times in this place about the potential we have in the Kimberley for converting the tides into electric power, converting that electric power into hydrogen, which we might use as an energy carrier, then converting that back into electricity at the required location without any atmospheric pollution whatsoever. The result of burning hydrogen is the production of energy and water. All of these methods of replacing our coal fired generation must be urgently considered.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill 1995 because it goes to a vital issue that faces us all. It is one of those issues that goes to the core of what we are. Unfortunately, a lot of the people who speak on such issues in this place and in many other places deny the fact that we are a biological entity. That is why I wish to speak. I do not believe that this bill goes far enough, quite frankly&mdash;I do not believe it goes anywhere near far enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to some information about the ozone layer that the Parliamentary Library supplied. Ozone is created by the reaction of ultraviolet rays on oxygen molecules in the stratosphere. The ozone layer is a thin layer concentrated in the stratosphere at 15 to 50 kilometres above the earth's surface with the greatest concentration at 20 to 25 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stratosphere absorbs 90 per cent of the sun's UV rays. Absorption of these rays heats the stratosphere to temperatures much higher than those in the troposphere, which is important to the earth's climatic pattern. The amount of ozone in the stratosphere varies with latitude, night and day, seasons, and the balance between the rate it is being destroyed and created. The highest levels of ozone are located between 60 and 80 degrees latitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ozone depletion on a large scale was first observed in 1985 over Antarctica, peaking in 1993-94. Ozone depletion is expected to peak again around 2000 followed by improvements around 2050. Increased UV radiation leads to&mdash;I hope the children in the gallery hear this&mdash;increased skin cancer, genetic damage, suppression of the immune system, damage to fish and crab larvae, and the impediment of photosynthesis, and may affect forest productivity. </PARA>

But if you understand the beliefs of the Aboriginal people, and of most indigenous people in this world with religions that have not gone through a great deal of humanisation and civilisation, you will find that their relationship with this earth is a personal one. I agree with them. Therefore, if this earth is a living thing, biologically, it can die. Biologically, we can kill the things that it sustains. We can do it through our actions.

The reason why the commercial world and other people will not create the alternatives that we need for our lifestyle is economics: because the others are cheaper.

We cannot get involved in coastal management skills to stop these developers, because these people own the land and they are entitled to earn millions of dollars. It does not matter if all the fish stocks are wiped out. It does not matter if they turn around and do that. Then there are our farmers, and I am very much concerned about them.

The point is that many people do not understand the importance of the ozone layer to global earth. I was very interested to hear the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) chastising my colleague the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). The member for Dunkley has suggested that all of these refrigerants and other substances should be withdrawn from use because of the potential harm to our atmosphere. The member for La Trobe said, `How would the world get by without refrigerants? How would it get by without airconditioning in cars?' Personally, I think there are far more serious matters that need to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the beginning of the northern summer three years ago there was a major television advertising campaign advising people in Europe that their children should not venture outside in summer without UV 15+ blockout, without long trousers and without long sleeves on their shirts because of the potential for sunburn, because of the potential for skin cancer. What is the cumulative effect of continually degrading the ozone layer? I think it is important that all people understand that we do not know how quickly the ozone layer is capable of regenerating. What we do know is that it has been there for millions of years. What we do know is that, with the advent of these substances that we are using as refrigerants, as fire retardants, et cetera, the ozone layer, which is present in the stratosphere between 15 and 50 kilometres above the earth's surface, has become depleted extensively in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beauty of the ozone layer is that it is capable of absorbing ultraviolet radiation. Ultraviolet radiation is high energy radiation that is capable of ionising molecules. That is the very reason for the existence of the ozone layer or the ionosphere in the first place: that this radiation has enough energy to ionise molecules. It does that with molecules of oxygen which instead of existing in the normal O(2) form exist as O(3) molecules and that, of course, is ozone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if we remove that layer, it means that the ultraviolet radiation penetrates a greater distance into the earth's atmosphere and will eventually come in contact with living matter. That may be plant or animal or it may even be marine organisms. If it ionises the molecules of living tissue then we have the capacity to set up malformations such as cancer, variations in reproductive processes and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worldwide decrease of ozone in the atmosphere is now well documented with annual losses of between three and six per cent over the Northern Hemisphere in the last decade, and ozone losses in the past 10 years over Australia range from five per cent over Hobart to less than 0.5 per cent over Darwin. The most dramatic evidence of stratospheric ozone depletion is provided by the seasonal appearance of the Antarctic ozone hole where the total ozone concentration over the continent is reduced by up to 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who lives on the eastern seaboard of Australia is aware that currently we are experiencing abnormal weather, and have been for a couple of weeks. Statisticians, the people who collect weather data, have been stating over recent weeks that records are continually being broken. Those records include the driest July and the hottest winter's day. What is the cause of it? The answer is that no-one knows. But there is a chance that this has been caused by the depletion of our ozone layer. There is a chance that it has been caused by conditions that have probably emanated from the misuse of substances by humans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A member can come in here and say, `What a terrible thing if we have to look for new refrigerants or fire retardants.' But the point is, if we get past the point of no return with our ozone layer, if it is reduced to such an extent that it does not regenerate, then all the airconditioners in the world are not going to help us. Not even all the airconditioners that have not yet been manufactured are going to help us, because living tissue simply will not survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the Montreal protocol was all about. It realised that something had to be done and it tried to put an achievable timetable on the phasing out of these materials. I sincerely hope it is achievable. This legislation is there to ensure that we in Australia are going to play our part and that we are going to reduce the use of these ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not only going to reduce them; we are going to reduce the importation of them and the direct use of them. That is important, that we show our responsibility as a global citizen. We must look for new technology. We must look for new substances. Some have been discovered. We must ensure that the ozone layer regenerates and provides the safeguard that it has done for those millions of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The size of the hole in the ozone layer is currently about 23 million square kilometres and was first measured in 1985. It has moved further north since that time. We have experienced some of the side effects of ultraviolet radiation coming through but I can assure all people that with the passage of time the threat of skin cancers increases every year because, as the ozone layer is reduced, the exposure to ultraviolet radiation is increased. It is not only restricted to Australia and Antarctica; it has also been found in tropical regions, and the increase in ultraviolet radiation has been measured in Australia's far north at Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are fortunate that as a nation we have time to take the positive steps that this legislation is addressing. It is interesting that during 1986 Australia used 14,000 tonnes&mdash;14,633 to be exact&mdash;of chlorofluorocarbons, but by 1992 we had reduced that usage to only about one-third of that amount, just over 5,000 tonnes. So that is a measure of how we are addressing this problem. That is the relatively good news, but we must do more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for industry to understand the vital role it has to play if we are to manage the use of these materials successfully. Industry has to be responsible and show a willingness to look for new technology and new materials because there is going to be no comfort for them in expecting the old technology with its completely unsavoury substances to be allowed to continue; they simply will not. While there was an industry backlash feared in the 1980s following the Montreal agreement, industry now has generally accepted that it has no alternative to proceeding with new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many industries have adopted the new CFC replacement technology, including butane gases and hydrocarbons, for example, which are being used as refrigerants. In fact, they are being used at faster rates than is specified by the Montreal agreement. That says a lot for the environmental attitudes of Australian industry, and that is something that as a nation we should take pride in. However, as I indicated earlier, the timetable was completely arbitrary, and no-one knows the cumulative effect of the past use of these substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Ozone Protection Act was originally passed in 1989 many were surprised at the speed at which ozone reducing or replacing technologies were being accepted and utilised by industry but, by the end of 1995, Australia will have completely stopped the manufacture and importation of new chlorofluorocarbons, and that includes halon, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. The Montreal protocol has also proved to be effective, with current research showing that the implementation of the reduction plans has seen the slowing down of atmospheric growth rates in the troposphere of several major ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995 the Australia and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, endorsed policies for hydrochlorofluorocarbon controls. It was recognised that these materials may need to be used for an interim period. To implement the policies, the ANZECC proposed that the issue should be tackled on two fronts: control on hydrochlorofluorocarbon supply and production would be the responsibility of the Commonwealth government, and the states would control emissions and uses of existing HCFCs. These decisions were not arbitrary but followed two years of discussion among state and territory governments, business groups and the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill basically provides five main amendments. First, it provides that all current licences for CFCs, halon, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride cease on 31 December 1995. Second, it establishes a new system of essential use and used substances licences for ongoing uses allowed under the Montreal protocol. Third, it introduces a new system of control substances licence for hydrochlorofluorocarbons and methyl bromide. Fourth, it bans HBFC exportation and manufacture and, fifth, it will establish a trust fund into which all licence fees will be paid. The fund will support the administration of the act and management of the programs for HCFCs and methyl bromide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this is a very important issue. It should not be overlooked. It is one that the future of our planet depends on greatly, and there are many others like it. It is a responsible action. It is one that Australian industry has adopted, and I think it has surprised itself with the rate at which it is adopting it. It is one on which industry should be congratulated. It is also one on which, I believe, the government should be congratulated because it is a very positive response to a major problem. Insidious as it is and little understood as it is, this is something that we must conquer. Thank you very much. </PARA>

Certainly, medical science is battling, not only to spend enough money on, but also to come to grips with methods of controlling the epidemic of skin cancers, particularly amongst Caucasian Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ozone, in itself, is a substance which most people recognise as a poison. Strangely enough, it is one of those things in nature which actually works to our benefit. It works, as we all know, by reducing by some 90 per cent the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the earth. The destruction of that layer poses quite a few problems for our long-term survival on this planet. A number of speakers have already alluded to that particular aspect of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been debate about both the legitimacy of the greenhouse argument and also, in years gone by, the real likelihood of the destruction of the ozone layer by the industrial gases which are being produced. There is certainly ongoing debate about the legitimacy of the greenhouse equation, but there is no longer debate about the importance of the ozone layer. Ozone, chemically referred to as O(3), is a poison, but it is one of those good guys in the atmosphere and, as such, its importance cannot be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry and society have recognised that and have been prepared to move constructively and collectively towards ending, or I should say reducing&mdash;because, regretfully, ending it is not possible&mdash;the amount of CFCs and halons. The use of those chemicals which contain chlorine, which have been used in industrial refrigerants, aerosols and fire extinguishers in the past, has been rapidly reduced. Obviously, we are happy that in Australia the manufacture of those chemicals has gone down to zero. Australia is doing its bit as one of the major continents to reduce the overall amount of CFCs and halons in the atmosphere&mdash;the gases which are affecting the ozone balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard figures quoted which estimate that the amount of ozone destruction which has occurred has been in the order of 60 per cent in places. It is a horrendous figure and one that should frighten anybody since it indicates that a very fragile but important part of the environment could be destroyed by our actions. I will not attribute blame to anybody, but we have all used refrigerants, aerosols and fire extinguishers in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point is that collectively a decision was made to move very quickly towards the reduction of those gases. In some cases, I think people might have been pushed on a no-regrets basis but, after some 10 to 15 years of debate and action, I think everyone is more than happy that we took the decision that we did and very pleased with the results that we have had, particularly here in Australia, in addressing the requirements of the Montreal protocol of 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the efforts by Australia and other signatories to the Montreal protocol to protect the ozone layer are showing results. CSIRO projections based on these observations show that we are well on the way towards meeting the objectives of that protocol. It is great news for the environment and gives us all encouragement to further reduce ozone depletion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also give some acknowledgment to some of the processes which have occurred in Australia in meeting those targets. I mentioned&mdash;I think, very generously&mdash;that it was a community effort. Once the importance of the ozone was in the public arena and people realised that the destruction of that ozone layer was going to mean an increase in ultraviolet radiation with consequent health effects, people were galvanised into action. It was the consumer concern, I think, which promoted the rapid growth of the movement in industry and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience and of others at the time indicates that when knowledge within the community was expanded on this issue consumers very quickly stopped buying aerosols which were not ozone friendly. One only had to walk through a supermarket in those days to know which of the aerosols people were picking up and, when they did pick them up, they were having a darn good look to make sure that the one that they were picking up was consumer friendly. So it was the value of the consumer dollar, the spending dollar, which precipitated a lot of action from industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time we have to acknowledge that industry in other areas which were not so quickly affected also played its part. Hence new technologies such as new refrigerants and chemicals for fire extinguishers were very quickly sought and have now been put in place. So we have done a substantial amount to protect the threadbare shield of the ozone layer. Industry and community have certainly recognised the need to ensure that they play their part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation we are debating today also allows for the continued use and importation of some of these nasties, such as the CFCs and the halons. It is a limited importation, one has to admit, but in some cases it is regrettable that we have extended the time limit rate out to 2030. I think we could have been a little bit tighter on this aspect. After all, we have only got one ozone layer. While we might congratulate ourselves on what we have done thus far, it would be silly to pat ourselves on the back and give ourselves a slowed down timetable. I think it was the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) who pointed out in his contribution yesterday that the time frame could and should be tightened. I agree with that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill allows for the importation of some of the substances, obviously for medical reasons. No-one would argue with that. Certainly other industries got cracking when they were meeting the wrath of the consumer spending the dollar and they certainly came up with solutions quite quickly. I am sure those on the medical industry side, if the pressure were put on them, would also be able to come up with some of those solutions. Perhaps I am suggesting that, because of the emotive side of that argument, they are dragging their feet. Let us hope that they can get their feet going a little bit faster in the future to ensure that something is done about that. After all, as I said, it is an emotive side of it. While I am, fortunately, not one that has to rely on that particular type of medicine, I appreciate that there are quite a few asthmatics as members of the parliament, and certainly it would be a very unusual family in Australia that does not have an asthmatic in its midst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do support these bills. I appreciate some of the emotion which went into the debate, which I actually had to miss because of other commitments here this morning. Australia can be proud of what we have achieved thus far through consensus. The carrot has been a little bit sweeter or heavier than the stick, if you like, but nevertheless we are meeting the commitments we acceded to in 1987. I guess we cannot really expect to push industry past that but, with a little bit of prodding from consumers and from us here in the parliament, I think that we can actually see some of those targets not just reached but pushed further and further ahead so that that very precious layer, that very fragile layer that we all knew so very little about just over a decade ago, is now protected and can actually renew itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the figures from the CSIRO, the people supplying them do make warm noises about the ozone layer itself no longer depleting, but they base that just on one or two years. I think we still have to be vigilant. We have to keep up the pressure not just within Australia but without Australia on other countries to ensure that they too recognise the importance of this particular global issue and do follow it up in their own countries. Certainly the CSIRO does put out some warm words. Let us hope that they are right. After all, the very existence on the earth not just of people but of both fauna and flora will actually depend on our actions here today and for some time into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to rise in this debate in support of this package of three ozone protection bills. It is not the first time that I have had the opportunity to speak on the topic of ozone depletion and, like other speakers in the debate, I think that the pleasant situation that we find ourselves in at the moment, that we are having some success in tackling this problem, is very worthy of note.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) has just said, one of the main features of the tackling of this problem has been the wide community action that has occurred. It is a clear example of an environmental problem where, through education, discussion and debate of the problem, the community is able to come to judgments about the appropriate action that should be taken. They are able to join with government and they are able to join with industries involved in coming up with solutions that go towards the rectification of a problem which is caused by the actions of human beings and the way in which we have affected our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that this particular problem illustrates is that, within science, there is continuing debate about causes and effects. If I refer back to the original debate on the original bill in 1988, at that time there were still people in this House who had continuing concerns about the hypothesis that had been put forward about the absolute effect of the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. As time has gone on, science has become more sophisticated and has confirmed a lot of what was predicted at that time and has made differing judgments on some of the effects of the lowering of the levels of ozone in the stratosphere, but still has underlined that it is a problem of global importance, requiring action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing about this, as an environmental problem, is that through our local action we can have an effect at a global level. In fact, it is only by combining local actions that we are going to be able to tackle this problem. As has been emphasised throughout debates on matters to do with ozone depletion and to do with the greenhouse effect, these types of problems know no political administrative boundaries, and it is only through the concerted efforts of the sovereign nations at an international level&mdash;and, in the case of the Australian federation, through the combined efforts of governments at the state, local and federal levels&mdash;that we are going to be able to appropriately tackle these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things that we need to keep in mind are that, of course, through scientific investigation we can go to modifying what is the generally believed situation and the generally believed importance of the actions that we are taking. I wish to mention some research that was, I think, first talked about in an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> and was reported upon in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 27 July, under the headline `CFC substitute threatens wetlands'. I raise the matter of this article just to illustrate that our knowledge about this problem needs to be ongoing in the way that we modify what we think is important to tackle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work that was first mentioned in the scientific journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> indicated that some of those gases that had been used as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, such as hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, HCFCs, had been used as replacements for CFCs not only because they displayed similar properties but also because they had, as beneficial properties, shorter half-lives and therefore less potential ozone-depleting capacity. But the work that was quoted in the article indicated that one of the compounds that these substances degraded into was trifluoroacetate, TFA, which can be washed into the atmosphere through rain and has been shown to have an effect of toxic accumulation in wetlands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise that not to create a scare campaign but to illustrate the point that, when we talk about replacing some of the ozone depleting gases with other substances, we have to be vigilant to ensure that those other substances do not have further environmental ramifications. We need that ongoing research into the environmental effects of such substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) talk about the importance of modelling exercises in trying to be able to predict the effects of ozone depletion. It is only through sophisticated modelling that we can hazard a guess about what is going to be the effect not only now but into the middle of the next century. Clearly, one of the important things that we have to realise in tackling the problem of ozone depletion is that the actions that we are taking today are only going to have some effect five to 10 years down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply put, one of the problems is that the ozone depleting gases take considerable time to percolate the 20 to 50 kilometres up into the stratosphere where they have effect after they are broken down themselves, predominantly by the action of UV light. It is the chlorine and bromide radicals, amongst other things, that act as catalysts in the breakdown of ozone into constituent oxygen molecules. It is one of those clear examples of an environmental problem that can take some time to occur, or happen rapidly, but the solution for it can only happen over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us puts in place some of our obligations under the relevant international treaties. In fact, the pleasing thing about this is that the targets that we established back in the late 1980s we have been able to achieve even more easily than was predicted at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Richmond was saying, one of the reasons why that happened was through the pressure applied by consumers upon manufacturers. It was one of those things where proper product labelling had great effect in making people more aware of what was actually involved. It also had the effect of ensuring that industry continue to have pressure placed upon it to come up with solutions. It is a good example of the way in which the community can have a positive effect in tackling the problems that confront us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation widens the scope of the present legislation to include hydrochlorofluorocarbons as well as methyl bromide. As I said earlier, the so-called HCFCs have been used as substitutes for CFCs. We now will see caps placed on the levels of those gases that are in use which will, hopefully, place sufficient pressure on those who are researching and investigating substitute gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other substance, methyl bromide, is a substance which is used as a pest fumigant in soils. The banning of that substance in countries such as the United States and Holland has seen replacement fumigants put in use that appear to be doing the same job but without any economic consequences, as I read the literature. Again, I do not know how much work has been done on ensuring that the replacement chemicals do not have any different environmental consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a host of reasons, the way in which we have been able to tackle this problem of ozone depletion in the stratosphere is important. Throughout the debates that we have had on this question over the years, we have also gone to the way in which it is required under our federal system. A lot of the regulations that are involved in the manufacture of the substances require action at the state level. It is an example of where there was a need for a cooperative approach between the spheres of governments. It is an example, as has been emphasised, of where community action is important. It is also an example of where science is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a little disappointed that I was not able to actually hear the second part of the honourable member for Dunkley's speech today, wherein he put the interesting hypothesis&mdash;which had been put to him by a couple of scientists&mdash;that perhaps we need more smoke in the atmosphere. He briefly, outside the chamber, tried to bring me up to speed on this hypothesis; I will have to enter into a longer discussion with him to more clearly understand what has been put to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight it as an illustration of the continuing need for this type of debate and discussion within the scientific community. It did appear, during the scant briefing he was able to give me, that this was something that was well and truly coming from either far Left field or far Right field; I am not too sure which. I am not too sure whether it is coming from Left field or Right field; we just have to be careful about which direction it is coming from. Again, I emphasise that it is important to have these types of debates about what is really important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was speaking to somebody, before this debate, who had recently spent 12 months in Germany, in the Northern Hemisphere. I said that I was going to speak on ozone. He went on to say that it is a very important problem in Germany and they are really worried about the increase in ozone. I momentarily thought, `Wait a moment, what is going on here? How are we at cross-purposes?' But, of course, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, the increasing levels of ozone in the atmosphere are cause for concern. It is a phenomenon which is associated with the greenhouse effect, it is something that many people identify as being a problem, especially for those people with respiratory problems, and it is something with which the sciences continue to try to come to grips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 7 August this year, an article appeared under the headline `Heat on the US as Ozone Levels Rise'. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ozone levels in the United States are exceeding government standards so drastically that the American Lung Association is warning people with weak hearts and respiratory systems to seek shelter indoors.</PARA>
<PARA>So&mdash;given the way in which we, as a species on this planet, have been able to affect the environment&mdash;we continue to have to come to grips with modifying our behaviour to ensure that the various activities that we carry out on the planet are sustainable. On some occasions, we have to look at these types of hypotheses&mdash;such as the need for more smoke in the atmosphere&mdash;not with direct scepticism, and at least take them on their merits and let them stand up to rigorous debate and rigorous research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a worthwhile debate. The final point that I wish to make is that I am refreshed to see that, over the six to seven years that this particular problem has been debated in the House, there has been an increasingly bipartisan approach to the problem. I can remember that, back in 1988, the disappointing aspect was that there was political point scoring on an important issue like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the main, in the overwhelming majority of those matters that have a global dimension to do with the environment, we find that in the body politic in Australia there is agreement and an acknowledgment of the need for a concerted effort to tackle the problems. There may be, as a number of my colleagues have mentioned throughout the debate, some uneasiness that we are not proceeding at a rapid enough pace, and from time to time I share the disquiet that the members for Dunkley and Richmond mentioned in their contributions. But, if we take as the benchmarks the requirements that were put in place by such international agreements as the Montreal protocol and the like, Australia can hold its head high that we are tackling these problems at a rate quicker than is required at those international levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is perhaps disappointing that we have to spend as much time as we do in this place on the discussion of problems that are man-made. The only way that we are going to tackle them is by modifying our behaviour so that it has a lesser effect on the environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this cognate debate on a very important issue for Australians and for every nation around the world. The greenhouse effect has certainly become a major issue at national and international conferences around the world, and any moves being made by governments, as with the legislation before us, are to be welcomed. My comments today relate to my own electorate of McMillan in Victoria, where we have in the municipality of Latrobe the coal based power stations which generate virtually all of Victoria's coal based power. All those power stations are located within the electorate of McMillan. So there has been a very concentrated development over many years for the generating of electricity using brown coal, which has come, of course, to the attention of the environmental movement as an important issue in the discussion of greenhouse matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to bring to the attention of this House some things that have occurred in the last month and which I am sure that members of this parliament would be interested in and that those involved in the environment movement would welcome. We have seen the development in Victoria of a company, HRL Ltd Research and Technology. In fact, I attended on 10 August at the Hyatt Hotel the launch of this company, which has developed from what was a state instrumentality known as the Herman Research Laboratory, part of the old State Electricity Commission. With tax breaks of 150 per cent made available by this government just two years ago, processes were put in place to try and put together a research development. At five minutes to midnight on 30 June, just before the opportunity closed, the Victorian government and the federal government, along with some major backers, were able to put together what is known today as HRL Ltd Research and Technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major project in the development of that company is a $100 million research program into new brown coal power generation technology called IDGCC, or integrated drying gasification combined cycle process: quite a mouthful!<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this process, coal is gasified and the product is gas cooled to approximately 600 degrees centigrade before passing through a porous ceramic barrier to remove any particulates and then being fired in a gas turbine. Any alkali, sodium or potassium, in the coal is removed before the turbine stage because volatile sodium species will condense and form particulates before the gas enters the filter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following successful tests performed in the 25 kilogram per hour atmospheric coal gasification development unit at the University of Aachen, Germany, in early February 1991, a pressurised coal gasification development unit, CGDU, based on the high temperature winkler fluidised-bed concept was designed and constructed at the Herman Research Laboratory in Victoria. The CGDU is designed to gasify coal with air under pressure and is capable of handling up to 300 kilogram per hour of dried brown coal of up to 20 per cent moisture, wet basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unique technology promises to deliver a 25 per cent reduction in CO(2) emissions with the added bonus of an up to 30 per cent reduction in the cost of electricity. IDGCC will also be applicable to coals found throughout the Asian region. This has enormous implications for Australia and the world. For instance, China has very large deposits of brown coal similar to what we have in Victoria. This $100 million research project is going to play a major role in relation to greenhouse gas emissions in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the program, which has been financed by a syndicate of private investors, HRL will construct and operate a six to 10 megawatt scale coal gasification development facility at the Morwell site in my electorate and will undertake a three-year research program there. If that pilot plant is proven successful, a demonstration power station would be the next step prior to commercialisation. I think we have seen probably the last of the large power stations that have been developed to this point using brown coal. This technology will be the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is of particular importance when you consider that the brown coal deposits in many of the underdeveloped countries of the world are also going to come on-stream for electricity generation. Australia will have a very important role to play in developing this technology for future power stations. Only yesterday HRL put out a media release, which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HRL Limited today announced that it's subsidiary Herman Research Pty Ltd, had been given the go ahead from the Environment Protection Authority for a Coal Gasification Development Facility to be built in the Latrobe Valley.</PARA>

<PARA>I have just spoken about that. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The approval is a clear indicator of the potential value of the technology to the future of brown coal power generation in the Latrobe Valley, and we look forward to working with the EPA in monitoring the environmental performance of the Gasification Facility, said Mr Pleasance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We're confident that the technology will reduce CO2 emissions from new brown coal power stations by 25%, while producing electricity which is about 30% cheaper. If commercialised, IDGCC will make brown coal generated electricity cheaper than both black coal and gas", said Mr Pleasance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gasification test program is planned to begin early in 1996 with the completion of the research program by the end of 1997.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very pleasing to see the work that has been put into this over the last couple of years: first, at the Commonwealth level in offering incentive to industry to come forward and invest; secondly, by the state government in Victoria in putting together, at five minutes to midnight, the process&mdash;the last couple of days of getting it off the ground were quite hectic&mdash;and, thirdly, to have reached this stage now of clearance by the Environment Protection Authority to go ahead with this pilot plant. We are looking forward in the very near future to the turning of the sod and the actual building of that plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other items, of course, in the greenhouse debate which are extremely important in the shorter term in relation to what is going on in my electorate with the power stations. I think there would not be too many people who are not aware that they are being broken up into independent competitive units by the Kennett government in Victoria. There are commitments by industry, in conjunction with the federal and the state governments and the international community, to reach certain standards voluntarily within the processes that we have at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not letting any grass grow under our feet in relation to that. There is a group of people now&mdash;I am chairing a small group in my electorate&mdash;also looking at this greenhouse problem and putting together processes which we believe will assist industry, the new industries in particular, whether they are fully privatised, partly privatised or whatever they turn out to be in the future, to have all the information available on the emissions from those power stations at the moment and to do what is necessary in order to make sure that their emissions are not excessive in relation to what is expected of industry and what is expected of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the processes we presently looking at is the possibility of having the sink process&mdash;if you can find a biomass facility which will absorb CO(2) emissions in such a way that maintains our power stations in the technology that is being used at present at a particular level. That sort of work needs to be done and done immediately. Some of the other research work that is being done by HRL is moving towards more efficient use of the power stations, maximum use for the amount of coal that is being used and secondary uses also. Steam from those power stations is also a real possibility in the future to assist in the industry processes of reducing greenhouse effects and the overall effect on the ozone layer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pleasure for me today to be able to stand here and inform this House of a major project such as this, an overall project of $100 million in research, on a magnificent industry that is quite capable of being competitive in the future. It is not an industry that is now looking and saying, `Things will be right, Jack.' We believe this process will come to fruition. The scientists are very confident of the process and that future brown coal stations which will be built in Australia, and also in Asian countries, will be very efficient in their emissions and their responsibilities to the overall population of the world in how they operate and the effect they have on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me great pleasure to support the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The main amendments in this bill will change the existing unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The handling of cases will become simpler, more effective and less legalistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals reflect the outcome of discussions with employer representatives, the ACTU and state governments. The amendments have been widely welcomed by leading business groups, including the ACCI and the MTIA, and have the support of the union movement as part of the latest accord between the government and the ACTU.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes will make a good system even better. The bill will also make minor amendments to other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of fundamental minimum entitlements for Australian employees were introduced into the Industrial Relations Act by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>A key initiative was to ensure that employees are guaranteed a fair level of employment protection. This gives effect to the internationally recognised standards contained in the ILO's termination of employment convention. This step was necessary to address the removal or restriction of protection under the industrial relations agendas of conservative state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Act now ensures that employees have a remedy if they are unfairly dismissed. The legislation was not intended to supplant other fair remedies under state laws which met the international standard. Instead, it meant that an employee whose protection was inadequate, or who had no remedy at all, could use the federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation has been operating for over 16 months. It has been used by employees to differing degrees in all states and territories. It is the only relevant remedy for dismissed employees in Victoria, which removed any fair protection under the much criticised 1992 Kennett industrial legislation. It is worth noting that 45 per cent of all applications filed under the federal system have been from Victoria. There has also been increasing recourse to the federal system by dismissed employees in New South Wales, which does not cover all employees under its industrial legislation, and in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a new field for federal legislation, which previously only provided remedies where dismissals were discriminatory, leaving the general area of unfair dismissals to state laws. Clearly, by enacting the legislation, the Commonwealth has filled in gaps in employment protection: gaps which had previously existed or which were created by regressive state legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has carefully monitored the operation of the legislation, including by consultation with the National Labour Consultative Council and state industrial relations ministers. As a result of the consultative process, we now propose four changes to the existing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, all applications will commence in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Applications now begin in the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, which refers most of them to the commission for conciliation. This first procedural step can be streamlined, with greater emphasis on trying to resolve cases by conciliation first. The court will only become involved if conciliation fails and the parties do not wish to have the matter resolved by voluntary arbitration. The government expects that the great majority of cases will continue to be resolved by negotiation and conciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ninety-four per cent of all cases have been settled through conciliation or mediation, or have been discontinued after negotiation. Two-thirds of these were settled after the commission conciliated. Only six per cent of cases have been determined by the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the act will allow consent arbitration of unfair dismissal claims when the parties choose this option. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission will conduct the arbitration. The commission's decision will be binding and enforceable by the court. Parties will therefore be able to avoid the need for a hearing in the court by choosing a less legalistic way of resolving the claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment will clarify when state law provides an acceptable alternative to the federal remedy. The government has always intended that dismissed employees use state remedies rather than the federal provisions when the state remedies provide satisfactory protection against unfair dismissals. The existing test of what is an acceptable alternative remedy has two elements: the remedy must be provided under machinery which gives effect to the ILO convention; and the remedy must also be one which the court decides is adequate. This aspect of the legislation has operated more strictly than anticipated, so that only state laws which virtually replicate the federal legislation could be treated as adequate alternative remedies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most states have indicated that they are willing to provide protection against unfair dismissal which will meet the requirements of the ILO convention but which may involve a different approach from that taken under the federal laws. This has been accepted by the members of the National Labor Consultative Council as an acceptable approach. Accordingly, under these amendments, if the court is satisfied that an alternative remedy meets the relevant requirements of the ILO convention, no remedy will be available under the unlawful termination provisions of the Industrial Relations Act. It is of course implicit in this new provision that the state law must genuinely conform to the ILO convention if it is to be regarded as satisfying the requirements of that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amendment, a state will be able to give effect to the convention in its own way. Provision will also be made to give greater certainty to a state as to what will be taken to be an adequate alternative remedy. This is in response to requests by some states for such a provision. Accordingly, a state law will be taken to be an adequate alternative remedy where it requires the relevant state tribunal to give effect to the convention and gives it the necessary powers to do so. This does not prevent a state from choosing another suitable approach to meeting the requirements of the convention. Whichever approach is taken in the state law, it must also provide for the making of late applications by dismissed employees who mistakenly applied for a remedy in the federal system rather than under the relevant state law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth change is of particular importance. The act will be amended to make it clear that a breach of an employer's obligations will not automatically lead to a remedy. It has been suggested that remedies are given for breaches based only on procedural grounds without regard to the overall circumstances. Such a situation should not exist. For example, there should not be any guarantee of a remedy where the only defect in the employer's conduct has been some failure to provide procedural fairness and the employee's conduct warrants dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make it clear that this situation is not intended, the court will be required to consider all the circumstances in deciding whether a remedy of reinstatement or compensation should be granted and, if so, what the remedy should be. In other words, the court will weigh up all of the circumstances, and may, even though an employer has not met a statutory requirement, decide that a remedy should not be given to the employee. This approach is consistent with the long standing practice of industrial tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes two amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The first will clarify that no employee injured prior to the commencement of that act is entitled to have his or her compensation entitlements indexed after the age of 65. The second amendment will clarify that injuries sustained in the course of travel to or from work are not compensable if they occur wholly within the boundary of the property on which the employee's residence is located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also provide a mechanism for ensuring that determinations of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal are free of sex discrimination. This mechanism has already been provided in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Remuneration Tribunal. Stevedoring legislation will be amended by this bill to reflect current usage; `waterside workers' are now better described as `stevedoring employees'. There are also minor technical amendments about industrial relations jurisdiction in coal industry matters. All these amendments are explained in more detail in the explanatory memorandum that has been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the bill was introduced in the last sittings, it was not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. Since then, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has consulted employer groups and the ACTU about the best way to ensure that the new arrangements operate efficiently, effectively and quickly for all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission is proposing innovative methods to ensure the speedy listing and determination of applications under the amended provisions. To support this, the commission is constructing some new hearing rooms and support facilities for the parties and their representatives, in Sydney and Melbourne, at an estimated one-off cost of $1 million. There will also be some additional staff required to advise and assist applicants and other parties. The cost of the additional staff over a full year is estimated to be $0.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reduction in the resources required by the court is expected. However, it is not possible to estimate with any certainty what that reduction will be before the new arrangements are better established and the court has dealt with the balance of its caseload under the existing legislative arrangements. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will not oppose the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill, but I foreshadow that at the conclusion of my remarks I will be moving a second reading amendment to the following effect:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill and whilst recognising that this Bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, the House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose a very heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and that they were enacted without proper prior consultation".</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions in the current act, and now the amendments, have a long history which has been exemplified by a lack of consultation, by a complete disregard of industry opinion on these issues, by the Commonwealth government's overriding the states, by the refusal to countenance that there could be something wrong with the unfair dismissal provisions and, in a word, by the arrogance of this government which has both made these amendments necessary and so unconscionably delayed their introduction into the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating these amendments today not because the state systems which the federal provisions overrode were so iniquitous, or that there was some appalling social injustice that needed to be eradicated, but simply because in the run-up to the 1993 election the Labor government, desperate to garner support, responded and conceded to the ACTU and its demands and went on to ratify an international treaty&mdash;in this case, International Labour Organisation Convention 158 on the Termination of Employment. It did so over the objections of employer groups and most of the states and territories. One major employer organisation was only informed of the ratification after the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the things this government has done, I think history will record that some of its blackest days have been when it has overridden the provisions of the Australian constitution and acted unilaterally to give itself powers that had never been agreed to by the Australian people. One of the great things about the Australian constitution is that those who wrote it had the good sense to say that, if there are to be any formal amendments to the Australian constitution, they can only come into effect after a resolution by the Australian people through a referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, you cannot change the Australian constitution unless the people so agree. It is why, in the proper definition of the word, we are already a great republic&mdash;because power rests with the people. I know this is an aside, but I welcome the remarks of the Governor-General designate who made that very point: the great thing about the Australian political system is that power rests with the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years we have found that by entering into a treaty with some foreign power that process alone gives the federal parliament a power which is not already given to it under the Australian constitution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is amazing that he does not understand this point because you people have been abusing it for years. You can effectively change Australia's constitutional arrangements by signing a treaty with a foreign power, and that is exactly what you have done on this occasion with the unfair dismissals. Therefore, this ratification established a new head of power under the external affairs provisions of the constitution, which allowed the Labor government, using its numbers in the lower house and knowing that a federal election was just around the corner, to ram through its unfair dismissal provisions, which overrode the existing state systems. Not only did it do this; it also deliberately chose to interpret the convention upon which it relies in a way such as to place the onus of proof on the employer. It is noteworthy that the convention itself does not require this. It provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the burden of proving the existence of a valid reason shall rest on the employer; and/or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the competent bodies shall be empowered to reach a conclusion having regard to the evidence provided by the parties and according to the procedures provided for by law and practice.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor government did not take the latter option; it took the first option and placed the onus of proof on employers. This relates to a situation where people are dismissed by their employer. This existing set of provisions, now to be amended, basically gives people a right of appeal&mdash;a process of appeal&mdash;to the bodies established under federal law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What transpired is that, far from being the experts on constructing a sensible and reasonable system for people who do have genuine cases against their employers, the unfair dismissal provisions that the Labor Party introduced have been absolutely disastrous. In fact, it had to change them within months of first bringing them in. In the last 12 months or so the weight of evidence and the extent of the damage done by these unfair dismissals has become so overwhelming that even it had to acknowledge that something had to be done. They proved to be totally biased against employers. Honourable members do not have to accept my view of that. Justice Gray, in one of the very many court cases we have had on these provisions, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>South Australian&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Act and the present State Act, like their counterpart in New South Wales, operate in the realm of the "fair go all round" . . . This is not a realm that this Court inhabits. The provisions of division 3 of part VIA of the federal Act are not directed to achieving some balance between the interests of employers and employees in particular cases. They constitute a charter of rights for employees. They are directed towards the protection of the existing jobs of employees.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fair enough to protect, rightfully, the jobs of existing employees, but it is plainly wrong to completely disregard the interests of employers. For heaven's sake, as a matter of commonsense, the employers provide the jobs. We ought to have a system where the interests of both parties are taken into account. The system which was introduced by the Labor Party was basically written by the ACTU, as usual; it was dictated to the government by the ACTU. It totally disregarded the interests of employers. It was, as the judge said, just a charter of rights for existing employees and as a result proved to be absolutely and totally biased against employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions also impose very significant costs on employers and encourage frivolous or malicious claims. They contravene one of the so-called objectives of the government's Industrial Relations Act, which is to promote more harmonious relationships at work. One of the consequences of these unfair dismissal provisions is that they actually soured relationships at work. They eroded the jurisdiction of the states and, perhaps most importantly, deterred employers from giving people jobs. Even Martin Ferguson, the voice of the Labor Party in the ACTU&mdash;about to be a member of the House; the bloke who bulldozed his way through preselection in the seat of&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me get back to the point. Even Martin Ferguson eventually conceded that the outcome of some unfair dismissal cases had been indefensible. `Indefensible' was his word. That makes a complete joke of you, Minister, repeating that pathetic line of your own minister, who said, `The changes will make a good system even better.' What a pathetic thing to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions were a disaster from the start. Nearly a year after their introduction, nearly 10,000 claims for unfair dismissal have been lodged under the new provisions. They were so biased that an avalanche of claims were lodged. Small business people have basically been driven to the verge of bankruptcy. Businesses are refusing to take on employees because of the fear that they might then become the victims of bogus claims. People who have been sacked for sexual harassment have got back their jobs and have been compensated to boot. A good system, Minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you just one case involving this `good system'. A lecturer was charged with sexual harassment of his students. There was no dispute about the facts. This bloke was sexually harassing his own students on the basis that, if they provided him with sexual favours, they would get better marks. This lecturer was dismissed and lodged an application under the unfair dismissal provisions. Under your `good system', Minister, this bloke was reinstated and paid compensation even though the fact was that he, as a lecturer, was harassing his own students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You call that a good system, Minister! Gee, I would hate to see a bad system under you. That was a classic case. This bloke was harassing his own students. He was sacked, Minister, and he should have stayed sacked. A matter of absolute shame for you people is that such circumstances can even happen. We have had the government dragged with its ears laid back and eyes rolling to an acceptance that anything was wrong. Successive decisions such as that under the new provisions reveal even more bizarre outcomes. Industry bodies and the coalition pointed these out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know what the government's defence was for months? They said our criticisms were merely an example of us revealing our alleged anti-worker bias. That is what you said. This puerile formula is one of your standard smears. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, `John Howard hates workers.' That is what you said in response to our criticisms. It is a very interesting point to make because, as those criticisms of us were shown to be unfounded, it might give people an idea that the rest of the government's criticisms about our industrial relations policy are also unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government kept that up after not only a Federal Court judge made his criticisms but even Bob Carr, the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales and Premier of New South Wales, made the point on 13 April 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in the Federal law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are kids with good training, good education, who are not being given employment because employers won't take them on if they know that, down the track, whatever the circumstances, it is very difficult to effect a dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The European experience makes it very clear: if you make it complex for employers to vary their employment levels down the track, they won't take on employment to start with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth . . . I want to revise the Federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not Liberal Party political propaganda. This is the Premier of New South Wales, a Labor Premier, saying that this is not a good law that you are going to make better. He was making the very simple point that we have made for months: these provisions are an absolute disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the government was preparing the ground for an early election, finally on 21 June the Prime Minister forced his Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to make a humiliating reversal and to announce the amendments which are before us today. The reason why it was so humiliating was that not just months but weeks beforehand the minister, over there in Geneva at the ILO where the whole thing essentially originated with your approval of this foreign treaty, had been boasting to an international audience about how successful his proposals were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then capped off the announcement of the amendments with the statement we have had so fatuously repeated today by the assistant minister at the table that the amendments would make a good system better yet. It was fatuous because the previous system had been a disaster. It was fatuous because the federal Industrial Relations Court was then and still is making judgments under the old provisions and the damage is still being done. It is fatuous because the amendments which we have before the House simply do not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been so many examples that it is hard to know where to start. Let me give some of the more recent examples. This is your good system, Assistant Minister. A worker in a funeral parlour was dismissed for cremating the wrong body and was then awarded $8,000 compensation. That is great consolation for the family of the person who was mistakenly cremated. Even if a company has a clearly stated policy of dismissal for fighting at work, dismissal for fighting can still be deemed in certain circumstances to be harsh, unjust and unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a company that had a crackdown on people who were nicking stuff from work. One bloke was actually caught red-handed nicking stuff from work whilst the company had a campaign against pilfering. That guy was compensated and reinstated. In another case, the court found an employee's dismissal had been unfair, even though his employer had given him three written warnings about unsatisfactory performance. Three written warnings, and the bloke gets reinstated!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had other cases which show that the court limited the right of state governments to hire or fire employees. The court found that an application for a review of a judicial registrar's decision in an unfair dismissal case outside the 21 days permitted should be accepted because the court would be blind if it did not realise that the average person does not know of the technical requirements of order 74 rule 3&mdash;that is to say, the system is too technical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another case a manager was dismissed because of a $300,000 business deficit. He was reinstated because the deficit was not considered by the court to be conclusive evidence of a downturn in business&mdash;$300,000 in the red and that is not enough to prove a downturn in the business! He got reinstated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court found that a resignation given in the heat of the moment and subsequently regretted should not have been accepted by the employer as a bona fide resignation. So here we have an employee who is getting stuck into her manager. Obviously I do not want to repeat the words, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I will give you a flavour of it without going beyond the bounds of decency. The employee told her manager that she could stick her expletive job up her expletive. That person was found to have been unfairly dismissed and awarded $5,100 compensation, even though in using those words she had tendered her resignation. The court says, `It was all done in the heat of the moment. That is fair enough.' That person was reinstated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two employees who were made redundant were reinstated because the court determined that their employer had failed to consult adequately with them, even though the employer had discussed the cases with the relevant union.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond the anecdotal evidence, of which there is miles and miles, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Business Bulletin</EMPHASIS> small business survey published in July surveyed 400 companies with an average of 15 employees.

Even worse than that, employers have changed their whole attitude to employing staff as a result of these provisions and the damage, as a result, will go on. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in May, it was reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employer fears over the Federal Government's unlawful dismissal rules have been reinforced by a new survey which shows companies are already altering their recruitment strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Recruitment Solutions' survey of more than 600 employers of accounting staff found that 12 per cent of companies put on fewer permanent staff last year due to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many companies are worried about unfair dismissal actions being taken against them by sacked employees, and are increasingly using temporary and contract staff.</PARA>
<PARA>Whichever way you look at this thing, be it from anecdotal evidence&mdash;a lecturer who is caught harassing his students is reinstated and is paid compensation&mdash;or, more broadly, from the surveys, the fact is that a lot of people have been unable to obtain work as a result of the absolutely disastrous provisions of this particular aspect of the Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I have grave doubts about whether these latest amendments will bring the golden new world that the minister would have us believe in. Of course, the government claims that the new changes will fix the situation. But, given the government's lack of candour in the past about the operations of the unfair dismissal laws, who would be confident? Let's face it, the ACTU basically drafted the last lot. It would be amazing if it were not heavily involved in the drafting of the latest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide for procedural changes which will see unfair dismissal applications commence in the commission rather than in the court, and voluntary binding arbitration by the commission. The amendments require the court to consider all of the circumstances of an unfair dismissal case. These changes are so obvious, one wonders why it took a year for the government to institute them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the minister's remarks in his second reading speech where he said that procedural fairness will not be a more dominant influence in the consideration of the commission and/or the court in the decisions they bring down. I hope that is right but I must say that, from my understanding of the implications of the amendments, I am not confident that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until now decisions have been handed down in circumstances where it is more important to give people notice in writing of their alleged failures than it is to consider the issues on their merits. All we are saying is that you should have a system which is practical, that understands the reality of relationships at work and how things operate at work, and is not superseded by a technical reading of the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also purport to allow any state system to operate which provides an adequate alternative remedy which genuinely conforms with ILO 158 and preserves employee protection. But, as I have pointed out, the convention offers a choice of modes of compliance&mdash;for example, on the onus of proof issue. Therefore, the question of what will constitute a genuine adequate alternative remedy will quickly become crucial. These amendments are steps in the right direction but I do not think they go far enough. They certainly do not address the issues of onus of proof or legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal costs are very important because until now the average cost for an employer to defend himself or herself against one of these claims has been about $8,000. That is just an invitation to blackmail. An unscrupulous employee could say to themselves, `I'll lodge the application, then I'll say to the employer that they can fight me but if they fight me it will cost them eight grand so I'll take five grand as a compromise in advance.' That does not happen in every case but it is an open invitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have to wait to see the impact of these amendments on the system. I think there are some basic principles by which the government should operate. Certainly we will be operating by them. Firstly, the government must abide by its various international obligations. My point is that there are a number of options in doing so. Secondly, employees should have access to a process of appeal when they have been unjustly treated at work. We certainly abide by that principle, and will do so in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the system should be fair to both sides. It should be a fair go all round. It should not be stacked in favour of the employees, as it has been until now&mdash;nor should it be stacked in favour of employers in the future. It should be fair to both sides. That could only be reasonable. That is basically what we had before the government made these amendments and that is what we should have in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, any future system should minimise legal costs and legal niceties. It should not be a battle between lawyers when somebody gets sacked. It should be a situation where there is a fair, independent appraisal of the issues. Fifthly, we would like a system that discourages frivolous claims, and I am not convinced that is happening with the system we now have, even with these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, any system should operate within community standards. My view is that, if someone breaks the law&mdash;for example, is caught thieving at work&mdash;and it is a serious offence and they are convicted of that criminal offence in a Magistrate's Court, they should get sacked as a result. Quite frankly, I reckon an employer is entitled to sack them. It should not be the system that a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence in a black and white clear-cut case should then be able to go off and lodge an appeal for unfair dismissal. It is totally unreasonable and totally outside of community expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, there could be a case of sexual harassment&mdash;and I have referred to a particular case once or twice before. It was a clear case&mdash;the facts are not in dispute. If the person has abused their position&mdash;in that case as a lecturer&mdash;they should not be reinstated and paid compensation. The same should be said for the Qantas employee who used the Qantas passenger computer system to get the names of female passengers so he could ring them up and harass them at home. The employer brings the bloke in and says, `Look, this is outrageous' and gave him a warning. I thought they were very generous to him. Within a few months he was at it again&mdash;this time not into the passenger computer records but into the overtime records of the company. So they sacked him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under your system, Minister, which you consider to be a good system, this bloke was reinstated and paid compensation. I just cannot believe how you could defend that. There is hardly a person listening today who would not agree with us that that is in breach of community standards. You just cannot tolerate sexual harassment of such a blatant, nasty, unpleasant sort. So the sixth criterion is that any system you have has to abide by reasonable, mainstream Australian community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, you have to have a system that is user friendly and can deal with issues quickly and reasonably, not only where people have a fair go as employees but also where employers know that they have had fair treatment. The minister says much about the employer organisations all clapping him on the back for a great set of changes. Let me just add something of a slightly different tone to what he has said. I will read to the House what the main employer group, ACCI, have said on it. They have resolved, and it is dated 21 July 1995, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACCI notes the changes proposed by the Federal Government to the unfair dismissal legislation, and the degree to which these are consistent with some of ACCI's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these changes will constitute an improvement in the currently unacceptable legislative scheme, the fact remains that they are limited in nature and more requires to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, there are major deficiencies affecting the Federal jurisdiction in relation to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.onus of proof,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the lack of a filing fee and a filtering mechanism,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the inclusion in the Act of the ILO Recommendation,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.costs,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the provisions concerning absence on sickness,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the lack of power for the Commission to determine applications other than on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, uncertainty remains as to the future approach which will be taken by the Industrial Relations Court on the issue of procedural fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the changes which are now proposed are changes in the right direction, but do not go far enough.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACCI therefore calls on the Government to make further changes to address the issues identified above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACCI also calls on the Federal Government to now make the changes required to the Federal bargaining and agreement laws, which are too inflexible, and place too great a stress on the role of trade unions and the award system.</PARA>
<PARA>We will obviously await the final outcome and the impact of these changes. The next election is now not until March, so these will go through in the next little while. We will start to see the operation of the amendments in the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment I give on behalf of the coalition is that when we are in we will, as a matter of urgency, review the operations of these amendments and the act, particularly in respect of unfair dismissals. We will consult properly with interested parties, not just the employer groups. Obviously they are entitled to have a say, but we will certainly consult with the trade union movement and individual employees as well. We will consult widely. We will not just ride roughshod over people&mdash;as you have done with these amendments and, more generally, with your industrial relations&mdash;and we will introduce appropriate amendments in accordance with those basic principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has introduced a system by essentially abusing the external affairs power. The system it has introduced has been a complete disaster. It has cost a lot of people their jobs. A lot of young people have lost their jobs and the opportunity for jobs. As was said by Premier Bob Carr, Labor Premier of New South Wales, these amendments go some of the way towards the problem. The reason the government has introduced them is that it was thought there would be an election around the corner. They were preparing for it, so they pushed it. Under those circumstances, obviously we now await the impact of them. I move:</PARA>

We know what they are doing to Australian workers. We know where they stood in 1993 because we all still carry Fightback with us. We know exactly what they said they would do to Australian workers in 1993. Yet now they think they are going to give a soft, gentle line to Australian workers. </PARA>

They are trying to run away from the  second tranche but at least from the first tranche of legislation we know that is what they stand for. If anyone wants to see some pretty horrible legislation where there is no equality, where working people are treated as slaves, then they should have a look at the Western Australian legislation, have a look again at what the Liberals do to ordinary workers when they have the power in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister kept saying that there is no equality, that somehow employees have greater rights under our system than employers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an extraordinarily important part of the proper conduct of affairs in this place that, if it is a matter that has gone to a committee or if it is a matter that has gone to you, Mr Speaker, the matter be held in absolute confidence before it is in any way disclosed to a person outside. I remember, for example, that a little while ago we had a matter in which I think the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) was a chair of a committee and some suggestion was made that, because he had had a press conference refer to matters before a committee, that could well have been in breach of the privilege of this place. In the event, it was not decided it was so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that, if a matter is referred to you for consideration as a matter of privilege, it should be held absolutely confidentially at the stage that it is only a prima facie investigation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to draw a distinction between the prima facie inquiry which you make and the inquiry made by the Privileges Committee. To my mind it would have been far better if, in the circumstances, no person other than the member for Chisholm had been approached&mdash;and then only on a very limited basis. It does put you, as holder of the office of Speaker, in a difficult position if you cannot conduct some inquiries prior to making that prima facie report to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the balance of the events this morning, the concern that we all had was that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) seemed to be able to both prepare material and have a resolution typed before the House sat this morning. If that were so and if your report to this place was made only after the sitting of the House, then it seems that in some way the Leader of the House had been privy to the prima facie report you made. It is on that basis that I express my concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry of the Privileges Committee really needs to address, firstly, the extent to which in the conduct of your prima facie investigation any person at all should be consulted, other than the clerks who provide you with advice, and, secondly, the extent to which any prima facie report or, for that matter, any other matter which needs to be reported to the House should or can be discussed outside this place. Those are the two issues which I believe are important. I believe that, in order to ensure clarity and to establish future practice, it would be wise that the reference be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on that basis, rather than as a reflection in this instance on the events as you have described them, that I suggest that it would be preferable that the matter be sent to the Committee of Privileges which can investigate, report back and perhaps advise on proper procedures for the conduct of such prima facie investigation on any future occasion. </PARA>

The notion of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who was Leader of the House in a previous government for a substantial period, that he ever walked into the place after there was a Speaker's ruling on a matter of privilege or anything else without being forearmed with a series of appropriately typed up propositions would, of course, be a complete nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you might recall that I first raised this issue by way of a point of order this morning. The reason why I became particularly interested in the issue and why I support the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is that I was standing at this dispatch box this morning and I noticed that, on the other side of the table in front of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), there was a pile of papers which were clearly documents to be used for an ensuing speech&mdash;indeed, they were used for that speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make is this: they were documents to be used to support a motion which was already typed out&mdash;presumably in the office of the Leader of the House, but at least in a government office. They were the supporting documentation for that motion. Given that you, Mr Speaker, had not told the House of your response to the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this week, it was a little odd that the Leader of the House had already prepared a motion and had with him a great wad of quotes and speech notes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore perfectly clear&mdash;and this has been clearly revealed by your remarks this afternoon, Mr Speaker&mdash;that the government was not only aware of what you were going to tell the House, and presumably in terms pretty close to the precise terms, but aware through somebody in the form of the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo McLeay). Why would the Speaker think it appropriate to raise this matter and give the details of it to the Chief Government Whip? You could have given the details to the Prime Minister, but you did not give them to the Prime Minister. You did not think of giving them to the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House&mdash;you gave them to the Chief Government Whip. He is the backroom tacticianer of the Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, he is a factional hack&mdash;and pretty close to the worst kind. Mr Speaker, you gave the details to somebody whose role is obviously to help work out grubby tactics for parliamentary processes. The other thing the Privileges Committee might be interested in examining is not only why you chose the Chief Government Whip as the person you would communicate this information to but when you did it. When did you speak to the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and what did you tell him? When did you speak to the Chief Government Whip and what did you tell him? That raises a further question: are they the only two people you spoke to? Whom else did you speak to? Did you, for example, speak to any staff members? To what extent was this matter communicated around the government?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the simple point here is obvious and incontestable: the government was given foreknowledge of what you were going to say so it could prepare its tactics for this morning. You are the guardian of this institution. You have a very great responsibility to uphold the standards of this institution through the impartiality of your office. That is why this is such a serious matter and why the Privileges Committee should examine your behaviour and your actions and ensure that you behaved in a manner which was impartial and therefore upheld the dignity of the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives has been reduced to little more than a rabble by the Labor Party over recent years. </PARA>

I overlook the spurious points made by the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), in his paltry performance. I wish to bring out two statements from your report that make it very important that this do go to the Committee of Privileges. The first is this: you have said in your report, `I do not propose to be a judge in my own cause.' If the government has its way, there will be no judge in this cause. You have deliberately left the door open for there to be a judgment in relation to this matter and you have said you are not the appropriate person to do it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I want to raise another point from your statement which is very interesting and makes it absolutely essential that this issue go to the Privileges Committee. This statement does not answer one of the questions&mdash;in fact, the prime question. I do not know whether that is because the statement has been carefully drawn or whether the question just has not been considered. But what you have said in this statement is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the matter in question, I did talk to both the honourable member for Chisholm and the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo McLeay).</PARA>
<PARA>What you do not say is to whom you reported the outcome of those deliberations. That is exactly the point that the right honourable member for New England was going to. I repeat: you said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the matter in question, I did talk to both the honourable member for Chisholm and the Chief Government Whip . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It leaves open the question of what and to whom, after you had made that decision, you reported. That is exactly the thing that the Committee of Privileges could get to the bottom of. If the answer is nil, by reason of having that hearing, with both sides being represented, that could be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the third reason why it is absolutely essential that this go to the Committee of Privileges and that members on both sides of the House get to consider this is the very obvious question as to what interest the Chief Government Whip could possibly have in knowing of your deliberations&mdash;not the outcome of your deliberations. He has already said that he was informed of the outcome; you said a totally different thing. This is where you completely overstepped the mark; you did not realise what you were saying. The Speaker had actually said, `In considering the matter in question, I talked to both the honourable member. . . ' He did not say, `I reported the outcome to the Chief Government Whip.' You gave that information just now by your absolute foolishness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is this: what interest, and why, would the Chief Government Whip have in commenting on the deliberations? Being a person who was neither concerned in the complaint nor the subject of the complaint, of what assistance could he be to the Speaker?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the much bigger question again: is it now the case that any member of this House who raises a privileges matter must factor into their decision that the Speaker will consult `that' before he makes a decision&mdash;that he will consult the Chief Government Whip before he makes a decision?  If that is the outcome of this particular decision, obviously people will be much more guarded in what they put to the Speaker, and they will be much more guarded in what they tell. If it is to become a rule that the Chief Government Whip can be consulted on all deliberations, people will have to be much more careful in what they say to the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That comes back to the other point about privilege. Mr Speaker, my contention to you is that each member who raises a matter of privilege should have the confidence that they are dealing with you and you alone. They should have the confidence that what they say will not be reported to others on the other side of the House. If they are the subject matter of a complaint and they seek your guidance, in my opinion, they should have the confidence that they will not then be subject to having that guidance relayed to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in any event, the whole object of the motion is to determine that question. Is that not a question that should be looked at in the context of a privileges committee? Is not the answer to that question something that both sides of this House have an interest in knowing? Is that not a question which would be the subject of proper and formal deliberations by a privileges committee? Of course it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each side of this parliament has an interest in that question. It is something that you should be able to rise above and say that this House has an interest in. It is something that should properly be determined in the Privileges Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. The minister will be aware that foreign debt jumped today to $180 billion&mdash;the highest on record and an eight-fold increase on the debt of $23 billion that Australia owed overseas before Mr Keating got his hands on the Australian economy. Is it a fact that Australia's foreign debt puts a premium on interest rates paid by each and every Australian, including home buyers, as a result of your government's wanton mismanagement of this problem?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us correct your question. It is not the highest foreign debt on record, thanks very much. It is at least three percentage points of GDP lower than its highest point. Another thing that you might have also pointed out in your remarks is that the debt servicing ratio related to it as a percentage of GDP is down from something like 20 per cent in the late 1980s to about 11.2 per cent, and it in fact fell over the last quarter. You need to get those couple of points firmly fixed in your mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that today you decided to go out with a variant of this when you were quizzed on the doorstop, despite what the Treasurer had to say about these matters today. You attempted to portray the position as follows: `The worst net foreign debt position Australia has ever had.' Wrong, of course. You went on to say, `That is $10,000 for each man, woman and child. It represents in human terms, if you break it down for each person, $10,000 worth of debt for Australians.' Then the journalist said, `But they have not incurred the debt. They do not have to pay it back.' You said, `If you break it down, if you want to try to humanise the figures&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is his variant of humanising the  figures: to go around and frighten the life out of every man, woman and child in the country by telling them that they have $10,000 worth of debt. It is like me going to the member for the Northern Territory, who has just paid off his mortgage, pointing out that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has just taken on a $100,000 mortgage and saying, `We're going to average it. Whether or not you're responsible, you've got $50,000 each.' That is your variant of humanising it. It makes about as much sense as going around and doing that. This, of course, is a debt which is carried by the private sector by and large. From the government's point of view, about $7 billion worth of the $180 billion is carried by the Commonwealth government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can read the tables. It is $7 billion. So you are completely wrong in those propositions that you put forward. The only relevant measure as far as the Commonwealth government is concerned is what is carried effectively by the Commonwealth in its own operations&mdash;not by Commonwealth business enterprises or state enterprises, all of which carry it against their assets. So you are completely wrong. You cannot read your figures properly. What is actually carried in the course of the year and responsible to the taxpayer is $7 billion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and it relates to recent statements made by the Premier of Victoria with respect to Commonwealth-state relationships. Can the minister advise the House of the implications of these statements for Commonwealth funding of Australian schools?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="838" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I am aware of statements recently made by the Premier of Victoria in which he nominated education as the domain of the states. I might just remind the House as to what he has done with that domain since he has been in office. He has cut school funding by $400 million. He has closed 300 schools. And he has gotten rid of 8,000 teachers from the system. Some presiding over a domain!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is despite the fact that, in the period he has been in office, Commonwealth direct funding for schools in Victoria has gone up 1.5 per cent in real terms, yet he has cut expenditure by 10 per cent. We have funded him, through the index, to pay wage increases for teachers and he has not passed them on. Yet this is the domain that he claims Victoria should preside over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to see in another speech he made yesterday that he was claiming that Victoria was leading Australia. You cannot lead with a second-rate education system. You cannot pretend that what you are producing is dynamism in the economy if you are running the education system down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting that the Liberal Party in Victoria are very concerned about this state of affairs. Ms Penson, who is the Liberal candidate for Jagajaga, in a letter that she sent to would-be constituents of hers, said that Victoria's literacy and truancy problems `are more than a little disturbing'&mdash;something of an understatement, I would add&mdash;but she goes on to say that a federal Liberal government will offer a national strategy to raise the standards of literacy and numeracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not what the Liberal Party nationally would do. It is not what John Howard is saying, because in his headland speech he said he will give more freedom to the states&mdash;more freedom with the funds, more freedom to cut the services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, if literacy is such a problem, why is it that the Victorian government is refusing to participate in the national survey of literacy standards?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government is seriously concerned about what is happening to education in Victoria. It is against that background that I have indicated recently a preparedness to withhold growth funds next year from Victoria unless they commit to two important things: firstly, that they agree to outcome measures, so that we can really work out whether or not improvements in the education system are occurring with less funds; and, secondly, that they commit to the national survey of literacy. They cannot masquerade around the country saying literacy is a problem, it needs a national response, but not be prepared to participate in the exercise. These issues are of national importance. They are so essential that we are not prepared to leave it to Victoria alone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance. Will the Deputy Prime Minister condemn the line of argument adopted by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who attacked counsel assisting the Marks royal commission on the basis that she was related by marriage to the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Amanda Vanstone?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me say that obviously I absolutely accept the right of any spouse of a member of parliament to hold any position of authority within the Commonwealth, the state sector or anywhere you care to name. It is most important that that should be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question arises in any particular set of circumstances as to whether or not the particular position happens to be appropriate in the context of the issue that you are dealing with. Senator Evans did not challenge the right of Ms Vanstone to be a judge, to be a QC or to be whatever the legal profession entitles her to be&mdash;and that is entirely appropriate. The question is whether or not it is appropriate that a person in that position serve in a particular context. There is a legion of judges, lawyers or whatever who are excluding themselves from court processes every year because some element of it might in some way or another relate to the possibility of the appearance&mdash;not the actuality of it; the appearance&mdash;of compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Counsel assisting a royal commission is not a permanent position. It is not a job that you hold for life. It is a job that is there for temporary purposes, and many people can fill that position. There are numerous barristers available around the Commonwealth, including Western Australia, who could serve in that position. The question which arises is whether or not in that highly charged situation, in a highly politicised royal commission, as this one is, no matter what level of integrity the person concerned may have&mdash;it may, to all intents and purposes, be very high indeed&mdash;it is appropriate that a person who has a relationship with somebody actively engaged in the political process ought to serve. That is what Senator Evans called into question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that was just one of a number of factors that any person placed in that sort of situation would want to consider. She has a sister-in-law, here in this place and outside in the community, virulently advocating various positions in relation to the conduct, the existence and the creation of the royal commission&mdash;and she chooses to serve in it. That does not go to any criticism of the way in which she may have conducted herself in the course of the royal commission. It is a question of appearances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought a most dignified statement on those matters was made this morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A.M.</EMPHASIS> program by David Smith, whose refusal&mdash;his absolute determination to stand by parliamentary privilege and cabinet confidentiality as central features of decent democratic institutions in this country&mdash;has now been reported to the state Attorney-General for action against him. He was queried about these matters. He is obviously a person most directly concerned with the progress of the royal commission and most directly reliant upon fair treatment in the case of his own person. He was asked what he, as a person directly affected by it, had to say about it. He did not call into question the integrity, dignity or whatever of Ms Vanstone.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about David Smith. What he said in the circumstances in which he finds himself&mdash;a person directly, personally affected by the political processes associated with the royal commission, and now by its legal processes&mdash;is that he does not have confidence in the appearance of the situation, in which a person who is related to clear political opponents is there as the counsel who, in technical terms, is trying to put him in gaol.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is in that context that I think questions can be legitimately raised&mdash;not in connection with the integrity of Ms Vanstone at all, but in connection with the politics and the appearance of fairness in this process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to inform the House that planning for the western Sydney orbital road&mdash;the road that will link Sydney's two airports as well as linking the highways to the south and north of Sydney&mdash;is now well advanced. In this year's budget, the government announced some $260 million by way of a package to upgrade the road approaches to Sydney West airport and to announce the commencement of an EIS on the southern section of the orbital road from Prestons to Cecil Park. That is the section that will link the two airports. As such, I am able to inform the House that its completion is timed to coincide with the airport's opening in 1999.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to announce that this freeway will be extended all the way to link with the M4 at Eastern Creek at an additional cost of some $220 million. Planning for this second stage will be funded in next year's budget with major works commencing in 1998. The completed orbital will bring great benefits to the whole of Australia, to western Sydney most of all. Indeed, a draft study on the project just provided to the government estimates the national dividend in terms of reduced transport costs at $870 million and the economic windfall to the nation at some $1.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it was with such benefits in mind that, in announcing the project last year, I suggested it might have to be funded by the private sector. Given its high priority and given its large cost, it was only right that all of the options of funding were explored and that the public was forewarned that a toll might be the price of bringing forward this vital new investment. Today I can inform the House that, after analysing the draft study, we have decided there will be no toll on either section of the western orbital.</PARA>

As such, today I can confirm to the House that the second section will proceed and will be built without a toll, a decision that I know will be warmly welcomed by those on this side of the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have been most surprised if Senator Evans's objections&mdash;indeed, mine, as I expressed in answer to the previous questioner&mdash;applied exclusively in the case of it being a `Ms' Vanstone we are dealing with rather than a `Mr'. The point has nothing to do with the gender of Ms Vanstone. It has everything to do with the familial relationship. That is all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the point you make about the opposition not objecting to the relationship between the two, but of course it would be incumbent upon the High Court judge, if in any set of circumstances he thought there was an element of that relationship which impinged on his capacity to consider a particular case, to exclude himself from it. Likewise, it would apply to judges&mdash;many of them are married to solicitors and barristers&mdash;who, from time to time, have personal relationships or a friendship or association with a person whose case could conceivably be impinged upon by a case that is before that judge, or the particular lawyer, barrister or solicitor. They exclude themselves. It is not an unusual thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments I made about the position of Ms Vanstone do not go to her appropriateness to be a QC, to be a barrister or to serve as a judge. They go to the question of a highly politically charged royal commission in which various members of parliament, seeking to uphold the rights of parliament and uphold the rights of cabinet confidentiality, are now being referred to the Attorney-General in Western Australia for prosecution. It is a most intense political atmosphere. The individual directly concerned&mdash;who may go to gaol for it, of course, if taken through to a charge of contempt&mdash;says that he feels uncomfortable with a situation in which there is a person related to another individual who is a spear carrier for the Liberal Party in the Senate, in the case of Senator Vanstone.</PARA>

Can the minister advise the House what action is being taken by the Department of Social Security to make sure that only people who genuinely qualify for social security payments are able to be paid?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and for the opportunity to acquaint the House with the latest statistics on the department's compliance activity for the 1994-95 year. It is well known amongst those who know about these things that since the mid-1980s the government has undertaken a very wide range of activities to tighten our social security system and to restore the integrity of a system which, according to an international expert from Harvard University, Professor Weatherley, was at that time&mdash;in the mid-1980s&mdash;pretty lax in ensuring that payments went only to those who were entitled to receive them. His conclusion as of 1993 was that the integrity of the system had been, as a result of government actions, essentially repaired.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, what we do by way of compliance is now recognised as being of world leading standard in many respects. For example, I have just returned from the United States. In the course of that visit, I spoke to AT&amp;T and visited their headquarters. They provide us with the parallel high capacity computing facilities we use in data matching. They told me that our operation here in the Department of Social Security is their world reference site&mdash;not only in terms of its technical aspects but also in terms of the legislative framework and the methods we have used to deal with the privacy aspects and so forth. It is a very good operation and is recognised as such by those who have expertise in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data matching is now a significant source of savings to the government. It saves us around $5.4 million per fortnight. This is around $140 million per year. If the opposition were serious about achieving a tightening of fiscal policy, you would think they would support that. Have they been supportive? No. We get this constant carping. We do not get clear commitments from them to maintain the operation of this program, which needs to be legislatively renewed at the end of this year. What do we get from them? Uncertainty, inaccurate criticism and ill-informed criticism. This is how they approach the need to ensure the integrity of government programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data matching is a significant part of what we do, but it is only a component of our compliance activities. Overall, we have 93 mobile review teams that visit various areas and do intensive reviews of what is going on. We have computerised processes at the point of application to ensure that people do not have multiple identities and other such things. We regularly review people on various payments to ensure that their circumstances are as they claimed. People who are getting unemployment payments, of course, are required to meet pretty stringent requirements. They have to show that they are available for work, that they are actively seeking work and that they are actively taking steps to improve their availability for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of these activities is very substantial. In the 1994-95 year, the department did 2.1 million reviews, and much of that was generated by data matching. As a result of that, there were 127,000 cancellations and 60,000 reductions. Also, I might say that some 29,000 people had their payments increased. So it is not purely a one-way street here. What we are on about is not cutting people's benefits but ensuring that people receive their correct benefits. On the one hand, we do not want them to rort the system but, on the other hand, we do not want them to get less than they are entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great success and is recognised as such. It is an area where we are increasingly getting into the business of consulting with others throughout the world because of the recognised nature of our expertise in this area.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a series of problems now in the way in which this royal commission has been presented, which makes it even more important that the position of propriety appears to be done as opposed to simply being done. That goes to the way in which witnesses have been called, as David Smith said. For example, we have yet to hear from the people who drafted the petition. It is now two months into the royal commission. One would have thought that a few facts would have been established to start off with&mdash;so much so that Mr Halden, one of the principal persons, has finally had to go and present his evidence to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. To get a hearing for his evidence, he has to put it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a read of that evidence casts an awful lot of things in a very different light. He has not been able to get himself on to be heard. We have heard all this nonsense about, `They will be called.' Don't you know that at a royal commission you don't get one shot at witnesses. You can come in persistently through the period of a royal commission. You can be recalled. They can have you on day one, on day 20 and on day 55 if they want. So it would have been entirely possible&mdash;and appropriate, I would say&mdash;for them to have had first up the people who put in place the petition. It has not actually been factually established before the commission that there was a petition, because no-one who has been associated with it has actually gone in and said there was&mdash;and we are now into about the second month of the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a problem for people who look at the processes of this royal commission, and the problem goes, of course, to the original political origins of it, rightly described by Laurie Oakes this morning as outrageous. Yesterday Gerard Henderson pointed out with absolute clarity that this is the sort of commission that Malcolm Fraser rejected outright when he was invited to go down this particular course. He had a bit of a sense of propriety around the place, before the Liberal Party descended. So the question that comes in this highly politically charged atmosphere is: what do you do to have a decent regime of political propriety associated with it in so far as you can go? I think that David Smith's questioning of that, and I think Senator Evans's questioning of that, is entirely appropriate.</PARA>

This year we will also start work on the treacherous lake section of the highway, that is, the section between Old Northam Road and Linley Valley, with a $4.2 million allocation for widening and reconstruction works in that location. On top of that, the federal government has allocated another $10 million to new works on the Western Australian national highway, works which will involve duplications, bridge construction and planning studies, all of which will result in greatly improved road conditions. That is almost $21 million worth of new road projects in Western Australia under this program. You can add to that $166 million over the next three years from the Commonwealth for maintenance and for major rehabilitation works on Western Australia's national highway network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year Western Australia will receive $67 million. That is the second highest allocation ever given to the state under the national highway program. In fact, it was exceeded in only one year, and that was the result of a huge top-up from the One Nation program funding. That aside, this is the highest allocation ever. On top of that, we are handing over another $97.8 million in untied road funds this year alone to provide aid to Western Australia's state roads and local roads. I hope Mr Charlton and the Western Australian government now find the time to properly consider how to spend that allocation and to get on and build the works with great efficiency.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The national training reforms are being addressed on behalf of all state, territory and Commonwealth governments by the Australian National Training Authority, which has a board of directors from industry. Therefore, the government welcomes business bodies such as CEDA using their resources to see how the national training reforms are working and offering constructive views on improving them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CEDA is overwhelmingly supportive of the directions of the reforms. In a report arising from its review, CEDA has praised the government for developing national competency standards across a wide range of industries, creating accredited training in areas which previously had none, successfully implementing more than 100 AVTS pilots, developing a national core curriculum for schools, improving links between schools, TAFE and industry, gaining acceptance of the national training wage and developing innovative regional arrangements between schools, industries and training institutes aimed at meeting local needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report of CEDA's is based on seminars which began in March of last year. Of course, much more has been achieved in the 18 months since then. Many of the improvements which the CEDA report suggests have already been implemented. For example, state and Commonwealth ministers have already agreed to actions which will increase industry's involvement in training by simplifying structures, streamlining arrangements and reducing red tape. This means that industry will have more say in the training system and best practice bodies within an industry will be able to endorse competency standards directly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accreditation arrangements for courses are also being streamlined to speed up approvals. For instance, the creation of the Standards and Curriculum Council has simplified national training structures. Industry will be better served through improved coordination of standards, curriculum and assessment through the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All governments in Australia have agreed that industry's training needs will be met more effectively through a more diverse and open training market, and a choice of training providers is being introduced progressively around the country. Training reform is already producing significant dividends for employers and, more importantly, for our young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still more to do.

There is reference in that article to the Australian National Line and to the autobiography of a great Australian, Sir John Williams, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">So ends this day</EMPHASIS>. In that comment Sir John referred to my own direction to him. I want to quote Spiers's point. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir John named Ian Sinclair as the later coalition transport minister who informed him that instead of putting commercial considerations first, ANL was to become an instrument of government policy.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, I told Sir John that it was important he put, as I said at the time, the commercial considerations of ANL first and not his own. At that stage he ran Fleetways and together with his son had a monopoly of land transport to ANL. I told him then, as I publicly said after his autobiography was published, that it was inappropriate for him as chairman, although he was a very good chief executive of ANL, to have a conflict of interest between having a monopoly of land transport services to ANL's base in various ports around Australia and, at the same time, being chairman of a major national operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a few moments ago in the House during question time the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) defended the waterfront reform process undertaken by his government, using statistics that came from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report into the waterfront performance of Australia that was concluded at the end of 1993. It was a very interesting comparison for the minister to use. Do you know that the latest report by the BTCE, which was presented in December last year, has yet to be made public? That document has been going backwards and forwards between the BTCE and the minister's office, with the minister's request that it be rewritten. It has been rewritten several times. It has been sitting on your desk now for the last four months. Why don't you release that document so that we can see what the BTCE had to say about waterfront reform in Australia as of that time?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give you a reason why the minister has been trying to keep that one under wraps. It goes in the report done by the Bureau of Industry Economics which has yet to be released publicly. It was supposed to be released last week, yet this government decided not to release it but to hide it. We have a copy of it here. I will give you an insight into why the minister chose to use out-of-date figures. It is in the BIE report into Australia's waterfront performance. Page 18 of the executive summary says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent declines in container stevedoring productivity has resulted in Australia falling well behind similarly sized overseas ports.</PARA>
<PARA>If you go to page 24 of the BIE report, which has not been made public but should have been made public by now, you will see that it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, rather than witnessing progress in waterfront productivity, the past year has seen some serious setbacks in crane rates.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall five port average fell between September 1993 and December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 18 of the BIE report refers to the national transport planning task force document that was concluded at the end of last year. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Users and operators also noted recent significant declines in workplace performance and questioned whether present levels of competition were sufficient to maintain the pressure for continuing improvement.</PARA>
<PARA>All of those statements in the BIE report, which is yet to be tabled, prove the reason why this government is choosing to use out-of-date figures to support its claim, which it repeats continually, that waterfront reform in Australia under this government has been a huge success. If you listened to the anecdotes of the people who use the waterfront you will know, as do I and the people who wrote the international benchmarking waterfront 1995 report in the Bureau of Industry Economics, that waterfront reform in Australia has not been the success that this government has been crowing it is. For example, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to container productivity, most overseas ports have moved ahead while Australia has stepped backwards.</PARA>
<PARA>Hardly what you would call an endorsement of waterfront reform under this government. It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Waterfront charges for containers in Australia are considerably higher than most of the surveyed ports in New Zealand, Asia and Europe.</PARA>
<PARA>It also goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crane rates at the best performing container terminals is equivalent to some of the poorest performances in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA>On the same page it also goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it generally takes 50 to 100% longer to unload and load a container ship in Australia as it does in a comparable overseas port.</PARA>
<PARA>On the next page it goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the lowest charges in Australia are equivalent to the more expensive ports on the West Coast of North America.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what the latest review of Australia's waterfront performance has to say about the government's waterfront reform program. This analysis has not been done by me or by the Minister for Transport; it has been done by the government's own body&mdash;a disinterested party, you might say&mdash;that has expert analysis available to it to provide us with an expert judgment as to the performance of the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any reasonable person who read this BIE document, any person who read and heard the concerns that are coming from people using the Australian waterfront, will not agree with the statement that this minister has been repeating over and over again. The best way to summarise what he has been saying is to read a press release he put out on 18 August this year, only a couple of weeks ago, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The waterfront reform program has been a huge success.</PARA>
<PARA>Anybody reading the BIE report, anybody speaking to people who are users of our Australian waterfront, will say that it has not been a great success. Our Australian waterfront does not perform as well as it ought to. Our Australian waterfront in recent times has been going backwards. Our Australian waterfront does not make Australia competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Australian waterfront has seen an enormous amount of money&mdash;$440 million of Australians' money&mdash;being poured down the throat of the Maritime Union of Australia, those wharfies who took their redundancy package during the waterfront reform process. We are not talking about tens of thousands of wharfies; we are talking about 4,000-odd wharfies who took a redundancy package topped up as a result of this government's agreement&mdash;$440 million worth of redundancies to top off these people's retirement packages; yet we continue to get, coming from this government, a crowing of what they have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the House today, and I am sure many people will agree with me, that the way this government has been portraying its success in waterfront reform in this country has been a misrepresentation of the truth and that it has not been the case. The truth of it is that we have wasted an enormous amount of money. Indeed, you might say that the waterfront reform program under this government has been a giant con, because the people who have benefited have been the wharfies who picked up the $440 million, those retiring wharfies, not the people of Australia who paid that money out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case you are thinking of it, do not feel at all sorry for those wharfies who did not pick up their retirement package&mdash;this generous redundancy that the government endorsed and which you and I, as taxpayers, have paid for&mdash;because those people who remain on the waterfront have plenty of good reasons for staying there. Their Labor mates in government here in Canberra made sure that not only were those retiring people going to get a lot of money but also there would be enough room at the trough for those who remained on the waterfront to get their noses in too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the time waterfront reform started to the time it concluded and up to today, the wage of a waterside worker has virtually doubled. When waterfront reform started, according to Conaust, a grade 4 wharfie, an average wharfie, was earning $34,000 a year. As at the beginning of this year, the same grade of wharfie was earning $75,000 a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From $34,000 before this government allegedly reformed the waterfront to $75,000 today. So do not feel sorry for the people who remain. Do not say, `Isn't it a pity they missed out on the big $100,000 redundancy package.' The people who stayed got a good deal too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not think that those wharfies who made the supreme sacrifice and offered to retire and take the redundancy package have been left out of the whole business. Many of them are back on the waterfront today, working as casuals. What a very nice repatriation program this government has for its Labor mates who have to make a small sacrifice for the national cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can see that an enormous amount of money has been paid out, whether it be to retiring wharfies or to those who continue to be employed on the waterfront. But if you look at the BIE paper, which this government will not release, you can see that we have not got any value out of that money at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all of the money and all of the you-beaut, one-off rorted deals that this government has given the waterside workers and their now amalgamated union, the Maritime Union of Australia, you would think that the MUA would think that the government was pretty good and would be doing the right thing by it. But even at this very moment we are in the process of putting through a bill that will pay $19 million worth of seafarers' PAYE tax bills for them&mdash;a $19 million grant to pay for the seafarers' PAYE tax bill! You do not see Qantas employees getting their taxes paid by the government through a grant, yet the MUA and their members get that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been an absolutely ripper deal that this government has given those people in the MUA. But even now they are talking about going on strike. That deal of $19 million was to pay for the arrangements agreed to to settle the last strike just on 12 months ago. Now we are shaping up for another strike because the MUA does not like the colour of P&amp;O's money. But you can rest assured, as you heard today from the minister, that the minister's old mate Neville Wran does like the colour of the government's money. And a couple of his other mates do too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull were put on the board of ANL. In order to put them there the entire board of ANL had to be sacked without explanation&mdash;no notice, bang, just gone&mdash;with Neville Wran, Malcolm Turnbull and so on installed. Mates of the minister. You might think that would be justifiable if these so-called mates had any experience of running a shipping company. But did they have any experience of running a shipping company? No, they did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dare say the only training that these people had was careering around Pittwater on the minister's own yacht. You can just picture it now. There is Lawrie and Malcolm and Neville, up on the deck of the minister's yacht&mdash;</PARA>

There is the Minister for Transport and his mates, Neville and Malcolm, up on the deck of the minister's yacht, with a glass of French bubbly in one hand, doing the patriotic thing, letting the Grange breathe before drinking it. You can just picture them there, with Lawrie saying, `Look, boys, you don't need to know anything about running a shipping company. Just watch what I do as I career around the harbour here, banging into Kay Cottee's yacht and causing alarm amongst all the recreational yachtsmen on the weekend. Just watch what I do.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, they did, and as a result poor old ANL lost $20 million-odd since they took charge of it. Poor old ANL's value has dropped from what it was reported to be when they took charge of it, around $30 million, to what it is reported to be today, between $4 million and $5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the expertise that you could say these people&mdash;Malcolm and Neville&mdash;had, which is stitching up a deal, you might have thought that the one thing they could have done was to ensure they had plenty of bidders in there for the damn thing. When we started the bidding process for ANL there were three bidders. Enter our friends and what do we end up with? One bidder; the other two dropped out. So you can hardly say that their expertise was of any great value or that the money that was paid to them was of any great value to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the BIE's analysis of the government's performance in the maritime industry proves the point that this government has been misleading us about the performance of the waterfront. We had a lot of debate this morning in the House about how important it is for people to tell the truth and not misrepresent things in the parliament. But the BIE proves the point that we have been misled in matters spoken of in this House on occasions in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront report proves how incompetent this government is when it gets down to doing something in any detail related to a business. It proves that this government has not told us the truth. It proves how grossly irresponsible this government is with the public's money. It proves how generous this government can be to their mates, whether they are the wharfies, the seamen, Neville Wran or anybody else. It just proves how generous this government can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can conclude this MPI today by remaking the points that this government's waterfront reform program has been proven by the BIE's report to have failed and that the $440 million expended on it has been wasted. The BIE report, which the government refuses to this day to release, proves to us that this government no longer deserves to be at the helm.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the great difference between our government and the opposition when it comes to micro-economic reform. We are the doers. We are the ones who go and do the job. We are the ones who make it happen. It is our government which has been responsible for all of the significant steps in reform on the waterfront and all of the significant steps in improving productivity. You have to ask yourself: what did the coalition ever do to reform the waterfront during their long years in office? Absolutely nothing. Not a darn thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Hume has the gall to come into the House and talk about the government's record. This is from a party that achieved nothing in government and left the waterfront in an absolutely disgraceful state. Yet again the member for Hume seems to have conveniently forgotten what was achieved during the three years of the WIRA program. Let me, once again, in these few minutes available to me, remind him of those achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a 57 per cent reduction in the size of the work force: 4,479 workers accepted retirement and redundancy packages&mdash;4,479. For the first time ever, it was a labour force directly employed by stevedores rather than the old pooled arrangement. Our government replaced the 21 awards with one award&mdash;the stevedoring  industry  award. Multiskilling and a skills based career path were introduced in the waterside area for the first time. Shift times were made more flexible. Seven unions in the area have reduced down to three unions. This is a proud program of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overtime worked by waterside workers is down by 25 per cent. The use of casualisation considerably increased. Enterprise bargaining was introduced for the first time&mdash;enterprise bargaining that resulted in agreements meeting many of the needs of the individual enterprises and the individual sites. There was an 88 per cent reduction, as I said in the House this afternoon, in time lost by accidents on the waterfront. There was also an increase in container crane rate productivity of 50 per cent and in net shipping working rates of 64 per cent. This is no mean feat, yet the honourable member walks into the House and says, `Oh, there has been no reform at all,' and his MPI today asserts that there has been a complete failure in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a 24 per cent reduction in container terminal charges. There has been a 45 per cent reduction in ship turnaround time, and we have seen container cargo availability improved. It is now at five to seven days, whereas it used to be at 10 to 21 days. I have indicated there is still some distance to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BTCE has indicated that in that first year it made the assessment that the benefits which have flowed to the owners of non-bulk cargo, as a result of the program, totalled no less than $267 million. That is right&mdash;$267 million in 1993 alone. In relation to reforms affecting bulk cargo, grain and fertiliser, the constituents that the honourable member would pretend to represent saved a further $9 million during that one year alone. These are savings that accrue year in, year out. They are not a flash in the pan; they are not a one-off effort. They go on year after year, and they now amount to more than half a billion dollars of savings accumulated year after year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen waterfront productivity improve greatly. We have seen it up very considerably from the start of that WIRA process. In December of 1993, the crane rate at Brisbane was, as I have said, 13.3 per cent. The figure at the end of March this year&mdash;which, I have to say, is a later figure than the figures that the honourable member has been quoting&mdash;was 18.4 per cent.

It is not a matter for me to determine the timing of that&mdash;that is done by the BTCE. It will outline all of these crane rates. Let me tell you what it will say, and these are the March figures this year. The figure for Brisbane was 13.3 per cent at the end of March this year; it is up to 18.4&mdash;a 38.3 per cent increase in productivity, even though there was a 61 per cent increase in the containers handled there. There was a huge increase in volume, but at the same time there was a 38.3 per cent increase in productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the story that is replicated right around the other five ports in the work that has been undertaken by the BTCE. At Sydney, it was 13.3 per cent at the start of the program. It is now, in this year's March figures, 18.9 per cent&mdash;up by 42 per cent. Melbourne was 12.4 per cent at the start. In March this year it is 20.8&mdash;up by 70 per cent. In Adelaide, it was 15.8 per cent at the start. It is now, in March this year, 21.5 per cent&mdash;up by 36 per cent.

What you will see from those figures will be very consistent with that March figure. So it is no good the honourable member coming in here and trying to mislead the House by not referring to the latest figures and by asserting that there has been no waterfront reform in Australia. The fact is that for the five ports, since the start of WIRA, the average crane rate has gone from 13.4 per cent up to 19.9 per cent. That is the five-port average&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, during the same period, the total number of containers that were handled doubled. You cannot play with the truth in this business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen double the productivity with half of the work force, and we have seen ship turnaround times falling. The Department of Transport has been advising that in Sydney we have seen the figure drop from 44 hours in ship turnaround time in 1989 down to 25.9 hours for the March quarter of this year, 1995&mdash;a 59 per cent reduction. I would like to see it go lower still, but it is still a 59 per cent reduction. Having said all of this, the point I have been making again and again is that the industry has only completed half the tasks to date. There is still a long way to go. Peter Storey, the Managing Director of Patricks, put it this way last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the minister's claim that waterfront reform has been a `huge success' is right, but if people look at that as being the end of it then they're wrong, and I'm sure Mr Brereton doesn't think that's the end of it either.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say that I certainly do not think that is the end of it, not for one moment. That is why I said this three weeks ago at a meeting of the Australian Shipowners Association when I released their report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government has established the framework for waterfront reform and the responsibility for pursuing world class performance now lies with the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA>They have to do the job. It is fair to say that there is some evidence that both the stevedores and the unions are pursuing that goal. They have to, because the rest of the world is not standing still, so they cannot stand still either. </PARA>

Commencing in September this year, it aims to reduce berth occupancy there from 71 per cent to 40 per cent; to increase hourly handling rates by 75 per cent; and to introduce a 24-hour a day seven days a week operation. Work is already under way in adapting that plan for its operations in Brisbane, Melbourne and Fremantle. It would not hurt you to acknowledge some of this. That is the great effort being put in by Conaust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing very significant new investment in equipment and technology from Conaust and Patricks&mdash;Conaust with $140 million, because they have satisfied themselves that the benefits of waterfront reform are real and sustainable. That is why they are putting in $140 million worth of private sector money. Sydney gets two new cranes, six rubber tied gantry cranes and a more extensive hard stand. Melbourne gets two new cranes, ten straddles and a replacement hard stand. Last week Conaust announced compliance with Australia's quality assurance standards at Glebe Island and at White Bay. Quality assurance will soon follow with the other Conaust facilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honest to goodness!  If that was a high profile response by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to the attack of the shadow minister for transport, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), on the government's performance of waterfront reform, then it was pathetic. The minister is leaving the chamber, unfortunately. I will take some time to try to wake us up after the minister's little expose with sheep.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we learned that Australia has a national debt of some $181 billion. While our country drowns in a sea of debt, the minister and this government wring their hands in pious denial of their culpable responsibility for huge inefficiencies in our sea transport industries. There are three issues that I will address this afternoon: first, the waterfront; second, Australian National Line; and, third, trans-Tasman and coastal shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current account deficit is really made up of two components. There are two problems that largely contribute to our difficulty financially to pay our own way in the world. One of those is national savings but, perhaps more importantly, another is our negative balance of trade. One of the things that impacts most seriously on that negative balance of trade is cost to industry. There is a whole range of costs that industry has imposed on it from outside over which it has little or no control. We talk about the need to address those as micro-economic reform, but that is a very long phrase of economic jargon. I prefer to talk about it as cost inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest cost inefficiencies that we face in Australia is the cost of international transport. Everybody knows that we are an island continent in the bottom of the Pacific a million miles from anywhere, and it is very expensive for us to import and export. If we want to pay our way, we need to export from Australia an equal value, and hopefully more value, of what we import. If the cost of transport impacts on our cost of trying to compete in Europe, America or Japan, then we have a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister knows he needs to fix up the mess. It has been a mess for a long time. The minister has fiddled at the edges a bit. He has done a bit here and a bit there. Sure, his container numbers are a little better here and there, and he has crane numbers. He has numbers for just about everything but, unfortunately, he does not have numbers from the BIE report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that at every turn the minister takes he comes slam-bang up against the trade unions. The ACTU and the MEU pull the minister's strings. The minister cannot make a decision by himself to improve efficiency on the waterfront, coastal shipping and trans-Tasman shipping. He cannot do anything about ANL because he is controlled by his political mate, the ACTU. Jennie George said to Bryan Noakes on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> in October 1993 after the 1993 election:</PARA>

<PARA>The union movement supported the ALP at the polls in my electorate, in the electorate of the honourable member for Hume and in the electorate of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou). The ALP was out on the ground and they demand their due. We are paying for it in the high cost of shipping and transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jennie George carried this on last Sunday morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>. When asked, `Can you work with the coalition? Can you work with Peter Reith in government?' she said, `No, we can't.' How ideologically blinkered. I reckon it is the first time I have heard an ACTU president or secretary actually come out and say, `No, we cannot work with a conservative government.' What a lot of rot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions have always worked with conservative governments and have probably worked better with them than with this lot, the ALP, because there was no accord and the unions could not pull the strings. They would not pull the strings of a coalition minister for transport. That is a fact. The member for Hume would not have his strings pulled by Jennie George. Perhaps we would get some real waterfront reform. And that is not rhetoric, mate; that is fair dinkum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not supposed to have the BIE report because the minister does not want anybody to have it. It does reach some very interesting conclusions. The shadow minister talked about what was happening on the waterfront in terms of crane movements and containerisation. I will talk briefly about break-bulk. For those of you who do not know, break-bulk is any loose cargo such as steel, coil, timber, newsprint, motor vehicles and so on. The BIE report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In late 1994 Australia's non-terminal waterfront charges for break-bulk cargo were high by international standards. Indeed, the lowest charges in Australia are equivalent to the more expensive ports on the west coast of North America. BHP Transport&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which did part of the work for this report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognises that Australian port authorities have subsequently made some reductions to their charges. However, Australian waterfront charges are substantially above those applying to ports in the southern United States, Mexico and Panama.</PARA>
<PARA>Mexico&mdash;got it? The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Port authority and auxiliary charges are the main causes of differences in waterfront charges between the Australian and the southern American ports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">BHP Transport has also compared the productivity of loading operations for a number of its steel products. Stevedoring costs in Australia are consistently higher than for a wide selection of ports in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. These higher loading costs reflect a combination of low productivity and relatively high wages.</PARA>
<PARA>`Low productivity and relatively high wages.' The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reforms to work practices and modernisation of facilities must be high priorities.</PARA>
<PARA>The report then goes on and reaches a major conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's performance in break bulk urgently needs improving.</PARA>
<PARA>It does not say that it is terrific. It does not say that the minister has done a great job. It says that it has to be fixed. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be difficult for Australia to develop a reputation as a reliable supplier of elaborately transformed manufactures if the timeliness and reliability deficiencies of containing and break bulk operations are not urgently addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not an indictment of this minister in this government, I do not know what is. The second issue I will address very briefly is ANL. While the shadow minister talked about the payments that are made to Neville Wran and his friends in order to try to decide what to do with ANL, in fact the unions are pulling the government's string on ANL as well. In this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, it is reported that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The P&amp;O group has rejected a Federal Government proposal that the Commonwealth retain 15 per cent equity in ANL Ltd and is considering an alternative package in a bid to allay union concerns about the shipping line's future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adding to the urgency for the Government to resolve the impasse over ANL, Canberra has been warned by the company's chairman, Mr Neville Wran, that the shipping line will be unable to trade beyond next February unless it receives a capital injection from the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>It is going broke again. No matter that they sold off the profitable bit; they used almost all the $18 million they got from the profitable bit. The important lot out of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the union movement's campaign to scuttle the sale of ANL has been stepped up with the powerful Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union yesterday warning the Government that it would join the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) if it decided to embark on a national waterfront strike.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we have got. We have got the unions telling the government what they can do with ANL, just as they have told the government for years that they would not reform the trans-Tasman shipping cartel. They would not allow those vessels to be recrewed efficiently and financially responsibly, any more than they will get rid of cabotage around the Australian coast, which costs all of us so dearly for shipping Australian goods from Tasmania to the mainland and vice versa. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted for question time, I referred the House to comments by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). On 19 August he told South Australian Liberals:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I warn all of you to put on your political raincoats because you're going to be showered with lies and distortions.</PARA>
<PARA>I made that comment after listening to the contribution of the shadow minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in the debate on the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I also note that the member for Flinders made a very wide ranging contribution to the debate with the courtesy of the chair, and it is my intention to follow the path that he took. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my initial contribution, I referred to the Liberal Party policy as we know it and as adopted by Liberal state governments. I referred to two-bottle Gude in Victoria. Surely, it is the most famous industrial relations reform this country has ever seen because it was established over two bottles of scotch on the weekend. What is more astonishing is the fact that the state minister revealed to the public that his industrial relations policy was developed over two bottles of scotch on the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian industrial relations legislation was a disaster. I refer the House to 14 contracts which were prepared under Jeff Kennett's industrial relations legislation in Victoria. Those contracts were pretty extraordinary. They were work contracts. Of those 14 contracts, in most cases the hourly rate of ordinary pay was not included. So it was not possible to determine the hourly rate of pay because the legislation did not provide for an hourly rate of pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those 14 contracts, nine abolished penalty rates for weekend shifts or work on public holidays. Three of those contracts reduced penalty rates or overtime rates. Three of the contracts abolished paid public holidays. Four of the contracts reduced or took away sick leave. Three of the contracts abolished employer superannuation contributions. Five of the contracts provided for an increase in working hours&mdash;in one case up to 50 hours per week&mdash;or they did not specify any minimum hours to be worked under the contract. Two of the contracts provided that the worker could be sacked due to injury or ill health causing that worker to be unable to work. Two of the contracts provided for automatic stand-down if no work was available. Four of the contracts reduced and abolished meal allowances. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> For the information of members in the House, before the quorum was called I was referring to the Victorian industrial relations legislation produced by two-bottle Gude. I was referring to the contracts which resulted from that legislation. I pointed out that in two of the contracts that we have seen in Victoria the employee can be sacked summarily for distributing printed or written material without the permission of management. In one of those contracts, the employee could be sacked summarily for showing disrespect to a director of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another contract, and perhaps the worst we saw, if the employee was late for work and did not give more than two hours notice of the absence, he was liable under the contract for all of his colleagues' wages for the time they were not able to perform the work in his absence. This is an example of the conservatives' industrial relations policy when they are in government and passing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the opposition, through its leader, the Hon. John Howard, have adopted the 1993 Western Australian industrial legislation. Two of those bills&mdash;the Workplace Agreements Bill and the Minimum Conditions of Employment Bill&mdash;are a reflection of where the opposition stand in industrial relations. The legislation is just a product of an outmoded, ideological view of the world held by the Western Australian Liberal Party and supported by the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and a number of anti-worker solicitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dismissal laws in the Western Australian legislation are pretty frightening. The legislation suggests that workers can remain on state awards if they wish&mdash;which is not quite true. If an employer wishes to move his or her employees out of the award system and onto individual contracts, the employees are virtually powerless to resist. Respected industrial lawyer Rene Le Miere and former Commonwealth industrial relations minister Ian Viner QC have given their studied view on the legislation in Western Australia. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect prospective employees who wish to be employed pursuant to an award rather than a workplace agreement in circumstances where the prospective employer requires that they enter into a workplace agreement as a precondition to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect employees who have entered into workplace agreements in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept less favourable terms and conditions of employment in a new workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, you can get the sack if you disagree. They continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect employees in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept the terms and conditions of employment in a workplace agreement proposed by the employer, except in the situation where an employer has not previously entered into a workplace agreement. Whether the employee is actually protected will depend upon the particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if you are a worker in Western Australia and they want to move you off an award and on to a workplace agreement and you say no&mdash;which is your choice&mdash;you can get the boot without any recourse to an industrial relations tribunal. There is no protection for the worker at all. They further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation does not protect employees if their employer dismisses all its work force by notice, advertises their jobs and then employs only those persons, including the former employees, who are willing to enter into a workplace agreement on the terms and conditions specified by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the policy of the federal opposition. This is the policy adopted by John Howard. Despite the fact that he says they will not accept the second tranche of legislation in Western Australia, this legislation is already law in Western Australia. This is the policy of our conservative opponents in this place, and every employee in Australia should take a good look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the threats of an employer breached the act, the employee faces Hobson's choice. If he or she resists the intimidation and takes legal action against the employer&mdash;which would be at great financial cost to the employee&mdash;the employer can still carry out the employer's threat. The employee still loses his or her job. Some protection!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the shadow minister for industrial relations point out here that they are concerned that employees should be protected. Yet this is the very legislation he would adopt as a minister in this place. So there is no protection. Quite frankly, the House is being grievously misled by the claims of the shadow minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other parts of the legislation which require the Commissioner for Workplace Agreements not to register agreements unless satisfied that the employee was not persuaded to enter the agreement by threat or intimidation give no real protection to the employee. While the agreement cannot be registered, nothing stops the employer carrying out the employer's threat to dismiss the employee by notice and recruit another willing to take the job on the employer's terms. This the opposition's freedom of choice. This is freedom of choice for the employee negotiating with an employer. It is a notion of freedom of choice that, frankly, is ludicrous. There is no choice for an employee in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a statement by a previous conservative Attorney-General of Western Australia on the introduction of Western Australia's first conciliation and arbitration legislation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> The former Western Australian Attorney-General, a conservative, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That phrase `freedom of contract' must not be taken in its literal acceptation: we must look at the condition of the people, the circumstances surrounding those who are making that contract; and except both parties to the contract to be placed on a level, there is no equality of contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be called a contract when one person has a rod in his hand, and the other has to submit to be punished.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act ploughed untilled soil in 1994 when the Industrial Relations Reform Act came into force on 30 March of that year. Prior to that time, we relied largely on state based provisions to take care of any problems which were inherent in the termination of employment. Prior to that time, the federal jurisdiction relied on the conciliation and arbitration powers of the constitution&mdash;specifically, section 51(35).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was on 30 March 1994, when the reform act came into force, that this Labor government overturned almost a century of constitutional operation in Australia&mdash;of industrial relations which adhered to the intent, to the largest extent, of the framers of our constitution. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) last year turned all of that on its head when he determined that he would rely on the external affairs power of the constitution in order to bring in ILO convention No. 158 and ILO recommendation No. 166 in order to be able to control the termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my viewpoint, it was a great negative in Australian law when finally the government took the route of overturning the intent of the founders of our constitution, who wanted matters of industrial relations handled by states' parties, the original colonies. They wanted it handled as close to the workplace as possible, and that is inherent in the words of the constitution. But this minister, because of his need to satisfy the ACTU over what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had promised the nation in April 1993, was forced to kowtow to the unions and was forced to bring in a measure which had not been contemplated by either him or the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We managed quite well in Australia for a very long time with state tribunals and state laws relating to termination of employment. I must say that the Cain-Kirner government in Victoria did rather get it wrong when they set up a tribunal to hear unfair dismissals, and so overbalanced the tribunal system that employers were given no consideration in the equation whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of a case in my electorate where an employer&mdash;a small carpet laying company&mdash;found himself needing to hire a new secretary for his premises. Because the girl who worked for him had a better job offer and she decided to leave, she placed an advertisement in the paper and replaced herself, in essence. The appointed morning came and the new lass showed up for work. She came in while the owner was discussing with a client the colour of carpet. I should say that he used subcontractors to lay the carpet, so there was just the proprietor and his secretary/girl Friday. When she came in he said, `Would you mind making a cup of coffee? I am just discussing the colour of the carpet with a client and I will then show you your duties.' She said, `I don't make coffee.' He said, `Would you mind getting the vacuum and cleaning up a bit while I finish here with the client?' She said, `I don't hoover.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By two o'clock that afternoon they had agreed that they were not meant for each other. But she said to the employer, `Look, just in case I don't find another job, how about giving me the sack?' Reluctantly, he said, `I really shouldn't, but okay, fair enough, I will.' Within seven days he had an unfair dismissal notice on his hands. That is an example of the kind of thing that happens when you overbalance the equation, when you give one side of the argument too much power. With that example as an exception, we managed pretty well with state based laws in respect of unfair dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill represents a third set of amendments and modifications to the federal law since it came into effect on 30 March 1994. Members will recall that we attended this House not long after the legislation came into effect in order to straighten it out, because the minister had included in the bill that management and employees were included, there was no limit on salary and there was no limit, in effect, on damages that an employee could extract through the Industrial Relations Court&mdash;not the commission, but the court. That proved almost immediately to be unworkable and there was a hue and cry around the country. The minister backflipped at about a million miles an hour and brought in a bill in order to modify this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations under this legislation have been modified on two occasions, and here we are once again, less than two years after it came into force, modifying the legislation again. We on this side of the House tried to tell the government at the time that the minister had got it wrong. You cannot put all the power in the hands of an employee with respect to termination and expect employers to keep hiring people. It is not a legitimate expectation. That is a scenario that the Industrial Relations Reform Act set up, because what we put in place with ILO convention No. 158 and recommendation No. 166 was a set of procedures which must be followed in order for an employer to terminate the employment of an unsatisfactory employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has transpired in practice has been that the court has not dealt with issues of equity, fairness or reality; it has dealt with procedure. Procedure is important, as we know. We experienced today an issue in which we on this side of the House believed that procedural fairness had perhaps not been followed. But procedural fairness is not all of the equation. Employers were required under this act&mdash;until this amendment is passed; if it is passed&mdash;to prove that the employee was unsatisfactory. The employee did not have to prove that the employee had been unfairly dismissed. So the employer is required to prove that a whole set of procedures have been followed, including warnings, written warnings and confirmation of what will happen if changes are not made in an employee's attitude, to the point where people who have lied, cheated and stolen from their employers have been reinstated by the commission, with damages as well. The situation had become intolerable, so the minister has brought to us once again a set of reforms to try to make his very bad original legislation a bit better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July this year the Prime Minister wrote a letter to Mr Christopher Edwards, the Chairman of the National Small Business Forum, reflecting on issues affecting small business. Amongst other things, discussing the Small Business Forum, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of those issues recently has been the legislation relating to unfair dismissal. I was pleased that the government was able to announce the proposed changes to the unfair dismissals provision of the Industrial Relations Act in the lead-up to the forum held in June. I have been told the proposals were well received by the members of the forum. I am glad that we have been able to respond to the concerns of the sector.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are confident that the new&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and `new' is the important word&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unfair dismissal arrangements will mean that the system is reasonable and balanced for both employees and employers.</PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment, fair dinkum! Why bring in a bill in the first place the provisions of which everybody under the sun&mdash;the employers, the employer bodies, the representatives of industry, and the members of the coalition on both this side of the House and our side of the Senate&mdash;tried to tell you were not workable, not fair in principle because they were not balanced. They gave undue emphasis to procedure. Also, they gave to employees almost a guarantee of permanent employment, once they had got a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this means in the real world, quite frankly, is that people stop hiring. It does not have a big effect on big manufacturers or big employers, whether in the processing, mining or chemical industries, because they have in place procedures and systems to be able to deal with personnel; they have personnel departments. And, yes, the more detailed and prescriptive the procedures are, the more people they have to hire, the higher the overheads&mdash;but it is a small fraction of their operating cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a small business proprietor with two or three employees. If that proprietor finds he cannot dismiss an employee&mdash;perhaps it is one who constantly shows up late for work, one who does not show up for work at all without reasonable excuse, or one who takes money out of the till&mdash;who clearly is not satisfactory for his business purposes, then he will not hire. That proprietor simply will stop employing people because he cannot afford to run his business in such a manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the kinds of problems that we set up with the legislation. If the Prime Minister says that the new unfair dismissal arrangements will mean that the system is reasoned and balance for both employees and employers, for heaven's sake why did he not get it right 16 or 17 months ago? It is a nonsense to come in here and say, `Well, we're going to make it fair now; we started out making it unfair.' That is terrific&mdash;great for micro-economic reform, great for Australian industry and great for revitalising the manufacturing sector in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never met anyone anywhere who, having been dismissed, thought it was fair. That is a reasonable proposition, isn't it. I cannot imagine that, if I were dismissed, I would think it was very fair. We can safely assume that 100 per cent of the time, if an employer dismisses an employee, the employee believes that he has been unfairly dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the total number of people in Australia who have been dismissed, if we create a system which is balanced in favour of the employee who has been dismissed, and if we make it all procedural based, then we make it likely that every dismissed employee will take his grievance to a court. And we make it likely that most businesses, not having the money to afford solicitors, barristers and time in front of a court, tribunal or commission, will in the end acquiesce and pay up what the employee wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently had a case like that in my electorate. A small business person with a small shop hired one employee to work every Monday on a part-time basis. He knew, before he hired the employee, that the employee also worked from home doing the same job from time to time. So he discussed with the employee the need for the employee not to take the owner's customers away from the owner's business and do her job with them at home. The employee clearly understood this. After the employee had been in on the part-time basis to work for only two Mondays, the employer found out that she had already stolen one customer. So he dismissed the employee. Unfair dismissal. He had needed to carry this on for another five or six weeks, warning the employee over and over again, both verbally and in writing, before he could dismiss her&mdash;this temporary employee who had completely violated his trust and was trying to undermine his business by taking his clients away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation is all about procedures; it is not about equity nor is it about reasonableness. There should be a reasonableness test in all of this. But I will give it to the minister&mdash;who, once again when we are debating matters industrial, is not in the House; that is par for the course&mdash;that this time the bill is more balanced; it is better. He has taken it out of the Industrial Relations Court, which was an inappropriate place for it to be, and put it into the commission. That gives us a better shot. In fact, I believe that at 9 June this year, over 10,000 matters under the unlawful termination provisions of the act had been filed with the court; 7,300 of those had been finalised, but only seven per cent were dealt with by the court, the rest having been settled in some manner or other. So it is clear that we do not need a federal court in order to deal with unfair dismissals. We told the minister that when he brought the legislation in originally. At least he has finally gotten that part right, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The onus of proof was so far reversed in the original legislation that it made employees almost absolutely untouchable. An article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 25 October 1994 that put this in some perspective. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers will not be able to legally sack employees for excessive absenteeism if they cannot prove the worker is not ill under a ruling which throws new doubt on the termination rights of employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawyers said the ruling effectively required employers to prove the almost impossible, and cast doubt on any terminations involving circumstantial evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>It did not work very well. When the Prime Minister went to address the small business forum, he would have known that they were unhappy with the survey which was set out in an article headed `Small business unhappy with dismissal procedures: survey' published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 23 September 1994. That article stated that the responses of employers, when asked what the major impediments were to them hiring new staff, were: `lack of work or sales' 33 per cent; `costs of labour or wages' 20 per cent; `need more profit' 16 per cent; and `hard to dismiss, wrongful dismissal', et cetera, 13 per cent. So that was the fourth most important reason why employers were not hiring people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 July 1995, in a speech at the Menzies Research Centre, Professor Judith Sloan, on the bill we are debating here today, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The press coverage of industrial relations matters over the past several months might suggest to the casual observer that the main problem with the `reforms' has been the hopelessly complex and unbalanced unfair dismissal provisions, provisions that were described by a Judge of the Industrial Relations Court as a "charter of workers' rights".</PARA>
<PARA>Have you got that? Charter of workers' rights. That is really what these procedures have been&mdash;and they have been an absolute disgrace. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that these provisions were, and will remain even after the changes announced on June 21 1995, deficient&mdash;they are overly legalistic and costly; they place too much emphasis on procedural fairness without consideration being given to the substantive reasons for the dismissal; there is an imbalance in the handling of matters between federal and State jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA>She has said it all. That is right. It is no wonder that employers cite the act as a reason for not expanding their employment, when the conditions relating to employing people have been made that hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No reasonable, sensible employer wants to hire someone and then get rid of them. It is very expensive to hire and train new people, and to get them used to your operation and the way you do things. Employees are an asset to any business, any company. No-one in their right mind would dismiss employees, without a very substantive reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some employers will pick the wrong person or there may be some who perhaps vindictively will take a personality difference out on an employee&mdash;and in those cases we need, in a procedurally fair manner, to make sure that those employers are dealt with, and dealt with properly. This legislation, I have no doubt, will see to that. I myself do not believe that the legislation goes far enough. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the businesswoman&mdash;she is from the hairdressing trade&mdash;came to my electorate office with her complaint, I explained to her the provisions. The nature of her complaint was that she had been believing some of the untrue propaganda from members of the Liberal and National parties. Once I explained to her the truth of the matter and gave her some of the literature provided by the government, she went away content that these provisions are fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, the average employer in Australia who is fair and reasonable would not have any problem whatsoever with the provisions of the unfair dismissal laws. Employers will be even more pleased because of the outstanding amendments to those laws that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has now brought before the House. Employers were not necessarily unhappy in the past. I am giving a valid and truthful account of the circumstances in my electorate. Employers are much more likely to be happy in the future because of the amendments now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is reflected in this is an attitude to industrial relations, an attitude to the workplace. This government believes, and this government's legislation reflects, that the workplace does not involve a master-slave relationship. In a civilised society, workers are not slaves. In a civilised society, workers are not servants. In a civilised and decent society, workers have rights that need to be respected and protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair, civilised and decent to issue warnings to workers at enterprise level. It is fair, civilised and decent to try to assist the employee to overcome a particular problem. That is fair and reasonable. We would do it in our own work as members of parliament. Consultation, cooperation and decency in the workplace increase productivity. They promote teamwork, cohesion and a shared sense of direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that in the 1990s all these things are part of the fabric of a modern and effective industrial relations framework. In an open economy we need continuous investment and continuous upgrading by business. That will not be achieved by employers trying to divide and rule, by employers thinking they have a licence to sack at will and by employers thinking they have a licence to be indecent and fire employees at will. None of those things will be achieved. In an environment where we require continuous investment and upgrading by business, these unfair dismissal provisions are entirely appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of parliament have experience with these provisions. I was interested to hear that no opposition member of parliament, as an employer of a small number of people, has related to the House in this debate that these provisions are unsuitable for their own circumstances. If they are not unfair to us, as employers of a small number of people in our electorate office, we could reasonably expect that these are decent provisions for small business and, indeed, the entire business sector in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that these provisions have stopped employment growth is totally untrue. One need only look at the number of new jobs created in Australia since March 1993 to understand that. More than 600,000 new jobs have been created in the Australian economy. We cannot accept the simplistic argument about small business in employment. The opposition is trying to advance the notion that, because there are 850,000 classified small businesses in Australia, if each employed one more person unemployment in Australia would be solved. The opposition is trying to say that the federal unfair dismissal provisions are stopping that employment of one extra person. That is totally simplistic and totally unrealistic when one looks at the fabric and structure of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rob Bastion, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations, gave an address to the National Press Club on 23 August. Let me outline some of his comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has approximately 870,000 firms. ABS defines some 850,000 or 98 per cent of these as "small" in employment terms using thresholds of 100 in manufacturing and 20 in retail and rural.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware that small firms employ between 52 and 58 per cent of the private sector work force and, depending on who you read, generate 30 and 40 per cent of our nation's added value or wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average firm in Australia employs between five and seven people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the ABS, in the financial year 1992-93, 419,000 of these businesses employed nobody. Though I suspect they really do support some. It would help a lot if our public policy makers could reflect on that a little.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I have reflected on it a lot, and I think it is quite an important statistic. Even though the ABS classifies 850,000 small businesses in Australia, 420,000 of those&mdash;almost half&mdash;employ nobody. They are sole traders. My feeling is that they show up in the statistics because the ABS is lagging behind changes in the nature of work. We have seen the growth in Australia in household and business outsourcing and contracting out. In the so-called information age we are seeing more specialisation and flexibility and businesses are becoming small and adaptable units. Those who might have been classified as workers under previous industrial structures are now being classified as small businesses. But in reality these tradesmen, consultants and information workers working on their own are still doing most of their work for the same company, but they are doing it by contract, not by our traditional notion of the employer-employee relationship. In many respects these sole trader and sole worker enterprises are a product of labour market deregulation and a product of changes in the nature of work. They are not likely to be beneficiaries of further labour market deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia when we talk about 850,000 small businesses, it needs to be understood that half of those businesses employ nobody. If the ABS had more relevant and more contemporary definitions and classifications for enterprises and workers, it may be deemed that people such as the tradesmen, the consultants and the information workers&mdash;in fact, what we would have years ago known as workers&mdash;are employees. The truth is that many of them do not want or need employees. Many of them do not want or need to employ another person. The simplistic argument we hear from small business leaders and from Liberal and National Party members of parliament that if every small business in Australia employed one more person there would be no unemployment in the country is just unacceptable. It is not in tune with reality because a good proportion of those small businesses do not want to employ anyone else because of the nature of the work that they are engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important&mdash;you would understand this, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;in public life and in debates such as this to guard against embellished and simplistic points of view. When it comes to small business it is also very important to guard against excessive romance. The truth is that small business people work hard, but it also needs to be understood that their businesses are small because they involve risk. They are starting out or they are subject to market restructuring. Mr Bastion made these points in his speech when he spoke about strip retailing and the problems of small business in the retail sector. Those problems are a product of market adjustment to a convenience based society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a free and open economy it should not be regarded as the government's fault that market forces take hold and produce restructuring. We should understand the nature of small business. It is risk laden. Ninety per cent of small businesses fail primarily because their risk was unsustainable in the market. This romantic view that small business can do no wrong and only government makes mistakes falls short of the mark and should be dismissed as unrealistic and untrue. There should be a realistic assessment of the needs of small business. We should be guarding against embellished and simplistic points of view and excessive romance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be trying to have an enterprise culture and an industrial relations environment in Australia that encourages business success&mdash;small, medium and large. That is one of the defining issues in Australian politics. Those in the media and around the traps who sometimes say that there is very little difference these days between the government and the opposition obviously have not read any of the policy work on industrial relations. They have not read the Accord Mark VIII or Jobsback, which is re-endorsed by the Liberal and National Party members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two very important features of industrial relations that need to be understood. The first of those relates to the enterprise culture. My argument is that enterprise culture can only be fostered through enterprise bargaining&mdash;collective bargaining in the workplace where everyone is involved and where everyone has a shared sense of direction, a shared sense of responsibility and a sense of teamwork and cohesion. That has so comprehensively been the direction of this government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns), who is in the chamber, would be aware of the great credit given to the government in this tremendous report produced by the department&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Enterprise bargaining in Australia</EMPHASIS>. It outlines all the success of this government's  policy. While I do not have time to provide the relevant quotes, I would direct members to page 2 and the excellent summary provided therein. It needs to be understood that in an open economy enterprises compete, not individuals. Enterprises need common goals, a sense of direction and shared purpose. That is the great strength of a collective approach to workplace bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the opposition advocate? It advocates the dog-eat-dog model of individual employment contracts. It advocates a system whereby each individual in the enterprise will have their own employment contract. This is a system that can only achieve the destruction of an enterprise culture. It can only lead to jealousy, distrust and suspicion in the workplace. What other reason can there be for advancing this model other than to set up a recipe for exploitation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that, if every worker has their own contract, everyone in the workplace would be so suspicious and jealous, wondering what someone else has written into their contract. It detracts totally from and it destroys the sense of enterprise culture and shared direction that is so important to economic success in the 1990s. It drives down productivity and leads to more disputes and more unemployment. It is the old John Howard formula&mdash;the stagflation: take away money from the social wage and you will produce a wages blow-out. Take away the sense of enterprise culture that has emerged in Australia, try and set people against each other&mdash;a dog-eat-dog model&mdash;and you end up with a stagflation that you left Australia with in the early 1980s.

I draw to the attention of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) cases they quoted, in particular as they related to the effect of this legislation on individuals in the workplace as recorded in court decisions. The member for Werriwa suggested that the cases that have been quoted in the House are figments of their imagination. I will report some of those that give a lie to that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear to people in the workplace and employers around Australia that the effects of this legislation in the industrial relations arena have been horrific and disastrous in terms of job creation and bringing about a fair dismissal. As for the honourable member's comments on the Accord Mark VIII, I wonder whether he has read it and whether he is just getting ready to read Accord Mark IX, which the government might just get in before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) is in the House. At least he has some understanding of the bill before the parliament and some of the implications for all workers of Australia. For the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), it will be third time lucky. This bill is the third attempt to amend the unfair dismissal laws since their inception some 15 months ago. Members on the government side have not been prepared to concede that. However, this is yet another step in repairing some of the damage done by the most disastrous laws yet devised in Australian industrial relations. The laws have cost jobs, made lawyers rich and produced some of the most bizarre judgments ever witnessed in our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfair dismissal laws have been so preoccupied with the issue of how workers have been dismissed that they have failed to ask the real question: whether the employer had a valid reason for dismissing. Whether or not employers are justified in dismissing workers has taken a back seat to the technical detail and the legalistic provisions of the legislation in the way the government has gone about this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the laws have brought forward an army of aggrieved litigants eager to press their claim for compensation and reinstatement. Since the laws came into effect in March 1994, over 10,000 claims have been lodged with the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, and fewer than 75 per cent have been finalised. Ten thousand claims&mdash;that is somewhat different from what the member for Werriwa was suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By June 1994, three months after the initial legislation, pressure forced Minister Brereton to make changes. That was the first set of changes. The government amended the legislation to limit sacked workers' access to unfair dismissal provisions and to limit the extraordinary amounts that some litigants were receiving in compensation. The minister at the table would be aware that this legislation opened a whole raft of compensation claims that were completely unreasonable and obviously not in accord with what even the government had in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, three months later, in September, new unfair dismissal claims were still flowing in at a rate of 120 a week. That is what some workers around Australia felt about this legislation: they were on a good thing and they were going to stick to it. The government resorted to calling in retired industrial relations commissioners and part-time judicial registrars to help deal with the growing backlog of claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By November the government passed additional regulation to exclude trainees, casual staff and probationary employees from accessing the unfair dismissal provisions. It is even more remarkable, and I am sure the minister at the table would understand this, that the Working Nation traineeship scheme had a special provision within the regulations to exclude the unfair dismissal provisions. What a remarkable situation: a piece of government legislation, a piece of government program, contained a provision saying that a provision in the very piece of legislation that the government is lauding here today did not apply to that program. Even with that exclusion, more claims were forthcoming. So far, 7,300 unfair dismissal claims have been finalised, compared with 452 other matters. So we have 7,000 claims balanced against 400 other more reasonable and genuine industrial relations matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers around the country have been faced with large compensation payouts, not to mention the legal costs combined with them. Because of uncertainty surrounding the provisions, employers have settled doubtful claims for $1,000 or $2,000 to avoid the legal cost of taking them to court despite the fact that they would most likely win. They made a judgment. They said, `Let's pay up. Let's not go to court and try to put up with the legal costs and all the inconvenience.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses, as other speakers on this side of the House have said, were scared to employ new staff because they were worried about the provisions of this legislation. Industrial lawyers made a small fortune thriving on the complexity of the statutory provisions within the act&mdash;the very thing the government are now addressing. For all the while, workers who have behaved in the most reprehensible manner have been reinstated with back pay because the employer did not satisfy strict procedural requirements in terminating their employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speakers on this side have indicated that very unfair set of arrangements that this legislation brought into play.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I said `Minister Brereton'. The minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, some commentators have argued that the employment protection provided in our national industrial relations legislation would discourage employers taking on new staff and result in higher unemployment. We believe we have achieved the right balance between employment creation and ensuring workers have a fair safety net to protect wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>Back in Australia, on 30 May Minister Brereton told <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is, in respect of this&mdash;and I've been around and tested it with many employers&mdash;no one, no one has any evidence to suggest that this is a brake on employment. In point of fact, the opposite is the case.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately for Minister Brereton, a survey of 600 firms in three capital cities by a Sydney recruiting firm found totally different results. Twelve per cent of the businesses surveyed had employed fewer staff as a direct result of the federal unfair dismissal laws. New South Wales employer representative Garry Brack said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've spoken now, over the last 13 months or so, to a lot of small business groups and every time this question is raised, they are the ones who say: We are not employing, either because of their personal exposure or because of somebody else they know.</PARA>
<PARA>So they fully understood the problem facing them with the unfair dismissal laws. Even if the figures tallied, they made the decision not to employ that extra person because of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, even Labor Premier Bob Carr admitted that the unfair dismissal laws were costing jobs in that state. Furthermore, 17 per cent of businesses surveyed said they had deliberately used temporary and contract staff instead of hiring new employees so as to avoid the legislation. So we have the evidence on the board that businesses were concerned about this legislation and were voting with their feet by not employing more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These comments were backed up by an anonymous employer who told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Report</EMPHASIS> on 28 July, after contesting an unfair dismissal claim:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It taught me not to employ people in staff. So the average Joe Bloggs worker&mdash;their job security is no longer.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will only employ casual staff from this point on. It costs me more on the initial stages but a lot less later on.</PARA>
<PARA>So he understood what this legislation would or could do to him. Thus, not only were the laws costing; they were also ironically having the effect of lessening job security by ensuring that more people were employed on a temporary or contract basis. Around half the growth in employment since the last federal election has been in part-time, casual or temporary employment. Members on both sides of the parliament would be aware of this. The statistics support that view. There has not been growth in full-time jobs, as so often ministers of the government are inclined to suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By now, virtually every small business operator has heard stories of workers whose dismissal was clearly justified, deserved and necessary being reinstated with compensation because one particular step was not taken by the boss in the legalistic process of bringing about a dismissal. But in May of this year Minister Brereton still was not convinced. He said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't accept, for one moment, that there are ridiculous cases under this new law . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is just like what the member for Werriwa said. By 21 June Minister Brereton had bowed to the inevitable and foreshadowed yet more changes to the act, saying in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the change will make the handling of unfair dismissals simpler, more effective and less legalistic.</PARA>
<PARA>What more convincing evidence would you need than the minister actually conceding at long last that this legislation was not working in its intent, it was legalistic and it was costing jobs. The amendments before the House are broadly in two areas. The first is to take some of the load away from the Industrial Relations Court by giving a greater role to the Industrial Relations Commission and the state jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is to try to put an end to the more ludicrous unfair dismissal judgments by requiring the court to look at all the circumstances of a case rather than the strict procedural requirements. All of us on this side are aware of cases where the practical result should have been for a dismissal to take place, yet the legalistic process prevented this. In short, the second change is designed to ensure the court looks at why a worker has been dismissed rather than how the worker has been dismissed in the legalistic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of these more ridiculous judgments where even some of the most difficult employees have won unfair dismissal cases. Even since Minister Brereton foreshadowed these amendments, the stream of adventurous decisions has continued. On 1 August, Anna Obrart, a prominent employment lawyer, wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> about the case of a man who applied to become a driver of an LPG tanker. This is quite an interesting case. The man forgot to mention on his application form that he had previously rolled a truck, which would most likely have barred him from working in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once employed, he broke the speed limit, fiddled his hours and eventually caused an accident with another motorist. Having caused the accident, he breached company policy by refusing to provide the driver of the other car with his name and details. The company promptly set up a disciplinary meeting, but the employee failed to turn up. A second meeting was organised, but again the worker did not attend, providing no excuse for his absence. When he finally did show up, he was rude and abusive to the employer. The company then decided to terminate his employment&mdash;quite a reasonable set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worker lodged an application in the industrial court, which amazingly managed to find in his favour.

I am sure he would understand the unfair nature of this particular case.

So the actual merits of this case were thrown out the window and that person was reinstated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has sought to rectify this by amending section 170DE of the act to ensure that the Industrial Relations Court has regard to all the circumstances of the case when assessing unfair dismissal claims. I commend the government on that change. This may help to remove some of the more extraordinary decisions where procedure has taken precedence over substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, two significant problems remain. The first is the issue of the burden of proof. Employers will still bear the burden of proving that the dismissal of an employee was valid. This reversal of the burden of proof has been a major problem for small businesses and has given rise to a few notable judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Mac's Foods, an employee was accused of stealing money from the till. The member for Werriwa said that that would ensure the person would be dismissed. But listen to this, Mr Deputy Speaker: other employees had claimed that the sacked worker had admitted to taking the money. The court said that there had not been adequate proof of theft. They required virtually a criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt and they dismissed the management's investigation as `amateur sleuthing'. The employee was awarded $7,000 compensation as well as getting his job back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very few small businesses with the resources to investigate the wrongdoings by staff and then bear the burden of proof of establishing the guilt of staff members to the standard required by the public prosecutor; yet that has been one of the consequences of this reversal of the burden of proof.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Conagra Wool, the company was forced to pay $11,660 to a worker who had been absent for 35 days over a two-year period, including 20 days without a medical certificate. He was given two written warnings, counselled and placed on a monthly review, during which his unexplained absences continued. The court found that the employer was in breach because the company could not prove that the man was not ill on the day he was eventually sacked. What a remarkable set of circumstances. This was a clear case of a stunning reversal of the burden of proof which most Australians would ordinarily expect to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem which remains for business is that the legislation still stipulates that temporary absence from work because of illness or injury cannot be valid grounds for dismissal. So the Conagra Wool case, where the worker had 35 sick days in two years, cannot be regarded as a valid ground for termination of employment. A remarkable set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just how ludicrous this can become was highlighted in the case of SCI Operations. In that case a man had been sacked for being absent for 2 1/2 years and was given his job back with $15,500. The worker had been on leave during a period of incapacity and was eventually sacked after refusing a number of offers to return to work. It is truly remarkable that somebody can be absent from the workplace for 2 1/2 years and the company is still obliged to take the worker back on. How do government members support that sort of situation? Thus, small business remains wary of the fact that chronic absenteeism cannot constitute grounds for validly terminating a worker's employment. The government's amendments in this bill do not address this key point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the strain on the Industrial Relations Court. The government has also tried to take the strain off the Industrial Relations Court by providing that all unfair dismissal cases will first go to the Industrial Relations Commission. That would seem fair enough on the surface. Previously, all cases went to the court, which could then refer them back to the commission for conciliation. Now the commission will deal with the matter first. The commission can endeavour to conciliate the matter and, failing that, can arbitrate the matter if both parties agree to be bound by the commission's findings. There is no compulsory arbitration, only `consent arbitration'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of limitations on the Commonwealth's conciliation and arbitration power in section 51 of the constitution, the Industrial Relations Commission has traditionally been restricted to settling industrial disputes which have an interstate character. This was usually done by compulsory arbitration. The federal government is also wary of having the Industrial Relations Commission exercising anything which could be construed as judicial powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the problem with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which the High Court held in the Brandy case was wrongly hearing and determining matters in a manner similar to a court. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was making binding judgments about discrimination matters and awarding compensation. The High Court said that only a properly constituted court under division 3 of the constitution could exercise these powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This constitutional separation of powers poses problems for the speedy resolution of unfair dismissal claims. While the commission can conciliate the matter and can arbitrate if both parties agree, they cannot bring about a compulsory arbitrated outcome&mdash;again a problem that I am sure the assistant minister at the table will understand. If they did, they would be operating very much like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was prior to the High Court decision in the Brandy case. If either party wants to go to court, they can. Having done that, the Industrial Relations Court must hear the matter de novo. Thus, the capacity for the commission to relieve the workload for the court is strictly limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the very day that Minister Brereton foreshadowed the amendments to the act, Mr Ross Levin of the law firm Clayton Utz was reported on AAP as saying that the number of claims would not be reduced. He claimed that as long as employees could force the matter to go before the Industrial Relations Court, they would do so&mdash;seeking large compensation payments. Thus, while the amendments make some progress in re-emphasising the merits of unfair dismissal cases rather than the procedural details, problems remain. The onus of proof still remains firmly with the employer; absenteeism cannot be a valid ground for dismissal; and constitutional limitations on Commonwealth power mean that the flow of claims to the Industrial Relations Court may not be stemmed in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There remain problems in industrial relations. The chopping and changing that has gone on with this legislation in its 15-month history is symbolic of the remarkable state of industrial relations in Australia. In relation to the current Industrial Relations Act, Professor Andrew Stewart, an expert in industrial law at Flinders University, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Report</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think you would find any industrial lawyer or industrial relations practitioner in this country who would be prepared to say that this current piece of legislation&mdash;forgetting its content, just in terms of the way it is put together and the amount of detail it contains, is a good piece of legislation&mdash;it isn't.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1988, when the Industrial Relations Act was first introduced, the size of the statute has, I would say, almost doubled . . . they are becoming harder and harder to understand, attempting to over-regulate in many cases and they in the end impose a great deal of cost on everyone who uses the system&mdash;on anyone who wants to litigate, on anyone who wants to seek advice. Really it's the lawyers who've been the winner out of the industrial relations system for the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA>Far from making a good system better, as Minister Brereton would have us believe, these changes make a disastrous system barely workable. What is perhaps most surprising was the ease with which the trade union movement embraced the changes to the unfair dismissal laws. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 amends six acts to amend the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act of 1988. As the Metal Trades Industry Association has observed, these changes are regarded positively by employers. We have also had some positive comment from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We welcome this bill, which implements the Federal Government's recent commitment to amend procedural fairness laws, to specifically recognise voluntary arbitration by the Industrial Relations Commission in the Act, to provide that applications are made to the Commission not the Court, and to preserve the operations of the more realistic state systems.</PARA>
<PARA>Realistically, it is fair to say that the government has had some problems in trying to strike a balance with this legislation but that we have got there on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth remembering that this legislation was required in the first place because the action of conservative state governments, particularly Victoria, was simply to rip away the whole award system. That is why this legislation was necessary. Basic protections, in states like Victoria, were withdrawn from workers. Those workers deserve to have some protection, so the Commonwealth moved in this area and in a number of other areas to provide those minimum protections. Ultimately, responsibility for this legislation coming in in the first place rests with the conservative state governments, particularly that in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition would have us believe that this and other parts of the Industrial Relations Act have such a negative influence on business that we do not have any employment growth, we do not have high investment, and we do not have any productivity growth. That is nonsense. We have very high employment growth&mdash;680,000-odd jobs since March 1993&mdash;and we have very strong productivity growth. These are very significant achievements which have been built on the backs of workers making very considerable sacrifices, as reflected in the cuts to real wages in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers made those sacrifices in the interests of making us more competitive, in the interests of job creation, in the interests of the long-term future of the country. I get a little bit saddened when I hear contributions from those opposite that fail to recognise that fact. Undoubtedly, there have been some pretty horrendous examples of what has occurred on some sides of the ledger with the unfair dismissal laws. But, equally, there would have been many cases where these basic protections have been entirely justified, justifying the existence of legislation such as this. You never hear that from those opposite. You just get this one-sided view of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Accord, and all of the legislative provisions that go with it, has delivered very great benefits to the economy, and to employers and employees. I recently read a speech made by the head of the MTIA in New South Wales, Mr Page-Hanify. On the changes to the unfair dismissal legislation, he said that the MTIA in his state had been able to achieve positive gains for employers. He went on to make other important comments about the general business environment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian industry has been performing strongly over the past few years. Manufacturing is presently growing by almost 50 per cent&mdash;faster than the overall economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Justice Statement and to take note of the paper. The Justice Statement, released recently by the government, is part of the ongoing changes in Australia's justice system. In the acknowledgments to the statement, one notes that the process of reform began with the initiatives of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), in establishing the Access to Justice Advisory Committee way back in October 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 130 submissions were received in response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> report and these contributions were invaluable in developing the initiatives and reforms announced in this statement. The Justice Statement focuses on 11 key areas and I think it is important to note them. These areas are: families; resolving disputes; lawyers; courts and tribunals; the national women's justice strategy; legal aid; accessing laws; consumer protection; tackling crime; human rights; and access across cultures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, in the time allocated to me, I do not wish to speak on all these areas, valuable though they are to the issue of justice. Rather, I would like to concentrate on the following four aspects of the statement, which are perhaps more relevant to my electorate than to others: families, resolving disputes, the national women's justice strategy, and the issue of legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my mind, these four areas are inextricably linked and, as I speak to them, I will wander across and through the four areas. Over the life of this federal Labor government, we have set out to ensure that all Australian families, irrespective of where they reside, irrespective of their race, colour, creed or socioeconomic circumstances, are catered for within Australian society. In my mind, families are a fundamental national resource&mdash;the life blood and future of our great nation. It was interesting to note that, at the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship meeting this morning, we were challenged in some of the thoughts that are behind that simple statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my lifetime, there have been huge changes to the structure, nature and operation of families, and the lines of responsibility have become extremely blurred. I guess I was lucky to have been raised in a typical family of the 1950s and 1960s. Dad was the sole breadwinner, mum raised the four children and there was a clear delineation on what constituted the role of parents and the extended family. The extended family all lived in close proximity to one another. The roles of school, the church and the local, state and federal governments were clearly delineated in that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days, families may be a range or mixture of adults and children, old and young, sometimes with one parent or, in some cases, where one relationship has broken down and another started, there may be three or more parents responsible for children. A family can now be a complex mix of relationships. Even if children are raised in the same style that I was raised, they are also very much aware of the different types of families that interact with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This federal government believes that all families need to be supported and strengthened and this is one of the key issues in this Justice Statement. This statement is all about treating families fairly, whatever their set-up. Through this Justice Statement, we have set aside $160 million to try to achieve that end. The complex nature of families is recognised, and the government has responded by providing more places in relationship courses to make sure those courses are particularly related to Australian couples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, in Tasmania, Relationships Australia&mdash;which was previously named the Marriage Guidance Council&mdash;has an excellent reputation and record, and the demand for that service is continually growing. This should be seen as a real positive within our community: that couples and families are recognising the complexities and pressures within and around them and that they want to deal with them in a positive manner. It is that need and that desire by Australians to be constructive about their relationships and their day-to-day lives which this government is responding to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family support has been an invaluable service to the communities that I represent in my electorate. I am lucky to have seven or eight of these family support services, in Gagebrook, Geeveston, Warrane, Clarendon Vale, Risdon Vale, Rokeby and the Maranoa Heights in Kingston. Particularly in these broadacre public housing areas, family support in conjunction with the neighbourhood house programs has provided not only personal support to families, but respite when it is needed for those parents who simply need a break away from the family structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family support workers have been called upon in difficult situations involving couples and their relationships with children, requiring visits to homes, arranging for additional assistance through other agencies and providing families with the security of knowing that the family support workers are there when they need them. The federal government, through the Justice Statement, will provide greater access to such family support programs throughout the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Financial counselling is another existing service in our community that will benefit from the Justice Statement. In my electorate of Franklin, Anglicare has provided a superb service to assist families going through financial difficulties by providing advice on how to better manage their household income and how to structure their whole financial set-up. Before financial counselling came into operation there was an incredibly high number of people who simply saw bankruptcy as the only solution to their financial problems. To me, that is a real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my five years as an electorate officer there were numerous times when I met with families and talked them out of choosing bankruptcy. Financial counselling will be expanded through the Justice Statement and I am well aware of the positive benefits that service will bring to families right across our nation and, more especially, in my electorate of Franklin through the services of Anglicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Resolving disputes for families is certainly an area for which this federal government believes it should have some responsibility. This government is prepared to intervene and provide assistance in this area of mediation, both within the family and in the neighbourhood context. This is a really positive way of making the community more understanding and coherent. It is also a way of keeping people out of the court system. Too often in my electorate cases appear before a court which could be sorted out through mediation and negotiation. What a waste of time and money some cases have been when they finally come to court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement provides for more adolescent, mediation and family therapy centres. It boosts funding by 50 per cent for family skills training services to assist an additional 12,000 families. To my mind, this is money very well spent. It is about the government being prepared to recognise and tackle those problems that require assistance in our community in a very constructive and positive way. This is an area we will not turn our backs on and leave to the law of the jungle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am fortunate that in my electorate there are some existing agencies controlled and operated by women for women and that the benefits they are providing to the women are incredibly important to the fabric of our society. I would like to mention the Women's Room, operating in the broadacre public housing areas of Bridgewater and Gagebrook. This is a group of local women who initially began without any funding because they recognised that women in their community required extra assistance and special assistance that could be provided only by women who lived in the area and who knew the local conditions. The national women's justice strategy will be a boon to groups like the Women's Room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy recognises that women have particular needs in relation to justice and access. Existing agencies like the Women's Room, or new groups like the one operating from the Geeveston Neighbourhood House in the southern part of my electorate&mdash;which has been funded to provide assistance to women in rural and remote areas who, together with their children, are victims of domestic violence&mdash;will be able to utilise the national women's justice strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will do this by taking their clients through new mediation programs and by seeking advice from women lawyers who are specialists in areas specific to the needs of women. Those specific needs will be addressed by the statement through pilot programs being established to explore new ways of dealing with violence in families, to train family support staff to help women leaving violent relationships, to develop legal education pamphlets and programs to inform and assist women in rural and remote areas, and to support family legislative measures to ensure the Family Court takes full account of family violence when making child access arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following on from that, one very important measure that I can see real benefits in for women and families generally is the new hand-over centres for the safe transfer of children between separated parents if there is a family history of either violence or abuse. My office has been contacted by women in the past who have been incredibly anxious about custody arrangements with their previous partners but, through Family Law court decisions, they have had no choice at all but to be confronted by the father of the child at the doorstep of the home in which they live. For too many women, this has been a terrifying experience. The new hand-over centres will provide a safe buffer between parents who no longer have a good relationship, and thus provide security and safety for the women and children, and maintain access for the children to their fathers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last issue I want to mention is legal aid, a rather contentious and thorny issue. In the Justice Statement, legal aid receives a real boost and community centres will also be great benefactors of the Justice Statement. I am lucky in the fact that I have a community legal centre based alongside my office. In some ways it is a boon and in some ways it is not. It is a boon in the fact that, rather than me and my staff dealing with a whole lot of legal issues, we can now refer them to the Derwent Community Legal Centre. But, apart from just referring them to this one-stop shop for legal advice, it is very important that the legal centre be part of this whole community structure so that we do not just fragment things off. There is a sort of cohesion throughout this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community legal centre provides counselling and it has an educative role in helping people to understand a whole lot of legal issues. It is not just there as the last resort where you go to have things sorted out on a legal basis. The Derwent centre was set up principally because all the lawyers in Hobart are in the CBD and are far removed from the problems of ordinary people. They are not close by when people need them and that situation had to be rectified. I think the community legal centres, in my state, have tackled this problem of access to the legal system. I know for a fact that, by strengthening these community legal centres, we will strengthen the whole process of people's understanding of the law, their access to it and issues of equity. I commend the federal government for the $160 million provided through the Justice Statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives, if implemented properly in consultation with all areas of Australia and through all the different agencies that have been mentioned in the statement, will enable people to better understand the process. They will keep a lot of people out of the process, empower people who are currently disempowered and provide a structure which will support and strengthen families. I commend the paper to the House. </PARA>

I think the spirit of the conduct of this chamber has been and ought to remain one where issues such as those being traversed by my colleague are not injected into the debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very pleased to contribute some comments which are directly relevant to the Justice Statement, as compared to those contributed by the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). I welcome the Justice Statement that was announced in May of this year by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as a very significant additional contribution by the federal government to the process of justice in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member for the last 5 1/2 years, I have had a duty to assist many constituents who, in a variety of ways, have had problems in accessing the justice system. I am proud to be an Australian and proud to be part of a very democratic and just society but, for that to truly operate, all people in our community must have fair and reasonable access to the justice system. The measures that were announced in May by the Prime Minister in the Justice Statement will contribute significantly to improving that access. I do not believe the statement has gone as far as some of us would like to see it go. Further work needs to be done and further financial support provided through a range of measures, but I do believe the statement provided a very solid foundation, which we should applaud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) in May announced a four-year $160 million strategy to reform Australia's justice system. The Justice Statement is what I would term a classic Labor government policy, in that it reforms key legal institutions to respond to their primary purpose of delivering justice to all people on an equal basis, regardless of who they are, where they live and how well off they happen to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms are centred upon the restructuring of the court system, the legal profession itself and legal assistance measures. The Justice Statement is an unambiguous Labor government measure. It is a clear statement of policy about where we should be going as a society and about ensuring that our justice system is accessible to all Australians. It contrasts considerably with both the opposition's performance in the past and the fact that, at the moment, there is no policy from the opposition to indicate where they would in fact go in providing an improved justice system for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement resulted from the initiative by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee in October 1993. This committee found a widespread lack of faith in the justice system from a wide cross-section of Australians. The motivating factor behind the Justice Statement has been to initiate measures to restore confidence in the justice system and have it better serve the interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several groups within the Australian community are clear-cut winners from the Justice Statement. They include families, who benefit through a range of community based initiatives to assist them to overcome their legal problems. Others benefiting include a vast majority of Australians who do not qualify for legal aid yet are not wealthy enough to afford litigation. In this category, the Justice Statement will witness significantly improved access for women, for Aboriginal Australians and for family law litigants. The government's approach reflects commitment, firstly, to resolving and preventing disputes by simple and accessible means; secondly, to reforming key legal institutions to achieve greater efficiency and consumer focus; and, thirdly, to ensuring access and equity across the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will begin with the question of resolving and preventing conflict. The Justice Statement provides much needed resources to organisations such as Relationships Australia, doubling funding for marriage and relationship education by an additional $4 million over four years. This is a very significant improvement and reflects the valuable work that Relationships Australia, formerly known as the Marriage Guidance Council, performs in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is an important role to be played in these organisations in assisting couples and families to resolve their conflicts without recourse to separation and divorce. Separation and divorce have a very destabilising and very damaging impact on families, particularly on the children of those families. It is crucial that governments, both state and federal, become more directly involved in assisting families to stay together for the benefit not only of couples, but of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, by the allocation of an extra $5.7 million over four years, the Justice Statement extends family support programs&mdash;including relationship skills training, adolescent mediation and family therapy&mdash;into rural and regional Australia. This is another area that I am particularly concerned about. I would like to see significantly more money allocated, not just for serving rural and regional Australia, but also to serve metropolitan and provincial city Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great concern to me that this community spends a lot of money dealing with the end results of family breakdowns, such as homelessness amongst youth, drug and alcohol addiction and petty crime and vandalism. I believe that these all result from a complete breakdown in the family unit, a breakdown in communication, a lack of understanding between the parents and the children about what each other's needs are, and a general lack of direction in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be spending a lot more money in providing counselling and support and advice to young people and to the parents of those young people before homelessness occurs, before they resort to drugs and alcohol to try and hide their problems. We need to be supporting family counselling to a much greater degree. Although I welcome the amount that is allocated here, we need a larger program to assist that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For five years, I have been seeking&mdash;without success&mdash;the setting up of a youth drop-in centre and referral service in my electorate. There is not a lot of homelessness in my electorate, but I believe that many of the homeless people who wander around cities and some of the suburban areas come from communities like mine. What I wish to do is to provide them with a service where they can get some counselling, some advice and support, before they leap over the cliff and leave home, or participate in unsociable behaviour, such as drug and alcohol addiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a real struggle. Although everybody says that it is a great idea to have a referral service and a drop-in centre and some counselling support for people in their local communities, there is no line item in anybody's budget that will enable it to be funded and provided. This program within the Attorney-General's Department is an important program, but it needs to be complemented with additional services from Human Services and Health and from state community services or family services departments. I would encourage all of those government departments to get together to put forward such a program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> statement also accelerates the movement in the Family Court towards mediation and counselling, by the allocation of an extra $4.3 million for  mediation services and $9.7 million over four years for counselling. Every member in this place has, from time to time, had to deal with constituents who have suffered a family breakdown and who are angry about decisions that have occurred in the Family Court. They are angry about Child Support Agency matters; they feel they have not received justice. A lot of emotion, a lot of anger and hatred, is generated. We, as members of parliament, have to try and cope with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we could have a Family Court process that placed more emphasis on counselling and mediation, on trying to bring couples together to find fair and reasonable resolutions to these matters&mdash;without those couples having to go through the litigation and court processes, the struggles for division of property, the struggles for funding and the struggles over access to children&mdash;we would have happier people out there. There would be far less call on government resources for the Family Court, and fewer of the tragedies that occur in our community as a result of family breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement also commits $16.8 million over four years to increase the number of community based mediators specialising in family mediation. It provides $2.3 million for a family violence program, as well as instigating greater coordination between Family Court and domestic violence orders. All of these initiatives are very valuable and very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement allocates $5.3 million over four years to a pilot program of safe hand-over centres for children, staffed by legal workers trained in dealing with family violence. It strengthens consumer protection in the Trade Practices Act with increased penalties. This has been a common area of complaint for those affected by poor legal representation. It creates a national network of specialist women's legal centres&mdash;one in each state and territory&mdash;with $12.3 million over four years. Further, it establishes a safer Australia program to identify crime problem areas and develop strategies to reduce crime. This initiative is responding to growing community expectations for solutions to be found to combat fears of crime in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of removing barriers to justice, the Justice Statement allocates $16.8 million over four years to legal aid commissions which improve their accountability standards and agree to spend the bulk of the new financial resources on family and civil cases, with an additional $6.9 million over four years for commissions to expand their legal aid services. This is absolutely vital. There is a huge backlog of demand for legal aid services. The funding, prior to this statement, nowhere near addressed the need in our community. As I said at the beginning of my comments, it is no good having a fair justice system if it is too expensive for the majority of Australians to access. For justice to be served, people need to have immediate access to those services and they cannot get access to them with the incredibly expensive legal processes that we have in our country at the moment. Therefore, additional funding for legal aid is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the Justice Statement creates nine new community legal centres with $13.9 million over four years, plus additional funding for the environmental defenders network, specialist services for children and youth, and a national human rights and discrimination law centre. It commits to removing virtually all advertising restrictions on lawyers operating in federal jurisdictions, enforcing greater competition in the legal marketplace and, ultimately, benefiting the consumer and client. This is also a very important reform that has been put in place, because I believe we do need to have an opening up of the legal profession. I am not a lawyer, but I do find the regulations and the way in which the industry operates to be very restrictive. It is important that we open it up and make lawyers have to face some of the same competitive pressures that others in our society have to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In restoring confidence in the administration of justice, the statement allocates $2.7 million over four years to gender and cultural awareness programs for judges and court staff. This is a timely reform in respect of recent statements which have been made by a very small minority of the judiciary but which have impacted on people's attitudes towards the justice system. Some of these statements by, as I have said, a small minority of the judiciary have displayed a lack of knowledge of views and the trends of policy in our community. They have been out of step, unfortunately, with community expectations and I think this training program will be very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement also provides $700,000 for a two-year program to develop charters of access and service in Commonwealth courts and tribunals, and it boosts the training of specialist Aboriginal language interpreters for the courts with $1.4 million over four years. As the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I particularly welcome this new initiative. It has been something that my committee has argued for for a long time. We are pleased to see there is going to be recognition in our court system that there are tens of thousands of Aboriginal people in this country who have English as their third or fourth language, that they are not natural English speakers, and that they do need access to interpreting services for them to have fair access to justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the programs outlined in the Justice Statement have been specifically targeted for the majority of Australians to enable them to have much better access and representation in the Australian legal system. It is not simply a matter of throwing money at the problem. In fact, some early criticism of the Justice Statement following its release centred upon the absence of greater financial resources to achieve a balancing of the justice scales. It is an important new reform. I welcome the Justice Statement and commend the government for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the foreword to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Status of ILO conventions in Australia&mdash;1994</EMPHASIS>, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) says that the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . aims to promote a better understanding in the Australian community of the ILO's standard-setting activities and the role that international labour standards play protecting the minimum standards of Australian workers and in the development of employment conditions in Australia. It reviews Australia's position in relation to each ILO Convention as at December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>What the honourable minister fails to refer to is that this parliament has no real role at all in relation to ILO conventions. This parliament is not consulted when conventions are signed or ratified. This parliament does not scrutinise them except by means of an ex post facto debate like this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a founding member of the ILO. The general conference of the ILO, normally referred to as the International Labor Conference or the ILC, has as one of its principal functions the adoption of formal instruments establishing international labour standards. These instruments take the form of either conventions or recommendations. They deal with a broad range of employment-related matters. Once adopted by the conference, conventions and recommendations become open to ratification by member states. There is no obligation on any state to ratify a convention and unratified conventions do not create any obligation in international law. Ratification is a sovereign act by the member state concerned. However, once ratified, conventions do create binding international obligations for the member state concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From its establishment in 1919, down to 30 November 1994, the ILC had adopted 357 standard-setting instruments: 175 were conventions, and the remaining 182 were non-binding recommendations. As at 31 August 1994, Australia had ratified 54 of the conventions. When a member state ratifies a convention, it becomes obliged to maintain its domestic law and practice in conformity with that convention. However, in Australia, no ratified convention will have any substantive legal effect in either state or federal law, unless expressly given such effect by the federal or relevant state parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitution of the ILO recognises that federal member states such as Australia have a division of legislative responsibility between the federal parliament and the constituent states. The ILO constitution provides that, where the subject matter of a convention falls wholly or in part within the area of competence of the constituent states, then the Commonwealth government must refer the convention to the state and territory parliaments for them to enact legislation or take other action. The `other action' referred to contemplates, among actions, that the state parliament may refuse to ratify the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most ILO conventions come into force in international law 12 months after they receive their second ratification&mdash;that is, a second ratification by a member state&mdash;but a convention in force internationally will not become binding on Australia until 12 months after the date upon which Australia ratifies the convention in question. Once ratified, the convention will bind Australia unless or until it is denounced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth consults regularly with the states on ILO matters, at departmental officer level. ILO matters are regularly included on the agenda of periodic meetings between state and federal labour relations ministers. These arrangements generally proceed on two bases. The first is that a convention will be ratified only when law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions is adjudged to be in compliance with the convention concerned. The second is that all state and territory governments must have formally agreed to ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second condition does not apply to those conventions whose subject matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth government alone, although in practice the Commonwealth government is still likely to seek approval from the states even though approval is not required. This consultation process is quite unusual in the context of the Commonwealth government's relations with the states and territories in the broader treaty making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only two of the 54 conventions ratified by Australia as at 31 August 1994 have been ratified by the Commonwealth government without the agreement of all the states and territories. The first was the Workers with Family Responsibilities Convention 1981, No. 156, which was ratified in March 1990. The second was on 26 February 1993, a date after the last federal election had been called. In fear of losing the federal election and in order to defeat the Kennett government's industrial relations legislation in Victoria, the Commonwealth government ratified the Termination of Employment Convention 1982, No. 158, without the formal agreement of any state or territory. Ratification of this convention was also unusual in that law and practice in no jurisdiction, including the Commonwealth, was in compliance with the convention at the time of ratification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there appears to be an established practice of Commonwealth consultation with the states&mdash;with some notable exceptions, which I have mentioned&mdash;prior to ratification of ILO conventions, this is not the case with other international treaties. The power to enter into treaties is vested without qualification in the executive arm of government, meaning, in effect, ultimately the cabinet. The executive has no formal obligation to consult the Commonwealth parliament in relation to any treaty, whether an ILO convention or any other form of international agreement, to which the executive proposes to commit Australia. Nor does the executive have any formal obligation to consult state or territory governments or any person likely to be affected by implementation of the proposed treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might have thought that the executive would jealously guard its right to enter into and ratify treaties on behalf of Australia, in the light of the failure to consult the parliament in any way. But the executive has not jealously protected the right of cabinet to approve treaties for signature or for ratification. It has recently been revealed that, since 1990, only 49 agreements or treaties have received cabinet approval for final consent, while 186 were approved only by relevant ministers or by departments acting in accordance with what were believed to be policy established by ministers or by cabinet.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fewer than a quarter of treaties entered into since 1954 have been formally approved by cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has proposed a raft of reforms of the treaty making process. The reforms include involving the state and territory governments and interest groups in consultation. This, it is pleasing to note, is something that already occurs in relation to ILO conventions, with very few exceptions. The coalition proposals provide expressly for the involvement of parliament in order to achieve wider consultation and to make the executive more accountable. It is appropriate that consideration should be given to the possibility of parliamentary ratification or a procedure for parliamentary disallowance of treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice of the executive in dealing with parliament in relation to treaties has not, over the years, been uniform. Where a treaty would have significant impact on domestic circumstances it was once the practice of the Commonwealth government to seek the approval of parliament before ratifying the treaty. Between 1919 and 1963 there were at least 55 cases in which parliamentary approval was expressly sought. This procedure has fallen into disuse. In 1961, Prime Minister Menzies promised to table treaties in parliament at least 12 sitting days before the government finally committed itself to a treaty by ratifying it or acceding to it. This appears to be a modification of the British government's so-called Ponsonby rule. The Ponsonby approach is of limited practical value in that the government is not bound to find parliamentary time for debate of a motion deploring the intention of the executive to ratify a treaty. Any such motion would, of course, be private members business and would have to fight its way through the selection committee process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one recent instance at the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991, the Keating government ratified a convention despite a motion having been moved in this House, but not debated, seeking the imposition of reservations on the ratification. Unless moved in the House by or on behalf of a minister, a motion or bill relating to a treaty will, as I have indicated, only be dealt with as private members business, of which only a fraction ever reaches the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Menzies approach has never been revoked formally, it has not been honoured. In recent years, the practice of the government has been to table treaties in bulk every six months regardless of whether the tabling is before or after ratification. A high proportion of the treaties have already been ratified or acceded to and some have even come into force before they are tabled.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to ILO conventions, however, a different practice has been followed. Sometimes the conventions are included among the bulk tabling collections. At other times, however, they are tabled independently on the return of a delegation to an ILO conference where the convention has been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Rupert Hamer, a former premier of Victoria, and Professor Leslie Zines, the eminent constitutional lawyer, both members of the 1988 Constitutional Commission, considered&mdash;although in the minority on this point&mdash;that there should be a statutory requirement that ratification of treaties by Australia should be conditional on either the approval of both houses of parliament or the non-disallowance by either house within a specified period. Their reasoning was that, having regard to the international and domestic consequences of Australia entering into treaties, the accountability of the government to the parliament in the area should be strengthened. Other interested bodies have agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a statement issued in January 1994, the Australian Mining Industry Council and seven other peak industry bodies proposed major reforms to treaty making processes that would give a significant role to the parliament. Firstly, the bodies recommended tabling of treaties with explanatory material well before signature. Secondly, they proposed the referral of treaties `with perceived national or contentious impacts' to the relevant parliamentary committee for public inquiry and report. Thirdly, they said that implementing legislation ought not be put to parliamentary vote until the parliament had had sufficient opportunity to consider whether becoming a party to the treaty would be in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Constitutional Committee in its January 1995 report reviewed, among other things, the treaty making process. The committee saw amendment of the external affairs power in the constitution as its first preference for reform of the process. Failing that, the committee recommended that all treaties be tabled in the Commonwealth parliament and that Commonwealth legislation make ratification conditional on non-disallowance by either house within a specified period from the time of tabling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to the effectiveness of the coalition proposal for tabling treaties prior to ratification is to ensure that parliamentary time is allocated for debate of the treaties. The probability is that there would be little or no interest among members or senators in debating all but a handful of the treaties, and this would be true of ILO conventions as well. In addition, a high proportion of those for which debating time is likely to be sought would have bipartisan support. The best way of ensuring that parliamentary debating time is allocated is to provide for a system of parliamentary approval or disallowance. In view of the large number of treaties likely to be uncontentious, a disallowance system is clearly the more practical. Such a system would certainly improve consultation by the executive with interest groups, it would make consideration of the national interest more meaningful and, importantly, it would provide an effective means of making the executive more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the tabling of next year's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Status of ILO conventions in Australia</EMPHASIS>. Perhaps that report, in contrast to the one before us today, will be able to inform members and senators of an increased role of the parliament in the decision to ratify further ILO conventions. It is to be hoped that next year's report will evidence greater consultation with the parliament and greater consultation with the states. It is my belief that the resulting increase in the accountability of the executive will be a characteristic of, and one of the most significant improvements made by, the new Howard government. </PARA>

The first edition of this report was in 1969. Advantage was taken of that particular year because it represented the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the ILO, which, of course, was one of those international arrangements established at the time of the old League of Nations following the First World War. When the League of Nations ceased to exist in 1946, the ILO was one of those, again international, arrangements which continued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), who always makes a considered contribution to questions of this kind. In a sense, there is some degree of departure between his position and my position. I appreciate his background in law and the thinking that he brings, particularly to the legal processes and the procedures involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is important to the government, but to people like myself there is another dimension. I am not suggesting for a moment that this is ignored by the member for Tangney or his colleagues. This other dimension is just as important as any legal consideration, and that is the whole background to this question of International Labour Organisation conventions and recommendations which are the two primary mechanisms in the ILO's approach to appropriate working conditions. And, of course, there is a need today for national governments such as ours and particularly for governments in other countries which do not honour the need for an enlightened, humane and civilised approach to the conditions under which men and women work to address such issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, I mention ILO convention No. 5, which was adopted by the ILO in 1919. It refers to the minimum age for employment in industry. We also have convention No. 123 adopted in 1965 by the ILO. This refers to the minimum age for underground work. That one was not ratified by Australia until 1971. Of the 175 conventions of the ILO, only 54 have been ratified by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am drawing particular attention to the question of minimum age in industry and in underground work for a special reason. I want to refer to a particular example. A great mate of mine, a fellow by the name of Gwillym Williams, came out to Australia as a baby with his parents from the coalfields of southern Wales where my maternal antecedents also originated. Gwillym Williams was born in southern Wales. His father was blackballed in the coal mines there and for that reason he sought to escape those circumstances by bringing his wife and his kids here. Gwillym was a little kid when he arrived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gwillym Williams left school at the age of 13, which was the leaving age at that time, and went straight into the coalmine at Bellbird. He became the youngest lodge officer ever to hold office in the Bellbird miners' lodge. In 1923, at the time of the Bellbird disaster, when coalminers were killed&mdash;those coalminers still lie in the sealed-off sections of that mine&mdash;Gwillym Williams was one who survived, as a young fellow. He died a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said to me, on at least one occasion, that he recalled that when he was a little boy going to school&mdash;before he reached the leaving age of 13 and went directly into the coalmines&mdash;he would sometimes say to his father, `Dad, will you help me with my homework?' His father would say to him, `Gwillym, you go and do the work yourself. If I help you, it won't be of any lasting value to you. You just work at it.' Then Gwillym would say, `Dad, the other kids in my class say their fathers help them with their homework. Why don't you help me with mine?' He would say, `Because I think you should work at it yourself, Gwillym.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gwillym said that light gradually dawned on him. He said to his father one day, `Dad, I know why you don't help me with my homework.' His father said, `Why is that, Gwillym?' He said, `Because you can't.' His father said, `What do you mean?' Gwillym said, `You can't read or write.' His father said, `Gwillym, you're right. I can't read or write.' Gwillym said, `Why can't you, dad?' Gwillym's father said, `Son, I can't read or write because I never went to school. I went with my father into the coalmines when I was seven years of age. We would go down the mine in the morning before the sun came up, and we would come out of the mine in the evening after the sun had gone down. I never saw sunlight, except on Sunday. So I didn't go to school and I can't help you with your homework.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That fellow conveyed that message to me. It was within his experience. The point I wish to make is that we know that there are other young kids&mdash;working at looms, working in the fields, working in factories and, still, working in mines&mdash;in different parts of the world who also need to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to questions of compensation for industrial accidents and industrial diseases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the particular elements of the ILO general approach are reflected in the preamble to its constitution. I want to read part of that preamble, because I find it a laudable and civilised statement about issues about which I feel very strongly. The preamble to the constitution of the organisation concerns its principles and methods. They include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "the regulation of hours of work including the establishment of a maximum working day and week, the regulation of the labour supply, the prevention of unemployment, the provision of an adequate living wage, the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the protection of children, young persons and women, provision for old age and injury, protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own, recognition of the principles of equal remuneration for work of equal value, recognition of the principle of freedom of association, the organisation of vocational and technical education and other measures."</PARA>
<PARA>This statement of principle should be read in conjunction with the Declaration of Philadelphia which was adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1944. Amongst other things, the Declaration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"reaffirms the fundamental principles on which the Organisation is based and, in particular, that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I go back to principle (a): labour is not a commodity. They are dead right. Labour is not a commodity. No longer do we live in a country which refers to master and servant. Labour is not a commodity and labour should never be treated as a commodity. Production now is a social process. Yes, it does depend upon people who invest. Yes, it does depend upon boards of directors. Yes, it does depend upon managers, and yes, it does depend upon those people who still work on the factory floor, but labour is not a commodity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems&mdash;and I say this recognising that private property and the institution of private enterprise are fundamental, I suppose, to the system in which we live&mdash;is that the chief motivation of all of those processes continues to be profit. People invest for profit; managers manage for profit. Directors have a responsibility to the shareholders to enlarge profit. Labour is employed to create wealth and to create profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At any given level of production the fact remains that the higher the level of wages, the lower the volume of profit. The more that is spent on certain forms of industrial safety, the lower is the profit. For that reason, the labour movement continues to maintain its vigilance and the objectives that the labour movement set hundreds of years ago. This Australian Labor Party continues to pursue objectives that we were formed to pursue over 100 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We developed the belief over 200 years ago that the market itself would never be adequate to satisfy all of the social concerns about the conditions under which people live and work and, having resolved that, the labour movement established political organisations, political movements, liberal democratic parties, socialist parties and finally won government. I remind all honourable members that the first time in the history of the world that a labour party formed a government was in Queensland. It was the result of a coalition; it was not elected to government. That was not to come about until the Fisher government was elected. That first workers' government in the history of the world in Queensland lasted for six days but the breakthrough was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We continue to pursue those great objectives. That is the reason for our existence. It was the reason for our birth. It is the reason for our continuity. I want to see more of these ILO conventions ratified in Australia. I know that the process is not complete until, first of all, it is identified that all of the states comply with that particular convention. It is also not complete until we are satisfied that that convention is an important one for Australia to pursue. It is not ratified until it complies, as well, with Commonwealth regulations. Because we have ratified only 54 of 175 conventions, does that mean that many of those conventions do not have complying legislation in the states? They are critical questions. I applaud the production of this new edition and I look forward to the continued improvement in this whole area of industrial relations and working conditions, internationally and nationally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think anyone looking at labour relations and industrial conditions around the world cannot deny that, without an organisation of the ilk of the ILO, it would be difficult to know how you were going to advance conditions of people, wherever they might be, in whatever country. It has long been my concern, however, that, like many international fora, I am afraid that the ILO, if you look at its membership, has a few countries whose adherence to what we would all see as reasonable standards of behaviour is a little suspect. I was interested in looking through the membership to see that countries like Zaire, Iran and Iraq are members. While I know that within the Australian workplace there are a good many who are concerned about conditions, fortunately nobody in our society is as badly affected as some in those societies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my first concern is that there has to be a forum by which conditions can be addressed internationally. I am one of those who has long been cynical about the value of the United Nations. Yet I guess much the same could be said of it as of the ILO: that, for all its weaknesses, there is no better way by which you could at least promote an alternative to violent conflict in the resolution of differences between states. I believe that the ILO is a very good basis from which at least you can advance a concept of understanding of what should be reasonable conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in looking up the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Status of ILO conventions in Australia 1994</EMPHASIS>, tabled by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and noting some of the countries in our own region that are members. They are, again, countries where I have quite real concerns about the conditions of those in the work force. The People's Republic of China is one, for example. I looked up some of the particular ILO conventions to which they are not parties and which they have not ratified&mdash;things like guarding of machinery, or hygiene in commerce and offices. They are basics, they are fundamental to human safety and health. Yet, unfortunately, it is not just China&mdash;I am just picking China out&mdash;because I notice that the Philippines has not adhered to them either and, indeed, Singapore has not. So there are many countries which have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of the importance, therefore, of these ILO conventions that I am disappointed that we are talking about this in the Main Committee. Indeed, I have a strong objection to the Main Committee meeting while matters of substance are going on in the House. I really do not believe that, under the last few changes made to our standing orders, the procedures of parliament are given the weight they should be. I find it quite incredible that a member of the other place is under a censure motion at the moment and we are all up here. We are debating something here which is terribly important, but I think it is quite inappropriate that the Main Committee should be deliberating on something that is very important and yet down in the other place something is being done which really involves us all. So I object strongly to the fact that the Main Committee debate is taking place at this time, particularly because it involves something that is of fundamental importance in the wellbeing of the Australian work force and, indeed, of workers everywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The status of ILO conventions is well described by the minister. In the foreword to the report, he comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Status of ILO Conventions in Australia 1994</EMPHASIS> aims to promote a better understanding in the Australian community of the ILO's standard-setting activities and the role that international labour standards play protecting the minimum standards of Australian workers and in the development of employment conditions in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>And, as he continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It reviews Australia's position in relation to each ILO Convention as at December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to come back to some of the remarks which my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) made on the report, but it is important that we do have benchmark standards by which progress in the workplace can be achieved. I really do not see them quite as the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) presents them. My worry is this: I do not see this as a conflict between worker and employer in the true sense of IR of the past. I believe that it is now far more a matter of trying to make sure that there are minimal standards addressed throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Tangney identified, in our nation the plague of separate states and separate regimes continues to exist, and one of the reasons that many of these conventions are not in place is because of the differences that lie between states. There are too many areas where uniformity is too arbitrarily applied but, equally, the reverse also applies so that, while there are some areas where I believe that uniformity is most desirable, I do not believe that you can arbitrarily lay down one standard to apply to everybody. But, in this field of work conditions, I think you should. There are far more areas where it would be better to have the same standard applying throughout the country than there are areas where it would be better to preserve the right to differ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is because of the consequence of ratification that it is particularly important that we note the way by which the ratification procedure takes place. There is, of course, consultation and there is a federal-state ministerial conference, and the practice has been that not only is there a report of these ILO conventions to that federal-state ministerial conference but also there is a ratification process within that conference, which I think is most desirable. I was glad that the honourable member for Tangney took that to the next step of looking at the general application of international conventions. I would like to do much the same and, indeed, I endorse the concern that he has that, for members of parliament&mdash;and for the Australian public as a result&mdash;in most instances we know nothing of what has been agreed by the Australian government until such stage as a report of this character is tabled in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see that as being good enough. I was one of those, at that 1988 convention to which the honourable member for Tangney referred, who did not support the minority report that was presented on behalf of Sir Rupert Hamer and Professor Leslie Zines&mdash;although I think that that was actually in the constitutional commission; it was not a convention. But I have always had reservations about the best formula by which, on the one hand, you can determine the extent to which there needs to be power in the executive&mdash;and, hence, its participation in international conventions&mdash;and, on the other hand, you can ensure that there is public understanding and public endorsement of those conventions; and not just ILO conventions, but the whole spectrum of international agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more that Australia follows those agreements and those agreements or their implications are passed into federal law, there is obviously an implication which requires the executive to report to the wider community. The honourable member for Tangney, in his presentation, talked about the absolute necessity in this ILO field, as in other international areas of negotiation, for the reporting procedure to be put in place and for there to be a ratification. As one of the members of the Menzies ministry, I certainly supported the `Ponsonby rule', as they called it, which required at least the tabling in the parliament of the international agreement before it was ratified. At the least, that process should be followed by the present federal government. I know it has long since fallen into disuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the incredible features of this government has been not only the extent to which it believes it has the arbitrary authority to do what it likes and to negotiate internationally, but also its remoteness and lack of concern for the average citizen of Australia knowing what is going on&mdash;which seems to me to be high-handed and just not acceptable. It applies as much in the field of ILO conventions as anywhere else and, if you have a look at the conventions, there is&mdash;as the honourable member for Charlton so properly said&mdash;concern out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us wants to go back to the conditions to which the honourable member refers. The member for Charlton talked about the coalmining area of the Hunter Valley. I can tell you that, in the bush, exactly the same thing applied. There are far too many people in generations past who did not learn to read and write and far too many of them had to go out and work in the days of their childhood. I tell members of the wider community that, sadly, we are approaching this situation again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that, for other reasons&mdash;this may well be a diversion from ILO conventions&mdash;there is an enormous concern in rural Australia about the consequences of this drought. What is happening is that people are not being educated. I know of children in my part of the world who are no longer going to school. Many of the children are in the category to which the honourable gentleman refers and yet they are, supposedly, covered by ILO conventions. In other words, the minimum standards that should be applicable are not applicable because people cannot afford them. There is nothing worse than to have a youngster come along and say, `I'd like to continue at school but I can't. I've got to go and work,' or to have children's mothers come and tell you why her children have left school. Sadly, that is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standards are essential, but the point that I am trying to get to is that we need to be concerned that the public at large is aware of how we are trying to progress. Whether it is working conditions and ILO conventions or whether it is in any other field, there is an obligation to consult. There is a requirement on the federal government to ensure that conventions which it is proposed to ratify are presented earlier rather than continuing with the present system of providing this annual report to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a quick look at the paper, but it is extraordinarily unlikely that most of the people in the wider community know that only now are we looking at the ratification of the minimum age for fishermen. There are all sorts of conventions&mdash;some of which may well not apply generally&mdash;but `Plantations 1958' is not being pursued. That is quite interesting. I tried to find out what plantations are. The timber industry has been a very important employer about the bush, and one way to develop the timber industry of the future is to have more plantations. However, the paper tells us very little except for information about the work conditions for plantation workers. Whether `plantations' covers timber plantations, I have not a clue, but the point I am making is that, firstly, we learn of all this in bulk, and I do not think that is very desirable; and, secondly, when you do look at the paper you only get a very brief analysis of what it contains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend that, for future occasions, the minister goes back to the Menzies application of the Ponsonby rule, even if he does not go the next step&mdash;as the honourable member for Tangney advocated and which I endorse&mdash;to establish a parliamentary process whereby all international treaties are tabled in the parliament and whereby members of both houses are given the opportunity to debate and, if they so wish, to negate international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that most of the conventions in the labour relations area will have the bipartisan endorsement of members of both houses. However, there are nuances in the conventions and the nuances need to be addressed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing this report, let me say, as all the other speakers have said, that the ILO performs a very valuable and important international and national function. The ILO provides a forum through which those who are concerned about industrial relations and working conditions&mdash;employers, union officials and those concerned to administer various aspects of our industrial law&mdash;can come together to consider these issues not merely on a domestic basis but also on a global basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the concerns that have been outlined by other speakers in terms of the fact that it is not good enough to have important decisions made at the ILO only to have conventions come forward and fall into a parliamentary situation where the process for dealing with them is less than adequate. So often in our parliament we hear terms like `Australia has got to become part of the global market'. Although we are told that privatisation of industry is a desirable way to go, that is not a view that I share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, as tariff barriers fall and despite international conventions, those nations find, both as a matter of history and in the way in which their own economies have evolved, that there is gross exploitation of women and children. Children in many parts of our own region are denied a childhood by virtue of their exploitation in manufacturing processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are Australian manufacturers which employ a large work force. I am thinking of those in the textile and clothing industry which were protected. As the barriers of protection fell, they found the only way they could survive was by opening up manufacturing and production outlets in other parts of Asia. There is no such thing as a stereotyped employer, just as there is no such thing as a stereotyped worker. I know of concerned employers who had successful industries in the clothing and textile industry, who were employing workers under award conditions and who found that, in order to stay in business, they had to retrench large numbers of talented, loyal and dedicated workers and were appalled when they went overseas to see the conditions under which, if they were to set up new industries, people would be employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very suit I am wearing, when I first bought it, was an Australian product. When I tried to buy the same product two years ago, I found it was made in China. The real question is: are the conditions under which it is produced equitable and just? Do we say that we cannot afford to employ Australian workers? If we are going to survive as employers&mdash;and I can understand that&mdash;we have to create our manufacturing opportunities in other parts of the world even though we may abhor and not support the conditions under which those workers are employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see how, given the pressures that are upon the executive and the pressures that are upon individual ministers, given the tensions that occur regularly as between certain states and the Commonwealth on the whole issue of industrial relations, we can give some of these important conventions the consideration that they deserve simply by the process of tabling the report. If we are serious about dealing with these conventions and reports, a case could be made for creating a permanent standing committee which would have the task of considering these reports as they come forward and then reporting to the parliament and the government on those conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process might well mean that there is a focus which does not presently exist. There will be a focus which will bring the attention of the relevant minister and his department to those issues because, if we are serious&mdash;and I take the point that was made by the previous speaker, the member for New England (Mr Sinclair), when he pointed out that while we are debating this there are other things going on in the other chamber&mdash;we must ask ourselves whether our parliamentary processes, which are becoming more complex, and the times and pressures that are on ministers and members, are such that we are doing anything more than paying almost irresponsible lip service in order to say, `Here is an important set of documents and recommendations from an international body. We will honour those by tabling them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have to be considered in the context of the way in which we see our own economy developing and the pressures upon our manufacturers and our work force, our commitment of trying to maintain some level of full employment in this community while making us as a nation competitive in a whole range of areas. Because they are so important it is not good enough simply to say, `Well, we table this report and we hope that people will pick it up.' It is not good enough that these important issues be left basically to the trade union movement, manufacturers and those who are involved heavily in the whole process of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we could advance the situation which all speakers to date have spoken about, with some concern, by this parliament discussing the issues for the purposes of suggesting that we have a parliamentary committee whose function it is to receive these reports, to examine them as a committee on a bipartisan political basis and to report to the parliament. On the basis of each report, matters can then be taken up by ministers and by the parliament in a way which will give these important conventions the kind of attention that they require. That is a view which would go a long way towards solving the levels of dissatisfaction that have been expressed on both sides of this chamber in terms of the lack of effective process in dealing with matters of substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such matters go ultimately to our capacity as a nation not merely to survive in an increasingly competitive world but to survive in a way where we see justice done to all sections of our work force, justice done to our manufacturers and justice done in that region of the world where we know that, even as I am speaking, there is a gross exploitation of children, women and those far less able to defend themselves in their own country. They do not have the mechanisms and the checks and balances that exist in ours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak and to take note that the DIR publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Status of ILO conventions in Australia&mdash;1994</EMPHASIS> is now available. I believe it is a very useful resource for those who are interested in Australia's status with the ILO conventions. I have found the book very interesting, with details on the various conventions, the ILO history and its implementation. The ratification of ILO conventions in Australia has involved major work by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The publication on ILO conventions aims to promote a better understanding in the Australian community of the ILO's standard setting activities, and of the role that international labour standards play in protecting the minimum standards of Australian workers and in the development of employment conditions in Australia. The ILO attaches particular importance to the need to ensure respect for certain fundamental human rights which have bearing on the social, economic and physical wellbeing of working people throughout the world. These include the principle of freedom of association, the right not to be subjected to forced labour and the right to work free of discrimination on the grounds of race, creed, sex and other arbitrary criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are fortunate in Australia that so many of the basic rights, some 54 of the ILO conventions, as well as 922 treaties, have been ratified by Australia. Not all ILO conventions are appropriate targets for ratification by Australia. There are 176 conventions, 54 of which have been ratified and a further 30 of which have been identified by the Commonwealth-state consultative machinery as appropriate targets, and we are working through that machinery at the present time. The remaining conventions have either been closed to ratification by the adoption of a revising convention or have been judged not to be relevant to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential for Australia to have a good record of ratification if we are to speak with authority and standing in the international community on labour and social matters. It would be difficult to criticise the human rights of other countries if Australia's own record was not good. We are still seeking to address certain conventions, including one of child labour, with which there are some problems currently, and which have been highlighted recently in the press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some ILO conventions have been overtaken by change and by time. We have, in fact, only denounced one convention and that is No. 45, which prohibited women from working in underground mines. This convention was adopted in June 1935 and came into force in May 1937. It was ratified by Australia in October 1953 and denounced in May 1988. I think, in equality terms, that is the reason that the ratification has been changed. I guess, if men go into mines, it is accepted that women go into mines; otherwise it would be discriminatory. Anybody who goes into a mine deserves to be protected by other ratifications of international convention and I am trying to point out how these conventions can change over the years. It is appropriate that we have changed that convention and denounced the one that came into being in 1934. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILO states may withdraw from their obligations in respect of ratified ILO conventions during a period of 12 months every 10 years, from the anniversary of the date the convention came into force. During the 1980s, several Australian states repealed their legislation prohibiting women working in underground mines on the basis that it discriminated against women. Australia's rationale for denunciation was that conditions in mines had improved with technology advances, et cetera to the extent that the special protection of women was no longer required. It shows the changes that Australia has been through from 1953 to 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One convention I am particularly interested in is Convention No. 155, Occupational Safety and Health, 1981. This is rated as a suitable target for ratification, which Australia has not undertaken yet. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention provides that each member State shall formulate, implement and periodically review a coherent national policy on occupational safety and health in the working environment. It provides that such a policy shall be formulated after consultation with the most representative organisations of employers and workers. Its objective shall be to prevent accidents and injury to health arising out of, linked with or occurring in, the course of work, by minimising, as far as possible, the causes of hazards inherent in the working environment.</PARA>
<PARA>The convention provides, among other things, that employers are required to supply adequate protective clothing and equipment and to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable, the workplaces, machinery, equipment and processes under their control, as well as chemical, physical and biological agents and substances used in the workplace, are safe and without risk to health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention provides also that workers and their representatives in undertakings shall cooperate in the fulfilment by employers of their obligations. Workers who report hazardous working conditions or cease work when they believe the situation presents an imminent and serious danger to life or health are to be protected from undue consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the ACT have agreed to ratification&mdash;but WA now says that it is conditional on the outcome of consultation with the Commonwealth in relation to implementation of an article. Tasmania, my state, has identified some compliance problems but believes they should be overcome with the new occupational health and safety legislation. New South Wales and the Northern Territory are looking at the issue as well. So I think the ratification of that very important convention will come into play some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard some very interesting comments from my colleague the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Brown) earlier in the tabling of this report, dealing with child labour in mines and going on to link in the importance of some of the conditions that apply still in other countries. We should be very aware of that and we should constantly bring that to the attention of world bodies and endeavour to enforce these conventions or ask that these conventions be ratified throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we did not have conventions or opportunities or mechanisms or machinery such as this through the ILO, I believe that working people throughout the world would be in much worse conditions and have much less opportunity of overcoming the difficulties in which they work. Work should have dignity, it should have conditions of safety, it should have conditions of work and it should have wages paid which allow an individual to live with dignity, and the ILO conventions assist in reaching those goals. There are parts of the world, and some very wealthy countries of the world, where people still work as the working poor. These are issues which I believe will start to confront the world in debate over the next few years. I welcome the report and commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very important that the House does take note of these kinds of issues. The ILO is a very important world body. It is one which has been around for many years, having been established in 1919. It is very important to note that this international body, the ILO, has survived many cataclysmic events that have taken other organisations of lesser standing and stature and swept them aside in the course of history. Indeed, the League of Nations is one such body. That went the way of all irrelevant bureaucracies at a national, local or international level because it did not meet or address the real needs of people and the respect of countries which it sought to serve. Those organisations which are nothing but international talk shops or international conventions where people meet only for the sake of meeting and which achieve very little of real practical purpose are readily identified by people and by countries and are swept into the waste bin of history, and that is often the most appropriate way of dealing with these things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International organisations must evolve and claim a place in society and in the world order in order to justify their repeated renewal and the funds which are placed in their care. Indeed, surrendering the initiatives in these areas to an international organisation is not something which should be done lightly. Nations, quite rightly, jealously guard their sovereignty and try to ensure that it is maintained. Some nations feel threatened by international organisations which they believe can usurp that national authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the case with the ILO. The history of the organisation indicates that that is so. The ILO clearly has a real place in the world. It has a real purpose and its work has real meaning. That it does so in a controversial area like labour relations is of great credit to the organisation and those who work within it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the ILO was established in 1919. It has a substantial number of permanent members. It is unique amongst United Nations organisations in that it is a tripartite body. While only a national government can be a full member of the ILO, it always sends a delegation which consists of two government members and representatives from the peak union or employee bodies and from the peak employer bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, the ILO earns a great deal of respect and credibility throughout the world because it represents all who are involved in the industrial relations equation: the governments of each country&mdash;which are there to protect their national interest as well as to advance world interest; the representatives of the union movement; and the representatives of employer bodies. Thus, over the years, the ILO has been able to address a number of very important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth while looking at the founding principles of the ILO, because they underwrite many of the conventions and recommendations it introduces in the course of its work. The ILO was founded on the principles of social justice. It is worth referring to the initial principles on which the ILO was founded and which are incorporated in the constitution of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILO was set up to include discussion of the following: the regulation of the hours of work, including the establishment of a maximum working day and week; the regulation of the labour supply; the prevention of unemployment; the provision of an adequate living wage; the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment; the protection of children, young persons and women; provision for old age and injury; protection of the interests of workers when employed in countries other than their own; recognition of the principles of equal remuneration for work of equal value; recognition of the principle of freedom of association; the organisation of vocational and technical education; and other measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we examine some of those measures now, we can see how far-sighted the people who established the ILO were in identifying issues which would affect people over the years&mdash;not only in developed countries like our own where many of these matters are still subject to debate and disputation, but particularly in Third World countries where these things are far from as advanced as, fortunately, they are in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), in an earlier contribution, referred to some of the less fortunate countries which are members of the ILO but which do not have the labour standards which we take for granted on both sides of politics in this country. When you look at some of the other issues which those countries are still dealing with in the ILO, you can see why there is an ongoing need for an organisation like the ILO and why it is essential, even in a country like Australia&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension for the division in the House of Representatives I was discussing the basis of the constitution of the ILO, the very important principles on which it was founded and the kinds of issues which it had been formed to take into account even way back in 1919. The importance of these issues has not gone away. While in Australia we may have been fortunate enough to tackle many issues such as child labour and other areas of oppression of the work force in times past, that is not always the case in some other parts of the world and the importance of attacking these issues will continue. There is no question that one can continue to improve these standards wherever they are fixed and there will always be differences around the world which need to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other very important part of the ILO's founding documents&mdash;which were established, in this case, in 1944&mdash;is the statement of principles. The statement of principles also bears reaffirmation, as does the ILO, because the declaration which it passed at that time reaffirmed the fundamental principles on which the organisation is based and, in particular, established that labour is not a commodity. Freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustain progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere and the war against want requires to be carried on with unrelenting vigour within each nation and by continuous and concerted international effort so that the representatives of workers and employers enjoy equal status with governments and join with them in free discussion and democratic decision with a view to promotion of common welfare. Indeed, many of these same principles are of very much importance to us today whether we are in Australia or whether we are in some of the less fortunate countries where the ILO's writ does not run or where it runs but is not properly implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to look at the way in which the principles of the ILO are enforced throughout the world. Firstly, of course, it is important that nations are members of the ILO. If they are&mdash;many are; there are some 175 members of the ILO&mdash;these nations have the opportunity to send people to the various deliberations of the ILO to take part in the formulation of conventions or recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations are very much technical matters where the ILO formulates principles on which it believes member states should act and it fills out the details which are often left out of the conventions. It is certainly the case that, if you look at some of the conventions, they are far from detailed and, indeed, much is left to be discussed in the course of recommendations which the ILO formulates and puts forward for the consideration of member states. Where a member state is prepared to adopt and ratify a convention, then, of course, there are internal processes of law within each country which need to be undertaken by that country. The only obligation which a nation has is to draw to the attention of the relevant authority the various conventions which are adopted by the ILO. In the case of Australia and most other Western and other countries, that authority would be the relevant parliament of the country. The obligation of the state is met if it draws the attention of that parliament to the convention which was adopted by the ILO and which that country has ratified, normally through the force of executive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the executive government in Australia is presumed to have received the common-law rites of the royal prerogative at the time of the establishment of the Federation of Australia, then, of course, the powers of the crown in the United Kingdom&mdash;which enjoyed very substantial powers in the ratification and negotiation of treaties&mdash;are presumed to have devolved on the Commonwealth of Australia as the legal inheritor of these common-law powers from the United Kingdom at the time of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that does, in a modern context, have the potential to create some difficulties in a federated state like Australia. We have an enviable record in the number of conventions which we have adopted compared with many other federal states. Indeed, when you compare us with the countries of this region and with APEC and the like, we have a fairly strong basis for the number of conventions which we have ratified. Although it is not as strong a record as might apply in parts of Europe where those countries have been able to ratify many more conventions, if you look at the general application of the law in this country we have done quite well, although, as this report points out, we could do far more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at the number Australia has ratified so far: 48 out of a total of 172 conventions. Coincidently, this is the same as the number for the Soviet Union, but it compares favourably with the number for other federal countries, such as Canada, 27, Malaysia, 11, and the United States, 10. But, as I said, it is not as impressive a record as countries like France, with 114, Germany, 69, Spain, 122, Sweden, 82, and Great Britain, 80. It is for those reasons that, in 1991, in an attempt to improve on this record, the government established a task force to conduct a detailed review of those conventions which were identified as possible targets for ratification. Part of that process is the paper we are taking note of now, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Status of ILO conventions in Australia 1994</EMPHASIS>, which lists the various conventions which could well be targeted for ratification, examines those, and indicates which are possible targets and which others would have to be neglected because of the simple effluxion of time and the fact that those conventions are now well out of date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that we take into account the federal structure of Australia and the way in which, as with any treaty negotiation, it is important that Australia takes into account the interests of the various states. As a former member of a state parliament and a former state minister, I am only too well aware of the impact which conventions and treaties signed by a national government can have on the states in Australia. Of course, in the case of the ILO, the federal government has, in almost all cases bar one or two, been able to obtain the agreement of almost every state prior to implementing these treaties. This is an enviable record. It is one which I am sure we would want to continue, although in some cases it is not always practical to guarantee that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's international reputation is very important. It is also essential that we show some significant leadership in these areas to demonstrate to other countries in this region that we are prepared to take leadership on the area of international labour reform, the protection of individual rights and the promotion of social justice. Those issues are quite critical and, if one or more of the states stands in the way of that process, inevitably the Commonwealth will be forced at some point to use its powers to ratify and implement those treaties through some of the other heads of constitutional power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should preferably not be through the external affairs power; that is the one of least application in this context, I would think. But we do have many others&mdash;the corporations power and the like, the trade and commerce power, and the incidental power&mdash;which can all be used, with the endorsement of the High Court, to implement these kinds of treaties. Whenever the High Court has tested the matter of these treaties, I think it has come out very much on the side of the Commonwealth's international obligations. Indeed, how can Australia conduct its affairs in the world of national governments these days without being part of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our country is part of an international economy, something we cannot avoid and something which is going to grow with time, and the internationalisation of our economy is something which we must all come to grips with. I think the ILO, through its processes of international normalisation and reform, will play a very vital role in that and I would like to ensure that Australia takes its part in the Asia-Pacific region in promoting those very worthwhile objectives of social justice that the ILO promotes. </PARA>

<PARA>I think it is clear from that that the ILO is a internationally respected organisation that is looking at key issues with respect to the overall wellbeing of the world, and in that respect it is deserving of strong support. The situation has been that there has been strong support for the ILO both within Australia and also internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within Australia we have had a situation where coalition governments have ratified 22 of the 54 conventions ratified by Australia, including several important ones: No. 42, regarding workers compensation; No. 47, the 40-hour week; No. 88, employment service; No. 105, abolition of forced labour; No. 122, employment policy; No. 123, minimum age, underground work; and No. 144, tripartite consultation and international labour standards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a motion in the House of Representatives on 7 December 1994 on the issue of the 75th anniversary of the ILO. That motion received bipartisan support of the House. I would like to quote from the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who spoke on behalf of the opposition in that debate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the ILO has performed a very valuable service and is a very respected organisation in world social and equity terms.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) also spoke in that debate. He raised the issue of several international plaudits that had been received by the ILO. One was on the occasion of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the ILO in 1969. The Chairman of the Nobel Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are few organisations that have succeeded, to the extent that the ILO has succeeded, in translating into action the fundamental moral idea on which it is based. . .

<PARA>His Holiness Pope John Paul II gave an audience to the chairman of the ILO governing body in 1992. He also congratulated the ILO for putting social dialogue and tripartite cooperation at the forefront of its considerations. President Nelson Mandela, in contributing to a volume of essays entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Visions of the Future of Social Justice</EMPHASIS> on the occasion on the ILO's 75th anniversary, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present situation in South Africa, where a majority of the population is trying to rectify the experience of generations of systematic exclusion from the most basic rights and benefits, highlights the ongoing relevance of the ILO mandate. Many South Africans are only now recognising that lasting peace can be established only on the basis of social justice, 75 years after it was expounded as the founding principle of the ILO.</PARA>
<PARA>The circumstances around ILO conventions are to some extent different from some other international treaties. ILO conventions are based on a partnership approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, as I mentioned earlier, a tripartite structure: representatives of employers and workers  have equal voting rights with governments in the various ILO forums. The ILO constitution requires employer and worker representatives to participate in ILO processes. They caucus separately from each other and from governments, and vote according to the agreement of their groups. Australian employers and workers are represented by the peak bodies, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International labour standards are instruments which comprise either conventions, which are open to ratification, or recommendations, which simply provide guidelines to governments. These are adopted by the ILO conference, usually after a double discussion process, whereby the topic is discussed at two successive sessions of the ILO conference. Prior to each ILO conference discussion, the ILO produces a report which analyses responses to a questionnaire. These reports form the basis of discussion. The Australian government responses to questionaries and briefs to delegates, are prepared after consultation with the states and territories, the ACCI and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that a member supports the adoption of a convention at the ILO conference has no impact on the obligations of that member. The decision to ratify is made independently of the vote to adopt. This is a very important issue with respect to our actions on international conventions. Quite often I have had constituents raise with me the fact that we are a signatory to an agreement, or that we have supported some other agreement in an international forum. What that really means with respect to Australian law and to Australian society may be quite different to what is often assumed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about some conventions, we are talking about broad statements of principle which have a certain amount of flexibility within them, in order to take into account the particular conditions which may be faced within a particular member state. In those circumstances, the seriousness of a particular issue may well be overstated by a purely literal reading or literal reporting of what has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, Australian delegations attending the ILO conference comprise government, employer and worker representatives. They work in concert with their own groups. The government delegation includes state or territory representatives, in accordance with an agreed order of attendance. This is funded by the Commonwealth government in recognition of the important role played by state and territory governments in implementing ILO conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous speaker, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), commented, the circumstances of the detail of the convention and how it may work, if adjusted into law, is such that the role of state governments in the implementation process is often crucial. There has to be that involvement from a state and territory basis as well&mdash;that what is in the end ratified and in the end adopted is something which is workable within the various state systems that we have within this federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state or territory minister for labour and the opposition spokespersons on industrial relations are invited to attend the ILO conference for the same time as the Minister for Industrial Relations. Again, this is funded by the Commonwealth. It is usual Australian practice not to ratify an ILO convention unless two conditions are met: firstly, that law and practice in all relevant jurisdictions comply with its provisions; and, secondly, that all relevant state and territory governments have formally agreed to ratification. The caveat of `relevant' is included because some conventions fall within the Commonwealth's jurisdiction alone. There is also a third precondition&mdash;the formal agreement of the ACCI and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILO conference adopted convention No. 176 concerning safety and health in mines in June 1995. As I mentioned earlier, of the 176 ILO conventions, Australia has, at this stage, ratified 54. A further three conventions dealing with employment conditions for seafarers are expected to be ratified soon. Ratification of these conventions is significant in that it will help Australia achieve compliance with convention No. 147 with respect to merchant shipping minimum standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often you can have a situation where a number of conventions have to fit together&mdash;to lock in&mdash;to actually meet the conditions of another convention but, essentially, it is about trying to improve the overall safety net, often in a particular area of conditions with respect to workers as a whole or with respect to a particular industry. Obviously, the merchant marine industry, as an international industry, is a key industry for the ILO to have an interest in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier the question of ILO conventions versus other treaties. The significant aspect of state consultations on ILO conventions compared to other treaties is that it is ongoing. The ILO conference is an annual event and the processes are well established. The requirement of federal member states to consult with their constituent states is unique in the United Nations system, as is the direct involvement of the social partners in the development of international labour standards and the ratification process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of its inquiry into treaties, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee appeared to be impressed by the consultative processes for ILO conventions as described by the Department of Industrial Relations. Senator Ellison, the chair of the committee, and Senator Kemp both suggested that the ILO processes might comprise a model for all treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that overall debate on the question of treaties and external affairs and the way that the government operates with respect to those particular issues, there has been a range of debates. A number of issues were raised by Senator Abetz as a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. Senator Abetz criticised the government for consulting with peak groups rather than constituent groups and individuals within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, in the circumstances of ILO conventions, we are required by the terms of the ILO constitution and convention No. 144 on tripartite consultation to deal with the most representative organisation of employers and workers. The point is often made that the ACTU is not fully representative of the needs and aspirations of workers in this country. The figures on the membership of unions and the particular areas that they actually are involved in with respect to employment within Australia are raised but, again, the question is: if you don't consult with them, who do you consult with? The nature of government, the need to actually involve aspects of the community but at the same time reach decisions over time, requires government to make choices and, in those circumstances, the ACTU certainly is the most appropriate body with respect to employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same circumstances relate to the question of employers. The ACCI, in its own way, is not ideal with respect to this issue but it is, in fact, the best option that is available under the circumstances if you wish to consult with the employer sector about what employers see as being important in terms of any particular conventions that may be under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues were also raised by Senator Abetz regarding, for example, Vietnam as a nation which should pay greater regard to the standards that we employ in Australia. One of the things that the government has tried to do through the ILO is to provide assistance to Vietnam in this regard by helping to translate key ILO conventions into Vietnamese and by assisting with the development of their newly adopted labour code and to improve action on the ILO conventions within that country. I commend the paper to the House. I think it has a lot of valuable information which can be used in the future in the consideration of conventions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks in the context of the tabling of this paper on ILO conventions in Australia relate to the shipping industry, particularly ILO 147. Some members will recall our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report that was tabled in December of 1992 and, in particular, what it said about conditions for crew members. We highlighted the exploitation, impoverishment and straight-out physical abuse that was being perpetrated upon crew members, particularly crew members from Third World countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that report we made a recommendation that the government not permit vessels to enter Australian ports if they could not prove that they were complying with ILO 147. The text of recommendation 11 was that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government deny entry to ships which do not meet ILO 147 standards in relation to crew employment conditions from trading in Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA>The response of the government was to say that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not feasible to assess whether a ship complies with ILO 147 standards prior to inspection&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to port state inspection&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which can only be carried out in port. The present system which provides for detention of non-compliant ships until deficiencies are rectified is therefore considered the most appropriate approach to ensuring that conditions on board ships are not hazardous to safety and/or the health of their crews.</PARA>
<PARA>Our committee carried out a further review of ship safety and the matters relating to crew conditions. It presented to the parliament in November of last year a progress report in which we looked at the responses from government and industry to the recommendations that we had made. We will present a final report to the parliament at the end of the coming November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having looked at the responses of the government, industry, ship operators, ship managers and ship owners, as a committee we remain more convinced than ever that ILO 147 should be ratified by this country and that we should be demanding proof of compliance with ILO 147 before ships are allowed to enter Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told that it was very difficult to ensure that a ship was meeting ILO 147 conditions before the ship came into the port, as I mentioned a few minutes ago. That is not nearly as difficult as it seems or as it is described in those words. There is always the last port state inspection that the vessel has been subjected to. Information is always available on the reputation and standard of management of the ship concerned, and information will increasingly be transmitted from port state inspections around the world through the various port state groupings, particularly the Asia-Pacific port state group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time we have been exchanging information about conditions on board ships and the condition of ships so that when a ship and/or its treatment of crew is substandard that information can be transmitted ahead of the ship's arrival to the appropriate port state inspection group. In Australia's case, that is the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members may wonder why we are so concerned about ILO 147. It is the international convention that protects employment, accommodation and treatment of crews on board ships. Those who have read our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report or have been in any way involved with some of the substandard ships that come into Australian ports will well understand. Twenty countries ratified the principal convention, ILO 147, and it had been declared applicable to 18 non-metropolitan territories. These 38 countries covered 45 per cent of the world shipping gross tonnage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention involves a commitment to safety standards. From our examination of the shipping industry, the conditions, morale, care and accommodation all have a bearing on the crews' ability to carry out their tasks on board ship, the competency with which that vessel is operating and therefore on the safety of the vessel. So the convention involves a commitment to safety standards, social security measures and established shipboard conditions of employment and living conditions. The standards under ILO 147 should be substantially equivalent to the articles that are covered in the detail of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective jurisdiction or control needs to be exercised over home registered vessels&mdash;that is vessels registered under the flag of the nation concerned. There must be adequate procedures for the employment of seafarers. Seafarers must be properly qualified and adequately trained. Maritime labour standards must be enforced, principally by inspection, and there should be an inquiry into any serious marine casualty. Advice should be provided to nationals and states which have ratified the convention on the problems of working on a vessel flagged in a state which has not ratified the convention. Port states may take action to rectify clearly hazardous deficiencies on board and may notify the country of registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 155, which is an adjunct to ILO convention 147, proposes the continued extension of the list of what should be considered minimum labour standards in merchant shipping and improvement in national provisions to reach a standard which is at least equivalent to specified requirements under ILO 147. In response to our recommendations, the government has said, `Whilst we have not ratified ILO 147, we are implementing the spirit of ILO 147 through marine orders via the inspection authority&mdash;the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. So, whilst we have not formally ratified the convention, we are carrying out those tasks we would be carrying out had we ratified the convention.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not accept that that is good enough. The abuse that takes place on some ships coming into Australian ports is incredible. It is something that we were appalled by as a committee. We continue to be appalled by it, and it is something that none of us expected to find. For example, when we looked at the accommodation conditions we found the following: no hot water, one toilet amongst many seafarers, no lighting, water dribbling through the cabins, inadequate food, and crews being starved. One could go on and on about the details of the abuses that take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this scenario, Australia has to be a leader, not a follower. The ships that have these kinds of conditions on board and the nations under which these ships are flagged are well known. We now call them `flags of shame'. The ships of shame are the substandard ships, and the nations which perpetrate these abuses, or which allow these abuses to be perpetrated on ships flying their flags, are flags of shame. The owners of the freight have to accept public responsibility, they have to accept public accountability for the treatment that is being meted out to these crew members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ILO 147 is a good convention. It needs to be ratified. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) said, in response to the report, that the government was implementing the spirit of the convention, but that there had to be agreement among the states. We have not had agreement among all the states. There are three other ILO maritime conventions that we are proposing to ratify on the adoption of a statutory definition of seagoing vessels, which would ensure that their implementation depended on Commonwealth compliance alone. Those three other conventions are: convention 145, `Continuity of Employment (Seafarers)', 1976; convention 146, `Seafarers' Annual Leave with Pay', 1976; and convention 147, `Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards)', 1976&mdash;which is the one I am referring to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough for the industry to go quietly&mdash;and here we are talking about shippers, exporters and importers&mdash;and benefit from these kinds of abuses and for the government to say, `Well, we haven't yet got the states' agreement on all of these matters, but when we do then we could proceed with it.' What we are being advised at the moment is that the Department of Transport is considering a proposal from the Department of Industrial Relations which suggests that the Commonwealth complies with convention 147. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two areas which require examination. Apart from the Commonwealth loan implementation question, the Commonwealth needs to demonstrate compliance or substantial equivalence with one of three social security conventions appended to ILO 147. In light of the amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 made in conjunction with the adoption of the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993, the Department of Industrial Relations suggests that section 127, which addresses shipowners' liability for medical attendants, et cetera, complies with convention 55, which is shipowners' liability for sick and injured seamen. Compliance with conventions 145 and 146 is based on federal industrial awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Labour Consultative Council agreed in March 1988 that ILO maritime conventions should be considered in a tripartite consultative forum in the transport portfolio and the Department of Industrial Relations is asking Transport to initiate consultation with the relevant body. The Maritime Services Advisory Committee has carried out this function in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states and the Northern Territory have been invited to comment on the proposal to ratify these three conventions on the basis of Commonwealth law and practice alone. So far, Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have supported the proposal. Given that the states have agreed to a similar proposal with respect to conventions 69 and 73, we do not anticipate that there will be any concerns raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final position is that, once there is agreement from the social partners and the states and the territories that ratification may take place on the basis of Commonwealth compliance alone, once the Department of Transport agrees that compliance can be demonstrated with ILO convention 147 and once the Department of the Attorney-General certifies compliance, ratification of these three conventions may be possible. It is a long voyage that we are embarked upon. We will be looking at this matter again in the coming weeks as we conclude our review of ship safety. The convention imposes obligations on Australia in relation to loss of life and injury and the conditions under which ship crews work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot said about casualties at sea. I want to tell the committee that safety at sea is the basis of the international convention. There is no systematic recording of data on deaths and injuries. It seems from all of our research&mdash;and that is confirmed abroad&mdash;that the only seamen who appear to be counted are those who go down with their ship. So if you want to be counted in marine casualty statistics around the world then you have to go down to the bottom. If you are injured on board, maimed or hurt on board, there is no mechanism for recording those casualties. That is another major defect in the system. It is all revolving around ILO convention 147. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended in November 1994 that the Commonwealth government take action to ratify ILO convention 147. We still adhere to our earlier recommendation that the government not permit vessels that cannot provide proof of compliance with ILO 147 to enter Australian ports and to enter Australian waters. We feel very strongly about this. I know that the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), as a member of the committee, has very similar views. It is difficult to track down the owners and the managers of vessels. It is difficult in Australia to do other than ensure that before the vessel leaves port it does meet international maritime safety standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give notice that we will be pursuing much more strongly the beneficiaries of those abuses on ships because at the end of the day, they are the people who have to stand up and say, `Yes, we know what is going on. Yes, we use that ship with those abuses on that ship because we get a cheap rate from them.' That is the accountability. That is the responsibility that has to come much more to public notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring that information before the committee because it is a matter about which we as a committee feel very strongly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) Data on persons in subsidised employment at the level of detail sought would take substantial Departmental resources to produce. The following data therefore includes the number of clients who commenced a subsidised employment placement under a labour market program each month since March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TAP data include only those commencements which are subsidised employment. Training courses are also funded under TAP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Caution should be exercised in drawing any conclusions from changes in commencement levels in individual programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1994 general access to JobStart wage subsidy assistance was withdrawn for jobseekers unemployed between 6 and 12 months. This category of participants had represented a substantial proportion of JobStart business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the better than expected employment growth during 1994-95 has had an impact on demand for some labour market programs, with many jobseekers obtaining unsubsidised employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that Working Nation introduced a wider range of employment and training labour market programs in order to meet the needs of individual employers and jobseekers. This has had an impact on commencements in individual programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following data does not include labour market training program commencements. The experience of the last twelve months in implementing Working Nation's Job Compact has been that employers have expressed a strong preference for new employees being `job ready'. Working Nation has responded to this by placing a stronger than anticipated emphasis on training programs rather than subsidised employment programs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that on 17 November 1994 the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) registered the prospectus issued by the Hills Motorway Limited and the Hills Motorway Trust, dated 7 November 1994, in accordance with the section 1020A of the Corporations Law. Section 1020A of the Corporations Law requires the ASC to register a prospectus within 14 days unless it appears that the prospectus does not comply with the Corporations Law, or the ASC forms the opinion that the prospectus contains a false or misleading statement or that there is a material omission. The Attorney-General has no role in the registration of prospectuses and accordingly, I have no detailed knowledge of the Hills Motorway prospectus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) The ASC advises that the NSW's Auditor-General's performance audit of 31 January 1995 has been drawn to its attention and it is of the view that the audit raised no new issues that warranted ASC action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I am advised that the ASC has been provided with the document prepared by R J Tanner entitled Motorway : Hills Motorway Trust, The Hills Motorway Limited, A financial analysis of operations after construction dated 4 April 1995 and has reviewed that report in the context of other reports made available to the ASC. The ASC advises that the analysis of R J Tanner diverged in a number of respects from the projections in the prospectus. I am further advised that the ASC is unable to comment on the likelihood of any particular set of projections being achieved and seeks to satisfy itself, on the basis of its inquiries, that any forecasts or projections would appear to have a reasonable basis. On the basis of the information provided and after consideration of the circumstances in which those reports were obtained, the ASC formed the view that there appeared to be a reasonable basis for the forecasts in the prospectus in relation to traffic volumes and potential rates of return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) I am advised that the ASC conducted inquiries into the projections in the prospectus during the offer period. The ASC has subsequently considered the report of R J Tanner in the light of those earlier inquiries and a number of experts' reports. The ASC advises that it does not attempt to resolve differences between projections made in a prospectus and those made by some other party provided the projections in the prospectus appear to have been made on a reasonable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I am advised that the payment to the traffic expert, Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey Pty Ltd, who provided project design work for the Hills Motorway project, was disclosed in the prospectus. After consideration of the circumstances in which the original report was provided, the circumstances of the payment and other reports known to the directors, I am advised that the ASC decided not to pursue any further action at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) Under the Corporations Law investors have statutory rights of action to recover, for any loss or damage that they may suffer, against persons involved in the preparation of the prospectus, including directors who signed the prospectus and experts who consented to the inclusion of their reports in the prospectus, where statements in the prospectus prove to be false or misleading, or there is a material omission from the prospectus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I am advised that the ASC will continue to monitor the performance of the project in light of the information contained in the prospectus and will take any action considered appropriate, should the circumstances arise. Therefore, I do not propose to direct the ASC to investigate the matter. As stated in my answer to question 4(a), remedies are available to investors under the Corporations Law for loss or damage suffered where statements in a prospectus prove to be false or misleading or there is a material omission from the prospectus.</PARA>
