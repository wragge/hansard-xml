<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In April of this year a delegation of this parliament led by the President of the Senate, Senator Michael Beahan, visited Canada and the United States of America. Apart from myself, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) were the members of this place who were on that delegation. The delegation had a broad threefold purpose: first, to assess the political developments in the United States, in particular since the 1994 congressional elections, which returned a majority to the Republican Party in both the Senate and the House of Representatives; secondly, to promote trade between Australia, the United States and Canada, particularly agricultural trade by Australia&mdash;in that context we were most interested in the progress of the United States Farm Bill through the congress; and, thirdly, to promote Australia as the location for regional headquarters for the United States and Canadian companies operating in Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation visited Ottawa for three days, where we met with many officials, including an almost hour-long meeting with the Rt Hon. Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Hon. Roy MacLaren, the Minister for Trade and the Hon. Raymond Chan, the Secretary of State for the Asia-Pacific. The visit marked the centenary of trading agreements between Australia and Canada. Unfortunately our time in Canada was limited because of parliamentary terms in the three countries and the need to try to visit both Ottawa and Washington while the respective parliaments and congresses were in session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our visit to Washington coincided with one of the most remarkable periods in recent United States history. As honourable members will know, on 8 November 1994 Bill Clinton's presidency suffered a massive blow from a landslide Republican victory in the mid-term congressional elections. The Republican Party regained control in the Senate, which they had last held in 1986, and won a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954. The elections yielded both the first Republican dominated congress in 40 years and the worst performance by the Democratic Party since 1946. Some assessments credited the change to an anti-incumbency mood within the American electorate, but the fact remains that no incumbent Republican lost a seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of reasons for the massive swing against the Democratic Party have been advanced. However, there can be little doubt that President Clinton's administration was also a major factor in the result. As a consequence of these elections President Clinton lost control of the domestic political agenda to the Republicans, with the new Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, quickly moving to fill the policy void by promising to enact his election manifesto, the so-called `Contract with America', in the first hundred days of the new congress, which commenced on 1 January 1995. Key elements of the contract include a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, term limits for federal politicians, large income and capital gains tax cuts, large welfare spending cuts, increased defence spending and a presidential line item veto on all expenditure bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the delegation were in Washington during the last few days of the 100 days legislative program. While most of the contract was passed by the House of Representatives, including legislation to preclude the federal government mandating programs or regulations upon a state without funding, two items were rejected&mdash;namely, the balanced budget amendment and term limits for politicians. While the major part of the contract passed through the House of Representatives, its progress since then has not been guaranteed in the Senate. The final outcome may have a lot to do with jockeying in the American election presidential campaign as much as any other factor. However, it has demonstrated a marked change in American politics over the last two years. As Governor Evan Bayh, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is apparent that there was a tidal wave running across the country and it hit the State House just as it hit the U.S. House. The American people are disenchanted with Governments. They don't want big government, bureaucracy or higher taxes, and they want to see progress towards solving the problems they encounter in their daily lives.</PARA>
<PARA>During our visit, we were honoured to meet with the Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, representative Pat Roberts, the chair of the House Agricultural Committee, and representative Kika Garza, the minority member of the House Agricultural Committee, to talk about progress so far as the farm bill is concerned and to advance Australia's agricultural concerns. We also met with a series of other people in Washington, including members of leading think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, Bill Kristol, the chairman of the Committee for a Republican Future, and Peter Hart, the leading Democratic Party pollster in Washington. The coalition members were also able to attend the Republican conference, the equivalent of our party meeting or caucus, which was addressed by Newt Gingrich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some very brief observations in this limited time. I commend the report to honourable members and members of the Australian public. The first relates to Chicago, where we visited. Chicago, which is in the state of Illinois, is the commercial centre of the mid-west of America. It is one area in which there is greatest trade between Australia and the United States. If one looks at exports to Australia by state, Illinois is second only to California. When you take in surrounding states such as Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana and Minnesota, you see that that part of mid-west America is the centre of the most trade between Australia and the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited the futures market, the Environment Protection Agency, major corporations such as Motorola and McDonald's, and looked with a trade emphasis on Chicago. What surprised us was that Australia only has an honorary consulate at Chicago. Whereas there was previously an office with a staff of 27, Australia's interests in what is probably one of major parts of trading activities between Australia and the rest of the world are represented by one person, an honorary consul. Whilst we are not in any way decrying the activities of the honorary consul&mdash;we were most impressed by the activities of Mrs Joan Miller&mdash;it seemed totally absurd to all members of the delegation that this was the way in which Australia had representation in that part of the world, considering our great interests in it. There is an unanimous recommendation from the delegation that the government look to reopening a full consulate in Chicago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we visited Boston. I want to say something in particular about our visit to Harvard University, where there is a chair in Australian studies. We were interested to hear about two aspects of the chair. The first is whether the funding of the endowment is realistic in light of change in the value of $1 million from when the endowment was made in 1976, and the second is whether the outcomes are consistent with the aims of the endowment. Casual conversations cannot replace a proper inquiry. The delegation noted that the discussions it held at Harvard raised questions about the funding and direction of the Australian studies chair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of promoting awareness and understanding of Australia and the United States of America is worthy, even an essential aim, but can it be maximised with a $1 million capital purse? There seems to be doubt about this and doubts in our mind about the focus of the chair. We have recommended that the Australian government appoint a committee to review the funding administration of the Australian studies chair at Harvard. The review should ensure that the chair remains relevant to the Australian-United States relationship. In that context, I noted recently the establishment of an Australian-New Zealand studies centre at Georgetown University in America. I believe that that ought to be commended as an activity and a focus within the central part of government in America&mdash;namely, Washington. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the remaining moments available to me, I will reflect on the third aspect, which is the relationship between Australia and the United States. In the period since the end of the Second World War, every President from Dwight Eisenhower to George Bush, eight in all, served in the defence forces and therefore, in one way or another, had a connection with and a knowledge of Australia. President Bill Clinton is the first President since the end of the Second World War who does not fulfil that criteria, which in itself reflects a passing of a generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in order to maintain our connection with the United States of America, it is necessary not simply to rely in this 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War on what happened during that war but, indeed, to renew that acquaintance and renew those ties in a very real way. We believe that these delegations every two years are important to do that. We would encourage Americans to come to Australia. We believe that they ought to be led by either the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President of the Senate, giving some sense of the importance that we place on this relationship between Australia and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, may I extend my thanks to a number of people: High Commissioner Murray in Ottawa; Ambassador Russell in Washington; and, particularly, the Congressional Liaison Officer, Bob Tyson, who oversaw our delegation; Honorary Consuls Joan Miller in Chicago, Margaret Stanzler in Boston, and Mr Stephen Brown of Vorys Sater Seymour and Pease who arranged the visits to Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio; and Judy Middlebrook, the assiduous secretary of the delegation. Finally, I extend my thanks to all the members of our very harmonious delegation under the leadership of the President of the Senate. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Woolshed site, Barton, ACT.</PARA>
<PARA>The new building will replace unsatisfactory accommodation, which is currently used by the Department of Industrial Relations, in three separate locations in the city. The new accommodation will enable the DIR to co-locate in an efficient, modern office building which will facilitate improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of the proposed site, blocks 12 and 13, section 9, Barton, will be undertaken in the following manner. The construction of a four storey office building with 12,800 square metres of net lettable area, basement and roof plant rooms. The construction of a three-level structured car park to accommodate 305 vehicles. Included in the car park will be 350 square metres of retail space, including food services. Associated engineering and landscape works will include 197 surface car parking spaces and a plaza, with paving adjacent to the retail area. The building will be designed to provide safe and suitable facilities and accommodation for the Department of Industrial Relations. It will result in the rationalisation of the department's functions in one building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outturn cost of the project is $38.822 million and is inclusive of base building fit out and structured car park fees, holding costs, contingencies and escalation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is sad to see the ANL Sale Bill 1995 come before the parliament. Along with my colleagues the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), I am very reluctant to support such a bill because of the ramifications it has for shipping. It is sad to think that we will lose ANL, our national line. There is a good position for supporting the reconstruction of ANL, to throw off the old cast and build a new sleek, efficient and fast service which would serve Australia and Australian business in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions have agreed to this course of action. They have also agreed to put forward new ideas and concentrate on the routes that are important to us and can make money for us and drop those that are no longer economically viable in terms of competing with other lines. When you look at those lines and the ships of shame you come to realise how bad those lines are and find that it is the lowest common denominator that is driving the price of shipping throughout the world today. There are some shipping companies that strive for decent ships and there are those which make it very hard for the good ones to go forward and make a profit, and this is due to the quality of these ships of shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes me unhappy, as did the legislation relating to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. We are selling off the assets which are part of people's heritage. My electorate takes in the west coast of Tasmania. That is the area King O'Malley represented in the early parliament of our country. King O'Malley fought for and put together the Commonwealth Bank. It was very sad for me to see that bill go through the parliament. It is very interesting that King O'Malley was a teetotaller and yet spoke in many places&mdash;including the balcony of Hunters Hotel in Main Street, Queenstown. The only plaque that I can find of him is on Hunters Hotel in Queenstown. I spoke to representatives of the Commonwealth Bank some years ago about having a statue of King O'Malley erected. They did not seem to be overly interested in giving their founding father the recognition I felt he deserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working people of Australia have invested their assets in ANL and the Commonwealth Bank. These are the assets of the working people of our country. ANL is part of that. I have always been concerned that not enough of our export commodities&mdash;and we are an exporting nation; we have exported since nationhood&mdash;have been carried in Australian owned ships. We have only carried two or three per cent of those commodities out of Australia in Australian owned ships. This has to have a major effect on our economy and our trade figures. All the other business that is associated with foreign ships taking away our commodities&mdash;that is, the associated insurance and so on&mdash;must go against Australia's trade figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation we should be building ships. That should be very high on our agenda. I think it is a shame for the capital  markets of Australia that they have not been able to build up a major shipbuilding industry for our country. When you look at what we have done with the commodities we export such as coal, wheat and wool, it is shame that we lack a shipbuilding industry. I certainly hope things will emerge in future which will help this situation. I do not think selling ANL is the right way of achieving that goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A considerable amount of work has been done into the development of new breeds of ships that can do 60 to 80 knots. If this becomes a reality in the future, it would transform shipping. These are concepts and ideas at the moment that I know people are looking at. But that sort of shipping would certainly compete with air transport in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Tasmania we have had Incat develop the fast catamaran industry into a very successful exporter. In some areas those ships work very efficiently. The industry has added greatly to the economy of southern Tasmania. The government has been able to assist Incat in its training programs through Working Nation being utilised in that area. We have been able to put people into training positions at Incat, which is very positive not only for those individuals but also for that company's future. There is nothing so gratifying than to see people who have been out of work for three years ending up in a training position where they will learn new skills such as aluminium welding, which is on the edge of new technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania we also have new emerging industries in horticulture, with many innovations taking place. We certainly rely on having shipping from our shores not only to reach the markets of Melbourne and Sydney with our fresh produce but also to link into the overseas transport infrastructure that will take our goods overseas and into the emerging markets of Asia. It is very important to the Tasmanian economy that we have efficient shipping and transport services from our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> By not having our own ships, goods are at the whim of the international shipping market. We also have no window to see what is happening in international shipping and our national interest is lost. Any influence that Australia could have on change is also lost. By selling ANL we lose the opportunity of having that window into the world of international shipping, which I think is a great shame. The Japanese are very good at having an integrated system in their businesses. I have seen the way that the Japanese system operates in both the meat industry and the coal industry in Australia. The Japanese buy into a variety of areas so that they know exactly where the costs are and what the industries are about. By not having ANL in this country, we are going exactly the other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Australia we should set a high standard in our shipping. We should not accept the ships of shame as being the norm for international shipping. There are many problems when these flags of convenience countries&mdash;flags of shame, I call them&mdash;are setting some of the standards which are driving international shipping. We should not accept that. I have no hesitation in saying that Australia should be a leader with the standards that we set in shipping. We should not put up with shortcomings, particularly in safety, in a shipping company's mode of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is about having a shipping line which is owned by Australia, employing Australians and having the highest standard of safety and efficiency, and being responsible to one's shipping line's flag and to one's country, so we have the conditions applying that are the normal conditions in the Australian work force. It can be seen as being the Australian way in the ports around the world. It means a lot to Australia, with a strong maritime history of hundreds of years. By selling ANL, we are selling a great part of our history. If the maritime unions and the ACTU and P&amp;O are unable to reach agreement on Australian conditions of employment and employment of Australian crews cannot take place, the bill will not go any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish the negotiations well. But I am very sad that we are going down this track and not a restructuring track. If the talks fail, hopefully we will be able to restructure ANL to make it the Australian national line once again. That could be done under new circumstances when, heading towards the year 2000, a lot of people of goodwill will be working towards an Australian line. It is with some deprecation that I am here. I will support the passage of the bill through the parliament. As I said, I hope the talks go well. However, if they fail we will be endeavouring to restructure ANL. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday we heard some interesting debate from the Labor Party dissidents. We heard from Colin Hollis, who put out a press release in these terms&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their correct titles. I believe you are referring to the member for Throsby. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Mrs BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed he is. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) put out a press release yesterday saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am opposed to the Bill&mdash;I do not support what the Government is doing. It is wrong for us as a Party&mdash;it is wrong for shipping&mdash;it is wrong for Australians&mdash;and one day people will recognise this.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how the member for Throsby expects the Australian people to be convinced by his arguments when he declines the opportunity to cross the floor and vote with the opposition. Indeed, these are the tactics the Labor Party has with many of its members. They feel disenfranchised and disillusioned by the Labor Party and are trying to hold themselves out as being independents in their own electorates when they are really the Keating candidates&mdash;the Keating members without whom the Prime Minister, the member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), cannot be in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is most disappointing to see that the member for Throsby simply did not have the courage of his convictions to cross the floor when he had the opportunity. We provided that opportunity to the member specifically so that he could show his credentials were good and honest. He said that this was wrong in his belief, that he did not support the bill and that he did not support the government, but he did not have the courage of his convictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, like all other Labor Party members who say that they are independents fighting for their electorate, when they get an opportunity to make their point by crossing the floor to give credence and evidence to what they say, they fail. Why is that? Is it because the Prime Minister of the day excites such fear and loathing among his colleagues that they fear that, if they cross the floor and give true expression to what they say, they will be expelled? That is the point. Under the Labor Party regime, they are totally and utterly unable to represent the interests of their own constituencies because they are not afforded the right to cross the floor when they believe in something with such passion. The member for Throsby obviously felt so strongly about it yesterday during his speech that he put out a press release which further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hollis defended the former ANL board sacked by his Ministerial colleague, Laurie Brereton, saying that the Board had never received a fair go, commitments made to them were never honoured, they had been undermined and expected to perform with one hand tied behind their back.</PARA>
<PARA>We are hearing plenty about exactly that in the current Senate hearings. We also heard from Mr Sedgwick, the head of the Department of Finance, who admitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding is that each of the cabinet decisions which were relevant here were communicated to ANL, including the decision to sell 100 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to reply to the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did you, in fact, properly inform the board of the change of the sale arrangements from 49 per cent to 100 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Because Mr Bolitho gave evidence, in fact, that they were not told that the information was leaked. Yesterday, I quoted from that cabinet minute and I dealt with the question of whether or not the minister had acted within the authority of that cabinet minute&mdash;a point that the ASC is duty bound to inquire into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I did yesterday was to seek reassurances from the government on four undertakings relating to the nature and the structure of the bill, particularly the $15 million appropriation, the real purpose of which is not disclosed by the legislation. The manner in which the bill is constructed can allow for secret payments to be made which could include secret payments to the trade unions which would never be disclosed to this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not acceptable to have legislation come before this parliament whereby we appropriate money and are never able to tell exactly the manner in which it is expended because of the way the legislation is framed. For all those reasons, we have voted against the bill on the second reading and will pursue these matters in the Senate. But I would again ask the government to answer my request for the four undertakings as set out in my speech during the second reading debate yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up the time of the House in the consideration in detail of the ANL Sale Bill. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) is correct in what she said&mdash;I do feel passionate about this. What is wrong with feeling passionately about something?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought very carefully about not crossing the floor, because what the opposition is promising is even worse. What the government is doing is bad enough. If the opposition were just going to vote against the sale of ANL and its restructure, you would have had me over there this morning. But look at the opposition's track record&mdash;its constant abuse of the Maritime Union of Australia and its constant undermining of ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk about what I said in my press release and in my speech during the second reading debate. Ever since I have been in this House, I have had a track record in that 12 years of supporting the Maritime Union of Australia, supporting their restructuring and, indeed, supporting ANL. As the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) said, I do believe that we should have a viable shipbuilding industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that we maintain the ANL, an Australian flag carrier and Australian crewed shipping. So let us not hear any more of this hypocrisy. If you people are serious and you want to maintain public ownership of ANL and support the Maritime Union, I will be with you&mdash;and I will cross the floor on it. But don't give me any more cant and hypocrisy about what you are going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Don't worry about me calling myself a Keating member.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a very interesting debate on the ANL Sale Bill. We have seen a large number of members opposite, including the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams)&mdash;and no doubt many other members of the government&mdash;totally opposed to what has been happening in respect of the sale of ANL.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, of course, are opposed to the way in which the government is seeking to use the parliament as a sausage machine to pump this legislation through prior to the election, obviously with a view to dampening down continued unhappiness in its ranks. We are in favour of privatisation of ANL. We believe that a private organisation could operate such an Australian line competitively and efficiently in such a way that it has a chance of succeeding. But since 1991 the government has announced that it will sell ANL. In that time it was absolutely not disputed that ANL had a net worth of at least $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, since the minister's infamous comments in August 1994 when he said, basically, `You couldn't give it away,' we have found a massive devaluation in the value of ANL, and we now find that the remnant assets of ANL will be sold for a mere $19.5 million. The government has basically had its cake taken away from it, so there will not be anything at all left to eat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, those members of the government who believe in the traditional Labor principles of government enterprise will have one of their icons taken from them, one of their icons will disappear; ANL will no longer be in public ownership. On the other hand, because of the way the minister has talked down the company, the marketplace has decided that ANL is worth almost nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that this bill includes two appropriations, one whereby a massive amount of $15 million will be put into the pot as an inducement to ensure that P&amp;O goes ahead with the purchase, and another unspecified appropriation which will last for a period of about 12 months. Although this government has announced, for four or five years successively, that ANL will be sold, there has been massive opposition in the government ranks. Yet we find, at the end of the day, that all the government will be able to get from the remnant assets is the amount of $19.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) is an absolute disgrace. He has failed this nation in a number of areas. In the industrial relations area he brought in a bill which has done absolutely nothing to reduce the massively high unemployment levels. The bill has been so flawed that he has had to come into the parliament on many occasions to try to fix it up. This minister has indicated his incompetence, and his comments of August 1994 when he effectively reduced the value of ANL to $19.5 million indicate he is responsible for reducing the amount of money that the government will receive from the sale of ANL to P&amp;O, if indeed that particular sale goes ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) mentioned, we heard the honourable member for Throsby say that he is totally opposed to what the government has been saying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I give the honourable member for Throsby the benefit of at least standing up and being prepared to say what his convictions are, but of course there is only one time when those convictions count, and that is when the bill is voted on here in the House of Representatives. The people of Australia, the so-called true believers in your electorate of Throsby, were in fact watching you, they were in fact watching the honourable member for Charlton and they were also watching other government members opposed to the sale of ANL because they wanted to know whether you were going to put your money where your mouth is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Throsby has put out a very impressive media release, from which I will quote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to clarify my position in connection with this question as well. During my contribution to the ANL Sale Bill yesterday, I made it clear that I did not support and would not endorse the sale of ANL, and this morning I voted for the government's legislation. Let me make it perfectly clear that I did that because I accept the discipline of the caucus, I accept the nature of collective decisions which are made by political parties, and I believe it perfectly appropriate and absolutely necessary to our system of government for there to be discipline within parties, governments and opposition&mdash;and between them&mdash;and that that discipline, integrity, honesty and loyalty be maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make mention of an observation that was made by the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) during his five-minute contribution at the consideration in detail stage. He made the claim that an off-the-cuff comment by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) was responsible for what he claimed was a reduction in the market value of ANL, from a net worth of $100 million to its present sale price of something marginally in excess of $19 million. I do not believe in the member's more dispassionate moments that he would make that claim. It is a clever statement, but it is not a credible statement. To suggest that the private sector, to which the honourable member would aver some degree of allegiance, and the value assessors within the private sector are so stupid as to write down the value of ANL from something like $100 million to $19 million simply because of a simple off-the-cuff comment by the Minister for Transport seriously offends the competence and the judgment of people who are required to make such valuations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have emphasised previously that a whole series of quite clear problems and disadvantages will accompany the sale of ANL. What I want to emphasise in connection with that general issue is that, unless certain conditions are satisfied by the end of October, the sale will not proceed. It will remain as ANL and will undergo the option of restructuring. In my mind the prospect remains very strong indeed that, as a result of those provisions, there will be an opportunity for Australia to retain its own shipping line, for Australia to expand significantly the freight in and out of Australia which is carried by Australian flag vessels. We will not become a captive of foreign shipping lines, including the ships of shame, as a result of that or as a result of taking into consideration those international shipping conferences which bear so heavily on the important elements that influence Australia's trading capacity as one of the major commercial trading nations of the world and, unfortunately, one of the very minor maritime nations of the world. </PARA>

It could well be that, as a result of these changes now, maritime involvement by Australia may become negligible. I hope not. For as long as we can see into the future, Australia will continue to be a major international commercial trading nation, and we need to be able to back that up with infrastructure that we own and control to ensure that the benefits to Australia are maximised.

It is an absolute disgrace for you to say that. Did you think I would come into this House, sit on your side and vote with you under the camouflage that I was in fact voting against privatisation? You know that you want to privatise ANL. You would not know a seafarer or a wharfie from a real estate agent or a mobile phone. My grandfather was a seafarer back in the early 1900s. He travelled the seas, was a first-class fireman and worked beneath deck, where it was nice and hot and life was rugged.

Look at the Maritime Union of Australia. No union in Australia has undergone more restructuring. Look at the shipping levels, the crewing on shipping. It has gone from 40 down to 18. Did you know that? Have you ever made a speech about that? Have you ever congratulated the Maritime Union of Australia for its multiskilling, for its training? That is one of the reasons I have opposed this. I want a well trained shipping movement around Australia. I want seafarers working those ships to be multiskilled, well trained and well paid.

People are being physically and sexually abused. Is that what you want on the Australian coastline?&mdash;because by voting to nationalise ANL that is what you are going to get. That is why I am so opposed to what my party is doing.

There are a few issues that the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) raised on the actual bill that I want to refer to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that was raised was in relation to the purpose of the $15 million appropriation. It is important to set the record straight on a couple of the points that were made both in the debate and in the press release the shadow minister issued. I should make it clear that the $15 million appropriation represents contingency planning in relation to certain terms and conditions of the sale bill. It does not represent government expectation. That appropriation may never be called upon or may be called upon to a limited extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the appropriations are set out in broad terms on page 3 of the explanatory memorandum, which has already been circulated. I will go through those briefly for the information of the House. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is in relation to the contingency that relevant financiers may exercise change of ownership rights which would impose additional payments on the Commonwealth (all relevant financiers have indicated their consents in principle to the change of ownership). The second element is to provide for the possibility that ANL's operating results up to settlement of the sale agreement are significantly worse than current forecasts. The third is to cover any expenses related to the movement of the transferring items out of ANL.</PARA>
<PARA>All sorts of absurd assertions have been made about this amount. They have no basis whatever in relation to the bill that is before the House. It is not possible to be more specific here without running into questions of commercial sensitivity. However, further briefing on the appropriation and on any other issues which may be of concern to the coalition has indeed been offered to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should make it clear that many of these matters have already been the subject of discussion in the Senate committee on this issue. So attempts here to derail the matter in this sort of fashion do not do any credit to the opposition, who are showing on this issue&mdash;as they did in relation to airlines&mdash;that they act without any regard to principle in the matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriations will not be used for other purposes and certainly not for the sorts of purposes that the shadow minister speculated on. The sale legislation does not contemplate a transfer of shares in ANL to parties other than the Commonwealth or P&amp;O. This is indeed not a possibility. Regarding the unspecified appropriation in relation to RetainCo, the government has undertaken to move an amendment in the Senate to cap the appropriation at $1 million. This should meet the concerns that have been expressed in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister has raised the possibility of tabling the draft and the final sale agreement with commercial-in-confidence clauses deleted. The sale agreement is a fully commercial agreement and with such clauses deleted there would be little left to table. It is therefore not appropriate to table that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a deal of discussion on the merits of the legislation and attempts at cheap political point scoring on the part of the opposition in this matter. It has nothing to do with the substance of the bill. It is a matter of great regret that, when key matters come before the parliament, the opposition uses the sorts of tactics that it used earlier in the week in aviation industry legislation and that it is unable to take the appropriate steps with what has supposedly been policy it sees as appropriate and on which it has articulated the government was not moving fast enough in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has outlined in the sale bill a clear process as to its intentions for that sale and the alternatives if those agreements cannot be put in place by the dates that were identified and if the restructuring process that needs to be contemplated as part of that alternative cannot be completed. There is absolutely no value in the opposition's adopting this sort of tactic of seeking to derail. The government has made its intentions clear. The sorts of scares that have been run and the sorts of lines that have been run have no basis in fact and I believe that, rather than this sort of tactic of using time unnecessarily, the bill should be supported. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The parliamentary secretary has said that the $15 million is to be used for contingency liabilities&mdash;that is, firstly, to be used for non-specific, more specified, contingencies that may arise from the sale; secondly, that the results of ANL are worse than anticipated; and, thirdly, to facilitate the transfer costs, including legal fees.

<PARA>We will never see that sale agreement. We will never know whether, in the government's words, it will not be used for purposes other than the sale and, indeed, how that is interpreted to be used. We are not allowed to see the sale agreement. That is exactly why I asked for the undertaking to see both the draft agreement and the agreement that is finally agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That $15 million does not belong to the government; it belongs to the taxpayers. Here is government putting in place a piece of legislation that gives them carte blanche to spend $15 million of taxpayers' money in any way they see fit. If they were to make a transfer by way of a premium payment in accordance with a sale agreement term to the Maritime Union, then you would never know about it. That money would be virtually a secret commission and we would never know. If they chose to make a payment for another reason that was simply made a term of the sale agreement, we would never know. In other words, accountability is just not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is part of our responsibility as members of parliament to ensure that there is accountability when we appropriate money. In this particular piece of legislation there is none. When I wrote to the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) asking for the delay of this debate because we wanted more time to look for information, he wrote to me and said, as the parliamentary secretary has said, that with regard to the unspecified, second appropriation there will be a cap of $1 million placed on that. But it is the $15 million appropriation that concerns me most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is Minister Beazley who has carriage of the bill, although all the negotiations, planning, intervention and so on were done by the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton. Minister Beazley has written to me in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the $15 million appropriation and any other issues which may be of concern, I undertake to have officers of my department provide you with whatever briefing you require.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not require a briefing. I require an undertaking from the government as to the manner in which the money is to be spent. Then I require a mechanism for evidencing that that undertaking is agreed to because, quite frankly, the word of the government is only as good as its track record&mdash;and its track record is appalling. The word of the government has been broken again and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the parliamentary secretary to stand and say that we will not use it for other purposes, implying that it will be applied only to the precise sale of all shares to P&amp;O&mdash;which the legislation does not provide for&mdash;simply is not good enough. We need evidence and we are entitled to see the terms of that sale. By all means remove the commercial-in-confidence material, but we are entitled to see what those provisions are. We are entitled to have an undertaking that the government will advise the parliament if there is a transfer of shares to anybody else but P&amp;O or a government entity. I would be interested to hear a response on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that, as legislators, we have a responsibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) said that I did not want a briefing. I had a briefing previously from the task force. It included a person in attendance from the minister's office. We went through these matters, which did not satisfy the queries. I raised these matters in my speech at the second reading stage. I raised them in my letter to the minister asking for a deferral and I specifically asked for undertakings because a briefing does not satisfy the requirement that we who legislate have an obligation to ensure there is transparency in the expenditure of public money. The member for Charlton and I both, as former members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, would be very much aware of that. I say to the member, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there were times in that Public Accounts Committee when both sides of the parliament&mdash;Liberal and Labor&mdash;would come together because there was a matter that went to the very heart of the integrity of the parliamentary process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those moments are unknown to the electorate. They are very important moments. We conducted an inquiry into the Midford Paramount case and we finally got justice because we were committed to the purpose of seeing an individual who had suffered at the hands of the bureaucracy get some justice&mdash;four years too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point here is that those vague purposes that the government has laid out for the $15 million simply will not wash. If you talk to all the players and would-be players in this game, there are no satisfactory answers as to why that $15 million is necessary. The most serious aspect is that, because of the way the current legislation is structured, members of parliament and the public will not know how that money has been dealt with. That is just unacceptable in a piece of legislation before this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we voted against this legislation&mdash;as I gave notice to the minister that we would&mdash;it was because these matters were outstanding and there was not enough time for information to be canvassed so that there can be transparency and accountability in this whole process. In coming to that conclusion, we had to look at the track record of the government in this matter: the behaviour of the minister and the general credibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other ministers in undertakings that they had given previously in this and other places and that were then reversed. Dare I say that the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the Federal Airports Corporation are all examples of where undertakings have been given by the government that these entities would never be privatised. In the very prospectus for the Commonwealth Bank we had an undertaking from the Treasurer of the day that there would be no further sale of the Commonwealth Bank: that the 50.4 per cent would remain in public ownership. Members of the caucus were told about it just before the sale was announced in the budget in May. Members of cabinet were only told at 6.30 p.m. before the announcement was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, when I say that I want some guidelines and I want evidence of the way in which that money is expended, I do so because I cannot rely on the word of the government and I cannot rely on the word of the minister and, very simply, nor can the people of Australia. This is a matter that goes to the very heart of the job of the legislature. The member for Charlton's responsibility in this matter is just as great as mine because we are here first and foremost, under the constitution, to pass laws for the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia. That is our task. In reality, if this sale goes through it depends upon the concurrence of the trade unions involved. If the trade unions do not agree, the sale will not go forward. </PARA>

He spoke passionately about the people that he wants to defend, but he did not have the courage to cross the floor. I come back to this point. There was an agreement for the settlement of a union dispute in September 1994 which provided for the unions to have a consortium to buy all or part of ANL. Part and parcel of the agreement for the sale to P&amp;O depends on the unions' concurrence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is part of a package of two bills which will replace the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). That original bill was passed by the House on 31 May but divided by the Senate into two bills on 9 June. A message was received from the Senate seeking the House's concurrence in its action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the original legislation was introduced, a number of minor amendments have become necessary. Rather than pressing on with the original legislation, the government has decided to introduce these new bills to better integrate some related measures and incorporate other minor amendments to the portfolio's legislation. I shall mention these new matters as I outline for members' benefit the key provisions of the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992. The bill repeals the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974, which has become redundant due to a sunset provision which prevented further payments being made after 30 June 1992. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to a number of acts as set out in schedule 2 of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 will strengthen the original intention of the act and clarify and facilitate certain procedural aspects of the child-care cash rebate scheme.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first group of amendments provides hardship provisions to assist certain groups of persons who are currently precluded from receiving the rebate but who should be entitled to the rebate. These groups are children over the age of 13 years who have a disability or other specified special need which requires ongoing child care; parents who should be considered to have work related commitments, such as those who are eligible for, but not in receipt of, a carer pension; and families in which one parent has a work related commitment but the other parent is unable to work or look after their children due to extenuating circumstances such as a medical condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment is sought to allow carers under the age of 18 years who have specified formal child-care qualifications to register under the scheme. Further amendments are proposed to confirm in legislation that family registration is able to be backdated to the date at which the family was first eligible to register, and that the rebate can be paid when a child is absent from child care for specified reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some administrative amendments proposed to rectify a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen. These amendments also make consequential amendments to the act to bring it in line with changes to other Commonwealth legislation. Other administrative amendments are proposed to:</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">allow the Health Insurance Commission to backdate carer registrations to the date at which they were first eligible to register;</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">cancel family or carer registrations and recover payments when an administrative error has been made;</PARA>

<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">allow the minister to have some discretion over receipting requirements; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to remove technical defects in the original act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been changed to include two new minor technical amendments to allow the Health Insurance Commission to vary a family's registration if it believes a member of the family who is not included in the registration should be included, and cancel a family's registration where incorrect information is provided in connection with an application to vary the registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are designed to correct a number of minor drafting errors in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 which established the professional services review scheme. In addition, the amendments will allow the appointment, as a President of a Professional Services Review Tribunal, of a person who holds or has held judicial office in a state or territory jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the new measures in this bill is to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. The proposed amendment would expressly give the Health Insurance Commission the function of providing information technology services to the Commonwealth and to other bodies established by laws of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that the expertise which the Health Insurance Commission has now or will acquire in the future can be made available to perform services for Commonwealth departments or other bodies established by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possibility of utilising the commission's spare capacity and expertise is consistent with the recommended approach of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth agencies rationalising their existing information technology functions. This was foreshadowed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clients first</EMPHASIS>, the report of the Minister for Finance's Information Technology Review Group which was published in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 are designed to correct a deficiency in the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That act, which gave the Health Insurance Commission the power to investigate fraud under Medicare and to deal directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions, does not allow the Health Insurance Commission to retain evidential material seized under the authority of a search warrant for more than 60 days unless proceedings for an offence to which that material may afford evidence is instituted within that period. This deficiency will be corrected on the basis of advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions that without the amendment the commission's search warrant powers are ineffectual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also empowers the Health Insurance Commission to engage in hedging of investment transactions, provide consulting, management and related services and exercise its powers and perform its functions overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission has undertaken a number of consultancies primarily, but not exclusively, under the auspices of the World Bank. As these activities are expanding, and moving beyond the use of spare capacity in the commission's operations, it is desirable to make explicit provision to cover this activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the proposed hedging power is concerned, this is consistent with other Commonwealth legislation and has been addressed, on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, to resolve any doubt about the commission's ability to enter into hedging transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hedging is, of course, one of the tools necessary in a prudent and balanced investment program which includes some overseas investments. The commission operates Medibank Private in competition with other private insurers and must have available to it the same opportunities to manage the funds vested in it by its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also contains amendments to parts of the National Health Act 1953 which regulate the administration of nursing homes. The government has decided that these amendments should not await the introduction of the new Aged Care Act. The amendments to the current legislation are essential to address two immediate issues that have been identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there are a number of technical amendments to the National Health Act 1953 (the principal act) consequential upon amendments to the principal act introduced by the National Health Amendment Act 1992 which resulted in the entitlement to general care benefit being calculated by reference to the `notional scale of fees' determined retrospectively under the principal act in place of the scale of fees determined prospectively under section 40AA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the principal act requires amendment to ensure that nursing home proprietors have a right of review of authorisations of payments of advance of benefit prior to the determination of the notional scale of fees within three years of the relevant accounting period. Secondly, there are a number of amendments that relate to nursing homes which have been granted `exempt bed status'. The amendments contained in the bill will address public concern about exempt nursing homes which fail to meet required standards of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The granting of `exempt bed status' under section 39AB of the act enables a proprietor to charge additional fees to nursing home patients. One of the criteria for granting `exempt bed status' is that the nursing home provides a higher level of accommodation and services than are normally available. However, the current provisions of the act do not enable the revocation or suspension of `exempt bed status' for those nursing homes which have failed to satisfy the standards for nursing and personal care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clearly incongruous to continue to allow a nursing home to charge additional amounts for a supposed increased level of accommodation and services, when the level of nursing and personal care fails to meet the basic standards. The decision to suspend or revoke `exempt bed status' is to be subject to internal review, as well as review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment to the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 is to specify directly the health ministers to be consulted by the minister before appointing the chairperson of the council, the chairperson of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a principal committee of the council, and the member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee classified as a person with knowledge of the ethics of medical research. Currently the act provides that the minister is to consult in relation to these appointments with the other members of the Australian Health Ministers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The composition of that membership can of course vary from time to time and currently includes the New Zealand minister for health. The proposed amendment would specify that it is the health minister of each state and territory who is to be consulted in relation to the appointments. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill incorporates and reintroduces all the provisions of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 in regard to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, as considered by both houses of parliament last session, and differs from that bill in the addition of one further minor amendment to correct an unintended consequence of a clause in the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As outlined in my second reading speech for the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995, the amendments included in this bill will establish a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, ARTG, to cut product approval time to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality or safety of the medicinal products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides a much better definition of some poorly understood aspects of the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods, which have been identified in its first four years of operation. A mechanism to address shortages, or lack of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations, has been included, along with amendments that update and consolidate in a new part of the act, the entry, search and warrant powers to enforce the legislation. Also included in the bill are changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the `penalty units' classification used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation, as well as closing a gap in the current scheme, in regard to the removal of illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality safety and efficacy from the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A definition for `food' has been inserted to clarify the interface between food and drugs. Problems have arisen from the present definition of `therapeutic goods' which excludes `food' but fails to define the term. What constitutes `food' in the bill will be linked to the presentation and promotion of a product in the market. The words `prescribed dose' and `frequency of administration' included in the definition are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments in the bill include a provision to replace the therapeutic goods administration trust account with the therapeutic goods administration reserve, consistent with changes to be made by the proposed Financial Management Accountability Bill 1995 and related bills that will replace the Audit Act 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This will ensure that technical and scientific data that should be lodged in connection with a general marketing application will be evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the new provision in the bill, the legislation currently provides that where therapeutic goods are refused marketing approval within Australia they may still be included in the ARTG as listed goods for export only. The secretary is empowered to require confirmation that the relevant authority of the country to which the goods are to be exported is willing to accept the goods.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this morning to respond to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) to the human services and health and therapeutic goods bills. As second reading speeches go, it went. And it went rather more quickly than the second reading speech for mark I of these bills when debated in the Main Committee on 31 May. Then a pair of relatively minor bills were dignified by a second reading speech that the parliamentary secretary&mdash;a man not known for his use of superfluous words&mdash;held forth for no less than his allotted time plus a 10-minute extension. I understand that he has since taken the Department of Human Services and Health to task for this, and rightly so, as the time of the parliament is now so scarce that the government tells us that every spare minute is needed for government business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who were involved in this debate the first time around may recall that on that occasion the shadow minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), told a story that Andrew Peacock told him about Sir Robert Menzies' reaction to his maiden speech. The gist of the story is that Sir Robert told Andrew to cut his speech by half&mdash;and it did not matter which half. In regard to this pair of bills, I suggest the government should have applied Sir Robert's wise advice to its own parliamentary program and broken what was really a difficult single omnibus bill into more manageable chunks. Instead, we have a situation where we are back where we were four months ago, while the government sits like a shag on a rock waiting for an electoral tidal wave to engulf it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be here talking about these bills, which were already dealt with once before in this place as part of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. But what happened? Basically there was a breakdown in communication, a failure to treat this parliament as anything more than a simple rubber stamp and an ignorance about the procedures and traditions of this House and of the other place. Had Senator Harradine not complained, rightly in my view, about the unfairness of a mass of complex technical amendments in the one bill, there would have been no split in the original bill on the floor of the Senate. Now we find ourselves back here having to take both parts of that original bill from scratch. Had the government taken the present course in the first place and offered us two bills for cognate debate, we would not have had to go through this charade. Let us not hear anything from the government about delays to Labor's legislation in either house of this parliament. They disrupt their program quite well without any assistance from the coalition, the minor parties or the Independents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal briefly with the bills in substance. Other than a couple of added on provisions, particularly in relation to the child-care cash rebate provisions and the Therapeutic Goods Act, the substance is unchanged. Subject to some concerns about some of the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill, which I will raise in a moment, we have no objection to these bills. Our position is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record from last time they were discussed. Indeed, we want to see the last of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister asked me to raise some specific concerns of his about some provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill which relate to the electronic lodgment of supporting information for listing applications for certain kinds of therapeutic goods. Back in June, when this legislation was first making its way through this parliament, we were urged by the government to get on with the job, because the electronic data lodging facility was due to commence on 1 July 1995, nearly three months ago, and the enabling legislation was vital for its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, overcoming some unexpected administrative obstacles demanded some complicated late night negotiations and midnight meetings involving the shadow minister's office, that of the parliamentary secretary and the office of the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley. Just why is it that the ELF, to give it its fairytale acronym, has been in operation since 1 July&mdash;with nary a hitch, as far as I am aware? The answer is that ways and means were found by way of appropriate delegated legislation. That is not ideal, as we who prefer parliamentary scrutiny of legislative action will attest, but clearly possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only possible conclusion I can come to is that the government does not know whether it is coming or going in relation to its own legislative program. It certainly does not seem to ask itself the question, to adapt a well-known wartime phrase, `Is this legislation really necessary?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Therapeutic Goods Act was empowered by regulations debated in this place in 1990, I was critical of the government for not taking into consideration the demonstrated concerns of the community and the alternative therapies industry. Many Australians today consult alternative therapists and make what they believe to be an informed choice about alternative methods of health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition have always defended the right of Australians to choice. Those who choose alternative therapies such as acupuncture, naturopathy, kinesiology or herbalism have the right to be protected from charlatans and pseudo-medicos. Our obligation as law makers is to provide frameworks within which people can choose the type of health care that they desire, whether it be mainstream medicine with its use of prescriptive pharmaceuticals or alternative therapies with nutritional supplements, herbal remedies and aromatherapy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Natural Medicine Defence Movement has generally welcomed the Therapeutic Goods Act and its regulations in providing one uniform national system of control for the quality, efficacy and safety of therapeutic goods. Nevertheless, it is important that such organisations be continually consulted when changes are made to the act which monitors their tools of trade. Since the act commenced, some 25,000 over-the-counter drug products have been listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Included in that list are a substantial number of traditional Chinese medicine products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the definition of therapeutic goods excludes food&mdash;it was not defined. One of the bills introduces a definition of food, the need for which has arisen because of difficulties for both industry and government in determining whether certain products are to be regulated as therapeutic goods or whether they fall outside that regulatory framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original act's definition of therapeutic goods effectively provided that goods for which there was a therapeutic claim came under the act and those for which there was not such a claim were not covered. The new definition of food is rather convoluted although it is intended to make it clear to manufacturers, before they develop a product, whether they should position it in the market as a food or, alternatively, as a therapeutic good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have considerable reservations regarding the definition of `food'. Inquiries to the Therapeutic Goods Administration drew the following response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A definition for `food' therefore is necessary to establish when such a product is a food, and when it is therapeutic goods. The definition of `food' in Subsection 3(1) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 is therefore solely for the purposes of this act only, to assist industry in formulating and positioning products in the marketplace, and to assist regulators in classifying products for regulatory purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The TGA's response continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of food for the purposes of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 is not therefore intended to cover formula dietary foods or supplementary foods. These are covered under the National Food Authority Food Standards Code, Standards R4 for and R9.</PARA>
<PARA>That last paragraph, straight from the Therapeutic Goods Authority, seems to tell me that as a result of this new definition of `food', formula dietary foods or supplementary foods such as meal replacement products have now been declared not to be food for the purposes of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and therefore are brought in under the act. Remember: under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 the definition of `therapeutic goods' excludes food but now the TGA tells us that the new definition for food does not include formula dietary foods or supplementary foods. It is a bit confusing. I suspect there is going to be a lot of confusion out there in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous products already on the market that could qualify as either a food or a therapeutic good depending on how they are presented and marketed. The argument is made by the TGA that, when presented in capsule or tablet form with dosage regimen and therapeutic claims, these products should be regulated as therapeutic goods. That is where the new definition of food comes in, as manufacturers should now be much more aware of the claims that they make and the form in which the product is manufactured and marketed. Is the whole issue really any clearer than before? I doubt it quite sincerely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also provides for temporary approval for the general supply of drugs that have not been evaluated in Australia. Although there are strict guidelines and criteria governing the temporary approval, some concerns have been expressed with regard to health and safety issues. The whole idea of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 was that all drugs, pharmaceuticals and therapeutic goods should be properly tested and trialled under strict guidelines within Australia before they are made available for general public supply. The major complaint by pharmaceutical companies at the time of the introduction of the therapeutic goods regulations was that Australian requirements were tougher and more stringent than those in a number of other countries in Europe and in the United States. They argued that not only were the requirements more onerous but the format proposed was unique to Australia. In other words, the way in which they were to present their submission for registration was to be in a format that could only be used in Australia&mdash;all this despite the fact that many of the companies are multinational and drugs may well have been on the general market in developed countries around the world for some period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not for one moment want to be seen to be pushing for more relaxed restrictions or clinical trialling requirements, but it seems to me that when implementing the new legislation and regulations in the Australian arena there is not always the necessity to also invent new ways of implementation, new mechanisms for bureaucracies to get their fingers into the pie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provisions restrict temporary approval to such occasions as where there is a shortage of an Australian registered drug or where a registered drug ceases to be available without an equivalent registered product being available. In all cases an application for marketing of the drug in Australia must have already been made or alternatively the product has been approved for general marketing in a specified country. Approval under this provision only applies in respect of drugs specified in schedule 10 of the regulations which, generally speaking, are new chemical entities or prescription drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new section 26A is intended to simplify the procedures and hasten the listing of certain products such as over-the-counter drugs and herbal and vitamin preparations described in schedule 4 of the regulations. The new proceedings will only apply to products for supply into the Australian market. Listable products for export will still be required to be processed through existing procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that on 5 June Senator Crowley announced the introduction of a new streamlining system to be known as the electronic lodgment facility for listing over-the-counter drug products. But it is not clear from the bill whether section 26A is intended to encompass these new procedures. The minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the new system begins operating in a few weeks time, herbal remedies, vitamins, minerals and sunscreen products which meet Australian regulations will be able to be approved much more quickly and for much less cost.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is so, the government is to be congratulated for streamlining what has become a quite cumbersome and long, drawn-out process. On 1 June, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) indicated to the parliament that the average approval time for individual products of five months is well in excess of the initial target of 30 days. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lodgement of an electronic application under the accelerated listing process is expected to be able to reduce the time frame for product approval from an average five months to approximately two weeks.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the period that the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 has been in place, there have been a number of complaints from manufacturers and importers that the approval process has been  too slow and delays often seemingly prolonged. In our initial discussions with the TGA in my office in 1990, we expressed concern that the regulations did not provide for approval within a reasonable time frame. We were then told that our fears were un</PARA>
<PARA>founded and that all applications would be processed speedily and efficiently. The Baume report vindicated my earlier stance and recommended that appropriate performance targets be set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one vital factor in any new listing process is ensuring the integrity of the system. The Australian public must have confidence in our system of evaluation and feel secure in the knowledge that all possible steps have been taken to maintain public health and safety. Although the new procedure provides for the applicant to certify, among other things, that the goods are safe for the purposes for which they will be used and that the drugs do not contain goods that are prohibited imports, some concern has been expressed that the certification may not go far enough. I understand that Senator Harradine has expressed his reservations that we may well be fast-tracking drug evaluations without adequate safety precautions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue which also pertains to therapeutic goods is that of practitioners operating in the wider field of alternative therapies. As alternative therapies become more widely accepted, it is important that the community have confidence in Australian qualifications and accreditation. I note that RMIT in Melbourne has recently introduced an accredited course in traditional Chinese medicine covering such disciplines as acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. That course came about as a result of the expressed demand for Australian qualifications in a discipline that is widely practised by people who have only been trained overseas. I participated in the process of trying to convince the vice-chancellor that this was a proper course of action. I am delighted that the course is up and running. I have great hopes for the future of the course at RMIT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are numerous schools of alternative therapies offering a range of options for learning the various disciplines. They cover correspondence to full-time study, certificates to diplomas and aromatherapy to naturopathy. The question has often been raised as to the value of a mail order certificate in a particular discipline compared with a course that involves extensive client contact and thousands of hours of face-to-face tutoring. Over the past few years, I have had extensive discussions with a range of organisations involved in the training and certification of those who would learn to be practitioners in the field of alternative therapies. I have stressed to them the importance of developing a national code of training infrastructure that has high professional standards and that could be included at an accredited tertiary establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing that the industry itself does not appear to have achieved consensus of a national training accreditation process. Australians must maintain the right to have free and easy access to quality assured alternative medicines and practitioners. I accept that the coalition will not be opposing this bill but I must make the point that it does impose additional regulation on an industry that is already highly regulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many in the community see the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 as imposing additional levels of bureaucracy without any obvious benefit. I have long been a supporter of minimal regulation and minimal bureaucracy while acknowledging that the safety of the public is also paramount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite assurances to the contrary from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, I still have some reservations regarding the powers of search and seizure. The amendments are not quite as tight as the existing act, which could also do with some clarification. The existing act is more specific about search and seizure, with or without a warrant, being related to therapeutic goods. I am somewhat concerned that officers could go off on a `fishing expedition' and take whatever documents or other things that might&mdash;and I emphasise `might'&mdash;or, then again, might not be able to be used in developing a case for prosecution. It seems to me that such powers may not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 54A, which seeks to extend the period of time for bringing a prosecution, also raises some doubts. Is it realistic to allow such a time span? Is there any evidence to suggest that if the TGA diligently applies itself to investigation and preparation of a case the existing two years is inadequate? Will this extension make the bureaucrats any more efficient or are we, by extending the time period, offering them more chance to be less diligent? Surely, if a case is reasonably clear and the public health is at risk, it is not unreasonable on public health grounds alone to ensure that charges are laid and prosecution is undertaken as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that the TGA argues that because of increasing sophistication of both production and distribution, and detection methods, that more than two years might occasionally be necessary to bring a prosecution. But it seems to me its argument begs the question of whether or not our detection and prosecution techniques are not also in need of updating and increased sophistication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no real difficulty with this legislation, and we do not intend to oppose its passage. But we do resent and object to the utterly incompetent way this legislation has been handled, and this is something for which I do not blame the parliamentary secretary but I do blame his minister. It was tempting, under the circumstances, to move on behalf of the coalition a motion noting the incompetent way in which this legislation was originally managed in its passage through this parliament so that the original bill was divided on the floor of the Senate and thus rendered inoperable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is just another example of the Labor government's cavalier and arrogant treatment of the institution of parliament as revealed by the history of these bills. As I said at the beginning, the coalition is not opposing the legislation. Nevertheless, I would be derelict in my duty as a representative of the many people in La Trobe who are concerned with therapeutic goods to not voice their concerns with a number of the amendments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though we now know it is a cognate debate in this House, I would like to put on the record that, as the second reader, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), has stated, the bill also makes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act, the Health Insurance Commission Act, the National Health Act and the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992. It repeals the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974, which has become redundant due to the sunset provisions, as well as the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill. It is a very wide ranging debate. That is why it is with a great deal of pride that I speak on a number of issues covering not only that area but also health in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to see a number of the changes introduced in this legislation today. Most importantly, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) proposes to repeal the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act 1974 and other acts and encompasses relevant amendments to other legislation and is designed to again extend what we in the government continue to do&mdash;that is, look at the amendments that need to be introduced and streamline efficiency. I think the health debate should be about efficiency and not necessarily about putting more money into the system all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we like it or not, good health and wellbeing are the nub of everything we do. It is essential to get our health right before anything else. It is not really surprising that a recent Morgan poll that was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> in early August showed that, for those polled, health care issues rated higher than the current account deficit. A more recent Morgan poll in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> reaffirms that health is a significant issue in the community's mind. Last year a poll of women voters showed conclusively that health issues rate very highly in determining how they vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My research in my electorate tells me that. I speak with my constituents constantly about this issue, as I am sure other members do. I am constantly reminded by the people in my electorate of their interest in the government's health policies and programs. It is our federal government that has recognised the importance that the electorate places on health care. It is aware that it must be attuned to the voters' views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since coming to office our Labor government has now channelled significant resources and energy into improving the lot of ordinary, everyday Australians in all spheres but, in particular, in health. Since the 1983 introduction of Medicare, all sections of the community have had access to medical and hospital services and pharmaceuticals at an affordable cost. That is the bottom line. I think we need to emphasise in this House time and time again that those services are provided at an affordable cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are invariably criticised by the opposition for our health care policies. I take this opportunity to ask those sitting on the opposition benches: does the opposition seriously understand the complexities of government? When our opponents say that our health care system is in disarray, what do they actually mean? Do they mean that people are missing out on vital medical treatment? I hope not, because the surveys have shown that people in this country are getting excellent medical treatment and care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's medical system compares very favourably with that of other countries. Since the mid-1980s, whilst most of the OECD countries have shown a levelling in health expenditure as a percentage of GDP, Australia's expenditure has increased. That our spending is more than sufficient has been backed up not just by government but by various quarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Australian Hospitals Association's annual congress in 1993, it may not just be a question of money. During the 1993 election campaign, and we are all aware of that campaign, in weighing up the major parties' policies&mdash;they were the days when the opposition had policies&mdash;the congress concluded that Australia's spending of around 8.1 per cent of GDP on health is about right. As well, that forum overwhelmingly maintained that increased efficiency is more important than increased funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies show conclusively that over recent decades the health status of Australians has improved significantly, aided no doubt by our health care system which guarantees universal coverage and yields a large measure of satisfaction at a reasonable overall cost to the economy. Achieving equity in health care is no simple task in Australia's federal system of government with its overlapping jurisdictions&mdash;each state having their own vested interests&mdash;wide array of service providers and constantly changing health and sociological trends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1994-95 OECD surveys show that Australians are now enjoying one of the best managed and socially accepted health systems among OECD countries. In June this year, the OECD's publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Australia</EMPHASIS> compared Australia's health care system performance with that of other OECD nations. This publication confirmed, yet again, that this government has contained health care spending while significantly improving the nation's health status. According to that report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community satisfaction with Medicare is high and rising.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to praise Australia's additional budget allocations to enhance home and community care services for the aged and for the disabled; the reforms that we have implemented to private health insurance; Australia's best practice in the health arena; and the reforms to the pharmacy and pathology industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the report criticises any further state government hospital budget cuts, warning that such would undermine Medicare's commitment to universal access to free quality hospital care. Realistically, if Medicare does not operate at optimum levels it would be because it is being thwarted by conservative state governments. I acknowledge that it is a bit old hat to speak these days about the coalition's lack of policy. I will just briefly mention their incredible propensity for inconsistency and say that the opposition's new found commitment to Medicare is looking shakier by the minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to place a couple of examples on the record. Earlier this year, the new shadow health minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), said that Medicare will stay. But then the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made it clear on 1 February that he was considering dismantling universal access. Meanwhile, the incoming member for Bradfield&mdash;a doctor himself&mdash;was spending considerable time in Canberra campaigning for a two-tier Medicare levy and the abolition of bulk-billing. I understand that the future member for Bradfield is a longstanding opponent of bulk-billing and he campaigned on that even during his preselection. My question to the Liberals and through them to the coalition is: does the coalition have the abolition of bulk-billing on its agenda? Just what is the opposition's position, given the contrary statements by the future member for Bradfield?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The clear aims and objectives of the Labor government and the contradictions of the opposition distinguish the two sides very markedly. The system that the ALP has developed has been performing well. Doctors are treating more patients through public hospitals and are doing more with less. Average lengths of stay are decreasing and home treatment facilities are being more efficiently utilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, there is room for improvement in the area of elective surgery waiting times. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is presently working on this issue with state ministers and plans are under way to improve waiting times for surgery, such as hip and knee replacements, as part of a recently announced $10 million government package. Seven hospitals across Australia have been earmarked to pilot streamlining their pre-admission and discharge procedures and are held up as examples of efficient waiting list management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These federal government grants will enable the seven hospitals to collaborate with other hospitals Australia-wide to assist them in reducing patient care within their own hospitals. In deflecting the criticism we receive, one can ask: is it any wonder that the system might clog down at times? Consider the technology that has been absorbed over the past 10 to 20 years. Coronary artery bypass grafting, hip replacements and organ transplants are just a few examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improving health standards is accentuated by other portfolios in their policy formulation. Recognising that living standards and health are inextricably linked to where we live and that people need to have places where they can have fulfilling lives, the Department of Housing and Regional Development, I am pleased to say, is playing its part. That department is ever cognisant that suburb design and infrastructure, access to services such as health facilities and affordable housing make a significant impact on health. Under the Better Cities II program, ways to improve the quality of our urban environment and development are high on that agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also that the bill contains amendments to accommodate changes in the child-care area. A very important element of the government's child-care policy is the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate introduced in July 1994. This cash payment helps offset child-care expenses while both parents or sole parents are working, studying, training or looking for work, and improving the affordability of child care for many of our working parents. There is no doubt that quality child care is a must in assisting people in their aspirations for productive and satisfying lifestyles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also support the provision in the bill to allow the Health Insurance Commission to market its knowledge and expertise internationally. In these days of user pays, such a scheme is a logical approach. To date its work has included consultancies in a number of overseas countries under the auspices of the World Bank, the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and, latterly, the United Nations development program. It seems commonsense to me&mdash;if we have the expertise, why not sell it? I am well aware that such a scheme can work very well. </PARA>

According to the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An optimistic future: attitudes to ageing and well being into the next century</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the product of a survey commissioned last year by the Department of Human Services and Health&mdash;of 2,000 Australians surveyed in the 40 to 55 and 55 to 75 age brackets, we are faring very well. In comparison with other countries our locals seem to have more positive attitudes than their European counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey challenged the misconception that aging is a negative experience and an end, rather than a new chapter. The survey found that attitudes to aging and wellbeing among older Australians are that they are enthusiastic in undertaking new activities and challenges. The overall results were very positive and demonstrate a strong degree of optimism towards the future. Over 88 per cent of respondents said that they are `mostly positive about the future'; 90 per cent judged their health to be good, very good, or excellent, and many anticipated new and exciting possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study shows that older people want to play a greater role in the community, feel good about themselves, and feel healthy and positive in their outlook. Despite complaints about our government's policies from the opposition, as I said earlier, it seems we are well on target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the wake of this major report, the government has set up a national network of older Australians advisory councils to advise the Minister for Human Services and Health on relevant matters relating to their wellbeing. Among other work, the councils will consider the needs and concerns of older people and the effectiveness and relevance of Commonwealth government services or funding in meeting those needs. Anyone seeking information about what the federal government is providing in the health sphere can find a wide array of programs and work plans to improve all Australians' wellbeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has always concentrated on identifying problems and finding the solutions to fix them. In this vein, funding has been approved for the Australian Consumers' Council to develop a national health consumers' charter as part of our government's commitment to stronger patient involvement in health care. The charter will enable patients to make clear, informed decisions about their treatment so that they can weigh up the benefits and risks and, most importantly, be fully aware of their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of the government's health strategy has been focusing on women's health, as last year's successful national campaign to fight breast cancer testifies. But it was not surprising to see the first national men's health summit held in Melbourne recently. The government considers the health and wellbeing of Australian men to be of paramount importance. Responding to the needs in this area, our government has initiated various programs, including a recently funded study into the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, among the myriad of grants this year to relevant organisations I was pleased to note funding to the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council to consider the health views and concerns of multicultural Australia. These views will be pivotal in formulating a clear and concise picture of the major health issues confronting people from non-English speaking backgrounds who have made Australia their home. I am well placed to comment on the worthiness of such programs. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent an electorate with a very high percentage of migrants, with whom I have constant contact, and programs of this ilk have very special significance for them. I am quite sure that my constituents will appreciate the government's efforts in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether it be finances and support to tackle HIV-AIDS, breast cancer, anorexia nervosa, hepatitis C, diabetes research, drug addiction, or projects to investigate reducing heart disease in the elderly through exercise, the government remains committed to the concept of equity for all Australians, despite the climate of mounting economic pressures. I am very pleased to support the tenets of this piece of legislation today, and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable members to think back to what happened at the last election, in 1993. Graham Richardson was the minister for health then. He had $100 million to fix waiting lists. How was the government going to pay for it? `We are going to pay for it by attacking all this fraud and over-servicing, and we are going to buy public beds in private hospitals.' How much of that $100 million promised at the last election was spent? I think the government has spent about $500,000 of it at John Flynn Hospital in Queensland. The plan was an absolute flop. The $100 million you were going to find from so-called fraud and over-servicing never materialised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. I hope you do not have to warn the parliamentary secretary again. I will tell you why the system is bogged down. It is very simple. The Department of Human Services and Health reckons, on its own estimates, that the people who dropped out of private health insurance between 1 July 1993 and 30 September 1994 will use 322,000 public hospital bed days this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now 322,000 public hospital bed days is about two quite large city public hospitals crammed full 365 days a year. So just those people who drop their private health insurance in a 15-month period are going to cram two big city hospitals full to the brim 365 days a year. You just cannot build an extra two public hospitals a year to cope with that. You have, therefore, a far greater number of people seeking to use a limited resource. The reason the public hospitals in Australia are bogged down, as your own department identified, is the drop-out from private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, if you wish to ask any state leader of any political persuasion what the drop-out of private insurance is doing to the bottom line for their public hospital budgets, you would find that it is wreaking havoc. We are losing over two per cent of the Australian population every year from private health insurance and you cannot compensate for it, so the system gets bogged down and comes under strain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would love to blame new technology. You would love to blame anyone but yourself. But the fact is, the ideological blinkers that prevent the Labor Party from doing anything about private health insurance mean the public hospitals are brim full. The Labor Party may not understand this, the Australian public does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, one thing I do agree with the parliamentary secretary on is Medicare is a pretty good system and it provides a good number of benefits that the Australian public like. But let's not be dewy-eyed about it like the Labor caucus. The Secretary of the Department of Human Services and Health, Dr Duckett, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Health Review</EMPHASIS> actually identified two failings of Medicare. The first was cost shifting between governments and the second was that Medicare is a poor setter of priorities. These are very important points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was having a discussion with a gynaecological oncologist some weeks ago, a person who treats gynaecological cancers. He said to me&mdash;it was about 2 o'clock in the afternoon&mdash;`Already today I have prescribed taxol illegally three times for public patients that I have contrived to be private patients, because if I don't do that they will not get the drugs they need for their cancer.' So one doctor in one morning had shifted $10,000 of costs from a state government onto the federal government. This is happening right across Australia and you do not have a clue how to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area where this is happening is in imaging. We hear the Labor Party get stuck into diagnostic imaging for the great and rapid increase in its use&mdash;11 per cent compound a year&mdash;and if you took them at face value, you would actually be worried about it. But there is a very interesting thing with diagnostic imaging: we do not make any of the photographic plate to do the X-rays or the images in Australia; it is all imported. So, we know exactly how much photographic plate is coming into Australia. The fact is that in recent years the amount of photographic plate coming in has increased in parallel with the rise in population, yet the cost to the federal government is going up at 11 per cent per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than get stuck into the radiology profession, you would be better to look at the cost shifting that your system encourages and that you have consistently failed to do anything about for a decade. Because the only explanation for those figures I have given is that the total amount of photographs being done in diagnostic imaging is pretty much the same. The 11 per cent increase comes because the federal government is paying for a lot more of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that Dr Duckett described as a `failure' of Medicare was that it is poor at setting priorities. We see this particularly in the area of preventative health. It was interesting that the parliamentary secretary finished her speech by extolling the virtues of what the government had done, or was doing, in preventative health. If there was something even vaguely genuine about what she said I would back her, but there is nothing genuine here. It is overblown rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare is poor at setting priorities. Our conflict is simply this: on one hand we have government departments and government ministers encouraging people to go out there, to get screened, to get tests done, to have a whole stack of things done, but, on the other hand, the same government ministers get upset when that generates new work, pushes up the country's pathology and radiological imaging bills, and&mdash;quite unfairly&mdash;the pathologists and the radiologists cop the flak for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that preventative health is an area of gross negligence. There is no better example than the immunisation of Australia's kids. Under Labor, 53 per cent of Australian children are fully immunised&mdash;26th worst out of 28 in the Western world. Try to explain that away! Vietnam can manage to have 97 per cent of its kids being immunised under a voluntary system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what is the government's response? It is, `Oh, well, we'll have a national register'. If you were to ring up the minister's press secretary, she would say, `Oh look, we have fixed that up; we gave $18 million in the budget to fix it'. But there is a problem with that: the $18 million is for only two years. If it is such a great scheme, why run it for only two years? The second problem is this: if we actually know that every second kid on the street is not fully immunised, we do not need a detailed register to tell us. There is no better example of the negligence and culpability of a government than its failure to immunise its kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a measles epidemic in Sydney at this very moment. There has recently been a whooping cough epidemic in Canterbury, an upper middle-class suburb of Melbourne. Those epidemics do not just threaten the kids who are not immunised, they threaten my four-month-old kid who is not fully immunised because, once a society drops below a certain level of immunisation, you get epidemics. The fact is, when you look at whooping cough, measles and rubella, the incidence in Australia has gone up 17 times in just the last five years. That is how quickly it can change if you drop the ball. That is preventative health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that some people in this place, like me, have long memories. I remember the Better Health Commission; I remember when it was set up in 1985; I remember the lofty, overblown rhetoric. Actually, I recently tracked down someone from the Better Health Commission and I asked them to tell me about it. The reply was very illustrative. They said, `On reflection, I think we were all conned; I think we were there to give the appearance of doing something while not actually doing anything at all'. The Better Health Commission reported in 1986; in 1988, goals and targets were published; they were republished in 1992 and republished in 1993. There were 400 goals and targets&mdash;basically, `If you've got a problem or you are an interest group, we have a goal and a target for you'. But, at some stage, you actually have to look at outcomes. At some stage you have to go beyond rhetoric. At some stage you have to judge a government not by what they say but by what they achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you what the chairman of the department of community medicine at the University of New South Wales, Professor Peter Baume&mdash;someone the government uses for its inquiries, even though he is a former coalition member&mdash;said about how many of those 400 goals and targets we will achieve by the year 2000. He said, `One'. The only goal and target we will achieve by the year 2000, according to Professor Baume, is in connection with childhood mortality, which has absolutely nothing to do with anything the federal government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the parliamentary secretary talk about diabetes education. I have a very personal interest in this. I have a memory, too. I remember the national diabetes action plan of 1988. Perhaps some of the government members would care to talk about what happened to that plan. This is an important area of preventative health. It took us 72 years, from the discovery of insulin in 1921 to 1993, to prove that good diabetic control leads to a reduction in symptoms. Those symptoms are nasty and include loss of limb, loss of eyesight, heart disease and kidney failure. We can prevent those symptoms. We could prevent them if the government had implemented what it promised it was going to do in 1988. We could have saved the country a lot of money, and we could have dramatically changed the life of those people and their families who had diabetes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of preventative medicine is that of folic acid supplementation. It is beyond controversy that, if women planning a pregnancy&mdash;and 60 per cent of pregnancies are planned&mdash;supplemented their diet with folic acid at the time of conception, it would cut the rate of spina bifida by half. One in 1,000 kids in Australia is born with spina bifida. Imagine what we could do if we could reduce that by half. Imagine the economic savings and the social savings. What percentage of Australian women know that? What percentage of Australian women planning a pregnancy supplement their diet with folic acid? My guess is less than five per cent. We have a lot of work to do here. We can do it cooperatively or we can keep doing it the way it has been done until now, with falsehoods and misrepresentations. Let us have no more of that humbug. We will judge the government not by what it says but by what it does. </PARA>

Is it any wonder that the people of Australia are looking at the opposition with increasing suspicion when they refuse to say what their policies are?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on a couple of points that were made by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). He talked about crammed hospitals and how we have neglected people who do not have private cover. What he did not point out is that there are new advantages for people who take up private health insurance. After about 15 years of not having any private health insurance, I am thinking about again taking it up myself. Before anyone says that someone like me should be able to take up private health insurance because I can afford to, I hasten to point out that our incomes determine what Medicare payments are taken out of our salaries. So it is according to income that one makes payments into Medicare, and that is a very fair system. Perhaps the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pays more than twice as much as you or me and perhaps we pay twice as much as people on very low incomes. That is fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is now an enticement for people to take up private health insurance. There is an arrangement between funds and private hospitals which, I believe, will change the context of what is happening in some of our public wards. People can obtain 100 per cent cover, and that is genuine cover. It does not mean that people are being told they can get 100 per cent of a determined fee and then find that the institution or the practitioner puts up the price even higher than the highest determined fee. It means genuine 100 per cent cover is available to people. The costs will all be listed on one bill, and it will be clear and transparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to make a point about what the honourable member for Chisholm said about immunisation. This week I received a letter from an organisation which opposes compulsory immunisation. We have to recognise that unlike in Vietnam, which it quoted, there are people in Australia who believe it is their right not to have their children immunised. I am not sure whether we should take that into account; I do not propose to debate that at this stage. I would point out to the writer that we operate under different circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I thoroughly agree with him that there ought to be immunisation of all children. The vaccines used are properly tested. There is no proven danger from most of the vaccines other than to people who are sensitive to them. I fully endorse what he said about the need for more immunisation in Australia but we need to take it in the context that we are operating in in Australia. When we had compulsory X-rays for all Australians, tuberculosis was almost wiped out in our nation. When that compulsory system of regular X-rays was removed, tuberculosis did creep back. We have to draw the line somewhere. That is what we are doing in health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is not particularly controversial but it makes some important points. I would like to emphasise some of them. One is the empowerment of the Health Insurance Commission to engage in providing consulting, management and related services in the exercise of its powers and to perform its functions overseas. Just recently, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, which is chaired by our colleague the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), had before it an expert who suggested that we ought to be selling our health and education systems overseas. He said that Medicare is something which could be of value to other countries. The Health Insurance Commission has already undertaken a number of consultancies primarily&mdash;but not exclusively&mdash;under the auspices of the World Bank. These activities are getting bigger. There is a need for the commission to have explicit provision to cover this sort of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that we have one of the best health systems in the world. The recent issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> has indicated that the United Kingdom is having problems with its health system. It costs about seven per cent of its gross domestic product, whereas the United States health system, which is not a similarly organised system as it runs on the private system, consumes about 14 per cent of its gross domestic product&mdash;double that in the UK. Australia is in between. It has a better scheme than either of those systems. It has a very good scheme. It does not have the problems of the United States, for instance, of drugs sometimes being three times the price they are in Australia, because we have that negotiating between government and firms under our pharmaceutical benefits system. We have a good system and it is worth selling overseas. I applaud the fact that allowance is made for that in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also makes provision for a number of amendments in relation to nursing homes which are being granted exempt bed status. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Throphaneous) said in the second reading speech to the bill, it is important that we have required standards of care and that the exempt bed status remains&mdash;or is given&mdash;to those nursing homes which satisfy the standards for nursing and personal care. That is particularly important. Those required standards include treating people with dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was involved with the Archbishop of Canberra and Goulburn, Francis Carroll, in the opening of an extension to Currawanna in Bombala. That hostel for the frail aged has an enviable record. Not more than 85 per cent of the pension is charged to any client&mdash;pensioner client or non-pensioner client; that 85 per cent is the limit for all of them. That is because of very strong community support. One of the directors, Paddy Lomas, asked me to convey to the minister thanks for the personal care subsidies that go to Currawanna. I am pleased that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the parliamentary secretary are in the House today to hear those thanks from the hostel for the frail aged in Bombala for that personal care subsidy which, they said, along with the tremendous community support they get, enables them to charge one of the lowest rates in New South Wales. </PARA>

He practised medicine which included not just Western medicine but also some of the concepts of Eastern medicine and of alternative medicine. There are practitioners in Australia today who are able to do that on a much wider scale than they were in the past. Our general practitioners are acknowledging the truth that is in alternate medicine procedures. When I say `alternative' I mean alternative to the traditional form of Western medicine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that, when that happens, all that we provide in the way of drugs or therapeutic goods should contain what they are stated to contain on the labels. It is important, too, that illegal therapeutic goods of unknown quality, safety and efficacy should be removed from the market. So, while we acknowledge the validity of alternative medicine and alternate treatments, we also ought to perform our duty to people and ensure that there is quality and safety within the medicinal products. I am pleased to support both pieces of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA>I would like to reiterate some concerns I have about this legislation which I have stated previously in this place, and that is to do with the changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act dealing with the definition of `food'. Item 2, subsection 3(1) of the bill inserts a definition of `food' which I will not read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as it has been referred to fairly extensively by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). I was delighted to note a few moments ago in the gallery the presence of an eminent Western Australian medical scientist, Cheryll McCullough. I am sure she will be most interested in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am taking an interest in a particular section of this bill is not because of my immense enjoyment of food&mdash;which would be immediately evident to even the most casual observer&mdash;but because of a complaint from a constituent of mine, Mr Morris Czarniack. Mr Czarniack was recently fined $96,000 for allegedly breaching the Therapeutic Goods Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before going on about this case, let me submit an alternative definition of food. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gould Medical Dictionary</EMPHASIS> defines it in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any organic substance which, when ingested or taken into the body of an organism through some alternate means and assimilated, may be used either to supply energy or build tissue; classified in three groups: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, all of which may occur in animal or vegetable substance.</PARA>
<PARA>Mosby's dictionary defines food in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any substance, usually of plant or animal origin, consisting of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and such supplementary elements as minerals and vitamins, that is ingested or otherwise taken into the body and assimilated to provide energy to promote growth, repair, and maintenance essential for sustaining life.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that we have covered this matter in the debate on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. However, since the government made errors and has been forced to reintroduce this bill, I will put to the House the further concerns of Mr Czarniack, whom I mentioned when I spoke on the last bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I mentioned the medical definition of food is to contrast it with the legislation we are debating. Mr Czarniack recently went on trial for selling a product called Well Being Essiac Herbal Mist, which the Therapeutic Goods Administration deemed to be in breach of the Therapeutic Goods Act. The product was made only of food products&mdash;that is, food according to the definitions of the medical dictionaries. Certainly in their individual states, the ingredients would probably also fall within the definition used in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time I previously spoke about this matter, I pointed out that Mr Czarniack's house was raided by 11 federal police simply for selling a product made only of food products. I sympathised with him then, but, since the recent events at my own office, my sympathy to him and his family is even greater. Mr Czarniack was charged with selling a product which breached the Therapeutic Goods Act. He asserted that his product was simply a food product which was not consumed in the normal ways but was rubbed into the skin and absorbed by the skin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Mr Czarniack, his product fell within the definition of food. To prove that, he even ate the product. He spooned it into this mouth and swallowed it. He ate the stuff, yet according to this legislation it is not food. Perhaps it was a Clayton's food&mdash;the food you have when you are not really having food. Mr Czarniack's cream was full of nutrients which, according to the medical dictionary, are those products that afford nutrition. Nutrition is defined as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sum processes concerned in the growth, maintenance and repair of the living body as a whole or its constituent parts, especially those processes most directly involved in the intake, metabolism and utilisation of food.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Czarniack's creams were made only of food products. When mixed together, they formed a cream which was rubbed into the skin. The active ingredient was egg; that is, that is the ingredient that assisted the other ingredients to be absorbed or ingested and taken into the body. All the other ingredients were food as well. The eggs simply allowed the other foods of nutritional value to be ingested through one's skin. For that, Mr Czarniack had his home, pharmacy and his parents' home raided by 11 federal police and he was fined $96,000. It does sound farcical. It would be funny if it were not completely true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, Mr Czarniack's theory was that certain parts of the skin are lacking in nutrition and are therefore impaired, so to speak. Mr Czarniack thought that the best route to feed nutrients to that area of the body was as close as possible to it. His theory was to feed the nutrients in through the skin. He mixed in together the foods he thought relevant. They were to provide the nutrients. Adding the egg enabled the nutrients to be absorbed or ingested through the skin. Essentially, the skin ingests the food and the body is being fed, just in a completely different way. Nevertheless, it does not stop his creams being defined as food, just as the stuff fed through the nasogastric tubes is still food, no matter how it is ingested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Czarniack was charged and fined because it was alleged that his products were therapeutic and breached the TGA. He disputed this, saying it was simply food. Following his case, these amendments came in offering a definition of food under the TGA. It suggests that food means goods for oral consumption which meet certain criteria. The oral consumption requirement alone would exclude Mr Czarniack's goods. While only made of food, they would not be considered food because they are not taken orally but are rubbed into the skin. The reason I am speaking up for Mr Czarniack is that I believe he has been treated very unfairly. While I have no problem with there being a definition of food in the legislation, I question the definition and why a product made completely of foods&mdash;and it falls within the definition of foods according to the medical dictionaries&mdash;will not be a food by this legislation, even though it can be eaten and swallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what if it is used as a cream? It is still food. I understand Mr Czarniack would not register his product with the TGA because it would have exposed the make-up of the product to his competitors, whom I understand reported him to the TGA. But the legislation did not offer him protection from their stealing his idea, the essential qualities of his product&mdash;and perhaps that is something which should be considered for future changes to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the TGA argued Mr Czarniack's products were therapeutic. He argued they were simply a food. Since then, we find this legislation has made it to the House to offer a definition of food, and I guess the story would go that Mr Czarniack could not call his products food because they do not fall within the TGA definition, though they would, I understand, fall within the definitions offered in medical dictionaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Czarniack took the view that his product was not a therapeutic good but simply a food product consumed in an alternative way but which was beneficial to the body, as food is by definition. I concede that claims about the qualities of the product may have constituted it as therapeutic. It is perhaps the fault of the legislation that this gentleman, an innovative and creative man, can be punished so severely for showing some flair and inventiveness. I trust the government will take on board the views of Mr Czarniack. He is, as I say, a creative and innovative man whose initiative should be nurtured and not legislated against. He needs to be approached by the Department of Human Services and Health and have the views of small inventors and pharmacists listened to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear this legislation, or at least parts thereof, is at the instigation of bigger companies who disliked the competition Mr Czarniack was offering. I concede Mr Czarniack's products may fall within definitions of the TGA for therapeutic qualities in that they may be promoted as performing a certain function. But, at the end of the day, it is still just plain old food. I take it this legislation is now here to stop Mr Czarniack and his innovations, perhaps at the behest of the large multinationals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add I have been contacted by many constituents who had in the past used these products and found a need for them. They could not understand how Mr Czarniack was being victimised, as he was, by officials from the TGA. They could not understand why they were not allowed to consume his products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by making a few points about which I hope the parliamentary secretary can satisfy my curiosity. The definition in this legislation for food says it must provide hydration. On that point, would ice, because of its application to reduce swelling, inflammation and so on be considered therapeutic and, therefore, cause water authorities, ice vendors and so on to register with the TGA? How about yoghurt? We all know that yoghurt has therapeutic uses, one of them being that women can apply it to their vaginas to treat thrush. Yoghurt is a food but it appears it would not be treated as food by this definition because it must be taken orally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same with vinegar. Vinegar, as we all know, is pretty effective in treating forms of insect and marine bites. It is rubbed onto the skin and not taken orally; so, if vinegar is used therapeutically, it cannot be claimed to be a food. This may be drawing a long bow in comparison to Mr Czarniack's case, but the principle I believe is pretty much the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the definition of food is that it must satisfy a hunger. Does that mean bulking agents which have therapeutic claims and which satisfy a hunger will be classed as food even though they have no nutritional value? Why can we have therapeutic goods which satisfy a hunger or thirst but which offer no nutrition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would again urge members of the department to listen to people like Mr Czarniack. He is not a witch doctor. I have met him on quite a number of occasions over the years. He does not have two heads. He does not oscillate dead cats over his head in cemeteries at midnight. He is just an ordinary bloke trying to run a business. I hope these concerns of his are heeded. I look forward to hearing of dialogue between the department and Mr Czarniack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to address a few comments made earlier in the debate by the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). She was telling us about how great Medicare is. Labor has lied about the Medicare levy, as you would know. They have bumped it up since its introduction, which has only resulted in more people leaving private health insurance. Membership of private health insurance has dropped from 91.5 per cent in 1983 to 35 per cent in August this year. That is why we have over 100,000 people waiting for elective surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has Labor done about this problem? Not a single thing. I predict that at the next election Labor will tell porky after porky about our health policy. They lied about it at the last election and they will do it again. That is why they do not support truth in political advertising. If Medicare is so great, why are doctors telephoning my office saying that Medicare has not paid them for their bulk billing? One doctor is still waiting for $18,000, which Medicare owes him and which has been overdue for some time. Another doctor is waiting for $11,000. As the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) said in a debate earlier this week, he wanted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to tell the chamber about the neglect of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in the administration of her department. Right now there are tens of millions of dollars in Medicare bills that have not been paid and which have been outstanding for over a month. The minister claims that the Health Insurance Commission wants an 11-day turnaround. In August, after one month, 1 1/2 million bills remain unpaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the HIC has been sitting on over $33 million which should have been paid weeks earlier. Some 10 per cent of bills have not been paid. Maybe the minister has been distracted from administering her portfolio, but this raises very serious questions about the sort of job she is doing.</PARA>
<PARA>Just to correct the propaganda being spouted by the member for Prospect earlier&mdash;and this was also mentioned by the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge)&mdash;I point out that it seems to me that members of the government think that if they repeat the lie often enough people will believe it. They are experts at rewriting history. I put on the record that last year over 100,000 Australians were waiting in queues for elective surgery&mdash;a third of those had been waiting for over six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Labor's 1983 election policy the then Labor leader, Bob Hawke, promised Medicare would mean that `nine out of 10 Australians will pay less for the health needs of themselves and their families'. Health costs have increased since 1983 beyond the rate of inflation. Mr Hawke said in his 1984 election policy in November 1984:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the term of our next government the Medicare levy will not be increased.</PARA>
<PARA>The levy was increased from one per cent to 1.25 per cent from December 1986. Health Minister Blewett said to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 23 January 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I could give a guarantee that there would be no increase in the (1.25%) levy and fundamental changes to Medicare over the three year period.</PARA>
<PARA>Labor subsequently introduced a $2.50 Medicare co-payment from June 1991, which it subsequently replaced with an increase in the levy to 1.4 per cent, announced in August 1992 and effective from July 1993. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) said on 19 June 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no proposal to increase the levy and there won't be.</PARA>
<PARA>The levy was increased from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent from 1 July 1995. You might have been able to con the people at the election in 1993, but I think the battlers have had it up to their necks with the Labor Party. They will not believe you again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be supporting the amendment that has been moved by the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron). Last week in a debate on industrial relations, I made the comment that if there is one issue in this House that gets the opposition fired up it is industrial relations. I guess I have to say that there are two issues. There are two issues which I love to debate&mdash;industrial relations and human services and health issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are clearly defined differences between the views of the Labor Party and the views of the opposition in terms of these two issues. For a number of reasons, I always had a lot of pleasure speaking on human services and health legislation. One of the reasons is that it highlights the differences between the government and the opposition on matters of basic public and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We just heard the usual nonsense about Medicare. I was intrigued by the member for Stirling's comments about private health insurance membership numbers. He said that the numbers had dropped from 91 per cent in 1983 to 35 per cent now. I wonder why that happened. He seems to have forgotten that in 1983 there was no Medicare; there was no national health system. Unless you were a pension or a welfare beneficiary you had to have private health insurance. No wonder 91 per cent of people had private health insurance. Now only 35 per cent of people have private health insurance. I will come to that point in a minute. The private health insurance reforms of this government are in the news again today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always enjoy speaking in support of government legislation, particularly bills that have been introduced by this minister at the table, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), because we have made a lot of worthwhile reforms to the health system. Medicare is a fine system. It is the best health insurance system in the world. It is the envy of other Western countries such as the United States. Some people in the current US administration have certainly expressed interest in how Medicare works. But just because Medicare is a great system does not mean that we cannot continue to improve it. That is what this government is doing with the various pieces of legislation that it has introduced into the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier on today we had the coalition's health spokesperson, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), in here attacking the government over health and over Medicare in his usual churlish manner. Now we have a fairly churlish amendment, which no doubt we will have to vote on later today, moved by the member for Stirling, trying to score political points on Medicare and on health. As at the last election when health and industrial relations along with the GST were defining issues, I expect that, once again, both health and industrial relations will be defining issues in the minds of the Australian public when they go to vote at the next election&mdash;whenever that is going to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This morning I was interested to hear that one of the lead items on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABC News</EMPHASIS> was concern about how this government's private health insurance legislation, which is supposed to take effect from next Sunday, 1 October, was in trouble. Apparently, it was in trouble because the AMA is going out and telling its members who are doctors not to sign the contracts, which would sabotage the intent of the private health insurance legislation&mdash;even though some doctors have already indicated they will sign the contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is interesting to look at the issue of contracts and the coalition's policy&mdash;or lack of it&mdash;in relation to the industrial relations debate. This week we have had a bit of focus on industrial relations. That is not surprising given the obvious intent of the coalition, if it ever does get elected to government, to take some pretty draconian measures on industrial relations. The `take the contract or take the sack' mentality will come in. It has been foreshadowed at every election since 1983 that, if the coalition were ever elected, we would have these attacks on trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wouldn't it be interesting if we applied that philosophy to the private health insurance legislation? We could say to the doctors, `Well, either take the contract or we don't pay you Medicare benefits any more.' How would that sit? How would the AMA react then? It would be very interesting to consider the attitude of the AMA, which in some senses is a bit of a trade union&mdash;although that is stretching the term a bit, I think. With apologies to the rest of the legitimate trade union movement, the AMA does act as a bit of a trade union, a union of doctors. It is a pretty greedy, grubby one at that. Nevertheless, in some senses it does play that role. It is now urging its members not to sign the contracts under the private health insurance legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I refer to a speech that I made in this House on 27 March in which I drew the attention of the House to comments by the new Liberal candidate for the seat of Bradfield, Dr Brendan Nelson. He was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Health and Aged Care Journal</EMPHASIS> in February this year as saying the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some areas of policy I will be seen as very liberal and progressive, and in others I'll be quite dry. For example, in the field of industrial relations, I assume a position perhaps even to the right of John Howard.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Dr Brendan Nelson's position on industrial relations. Of course, he is the former President of the Australian Medical Association. I ask the question again: wouldn't it be interesting if we applied the same sort of industrial relations philosophy of the Liberal Party&mdash;that is, take the contract or take the sack&mdash;to health policy? Perhaps we could tell the doctors that if they do not do it our way we will stop paying them medicare benefits. I do not think that would go down too well&mdash;why should we accept it in industrial relations?&mdash;especially after the great lengths that this government has gone to in the area of private health insurance to deal with the issue of falling numbers in health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, if it were up to me I would let the numbers drop altogether. I am a great believer in the public health system. I know that private health insurance has its purposes and, in the area of ancillary benefits as opposed to hospital benefits, I am still a member of a private health insurance fund&mdash;Medibank Private. I know that a number of people are. In areas that Medicare does not cover, such as dentistry, chiropractic and physiotherapy, private health insurance does come in handy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of hospital cover we have falling numbers. But this government, through the legislation that was passed eventually by both houses, has bent over backwards&mdash;it has gone to great lengths&mdash;to deal with that by bringing in a more efficient and comprehensive scheme whereby private health insurance can be useful and the erosion of private health insurance numbers can be stopped. But what does the AMA want to do? It wants to sabotage it. It wants to coax its members not to sign contracts, obviously in the hope that it will fall over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we hear from the coalition? The coalition do not seem to have a health policy at the moment. I guess in a sense that is not surprising. The last five that they have had failed dismally at the polls. We are still waiting to hear what their health policy will be at the next election. I guess the reason we have not heard yet is that the AMA has not written it for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition accuses the government of having vested interests at heart, and having a special relationship with the trade union movement. Why shouldn't we have one? The very history of the Labor Party is tied up with trade unionism in Australia, so why would we not have a special relationship with the working people of Australia and with those elected to represent the working people in the workplace&mdash;the trade union movement? Certainly the coalition does not have such a relationship. We all know what will happen if the coalition get in. The Accord will be ripped up and we will have draconian legislation and draconian industrial relations policies that we have heard about already this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA, another special interest group which drives just about all of coalition policy on health&mdash;or what there is of policy&mdash;has not written the coalition's policy for the next election yet, and that is why we have not heard what it is. I guess we will be waiting for the sixth attempt by the coalition to come up with some coherent health policy. I do not expect that it will be much better than the previous five. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health, like industrial relations, will be a battleground in the election and a fairly easy one for the government to knock over the coalition on once again, because they just do not have an answer. Medicare is here to stay. The coalition talks about how they now embrace Medicare. They even embrace basic bulk-billing. Maybe the penny is starting to drop. But they still do not mind having a whack at us when they come in here moving churlish amendments and attacking the minister and the government on health policy. What is their policy? When is the AMA going to provide the opposition with their policy? Obviously they have not written it yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government continues, as with this legislation, to further improve our health system. We do not rest on our laurels. Just because we have Medicare and it works does not mean that we cannot try to improve it, as we are doing in cooperation with COAG and state governments in the coordinated care trials which have been advertised in the last week or so and are for public discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue to do that. The Labor government is about reforming and making the health system accessible to all Australians and equitable for all Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You might have understood that if there were some matter of enormous moment, if there were some issue that they wanted to bring out which they wanted to deal with in some dramatic way, but we have had no amendments moved to the legislation, with no indication from the opposition parties that there is anything particularly that they want to go on about. So one wonders what the whole point of that exercise was in requiring the two bills to be separated. But then to say that we were wasting parliamentary time is an absurdity. The reality is that it was they and other parties in the Senate that forced this division of the bill into two. We are happy to re-present it in that form to accommodate people, but it is a bit rich to then come in here and say we were wasting parliamentary time. It is they that have done this in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Precisely because there are not really that many controversial issues in this legislation, even though it deals with a whole range of programs in health and some in human services, we have had a very wide ranging debate and discussion. What has essentially happened is that, because people did not have much to say about the bill and the legislation, they have turned&mdash;especially the opposition members&mdash;to having a go at the government in relation to our policies, particularly the health policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been very little that has been raised on the bill itself. There were some matters concerning the administration of therapeutic goods, but the government is putting into place through this bill a number of amendments to further streamline that administration to make that administration easier and, more importantly, to overcome problems where there has been criminal or quasi-criminal activity in relation to therapeutic goods. The House has not opposed that. So the overall thrust is that the bill's general provisions obviously are being supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to discuss some of the matters raised by honourable members. I suppose the opposition's general gripe, because they had very little to say about the bill itself, was an attack on the government and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) on general health policies. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), hardly said anything about the bill but actually proceeded along those lines. It is not possible to reply to everything that he said, and I am sure the minister will in due course deal with some of the issues which he has raised. They are not directly relevant to this particular legislation. But simply coming into this House and uttering certain generalisations is not effective criticism. It is not criticism that anyone is going to take seriously. If the shadow minister has any concrete concerns, he should raise those concrete concerns by reference to facts, and not simply after discussions with some of his Liberal colleagues, especially Liberal health ministers in the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the two relevant issues that he raised, as I said, the minister has already put into place a number of very important programs. I am referring here to hospital waiting times and the issues surrounding private health insurance. It is a bit rich to have the shadow minister trying to lecture us about things like hospital waiting times when we have a situation where several of the state governments that are controlled by conservatives, controlled by their forces, are actually dramatically cutting back expenditure and cutting back the provision of services in health, especially in relation to public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience that we have had with the Kennett government in Victoria has been appalling. On the one hand, the minister concerned, Marie Tehan, lectures us about health insurance while, on the other hand, her arrangements in relation to hospitals have brought about dramatic cutbacks in the provision of public hospitals in Victoria&mdash;something which is recognised not only by the Labor Party but by the newspapers and a whole range of independent observers in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the response of the Kennett government when these claims have been made? It has virtually abused those people who have made the claims rather than dealt with the issue. Mr Kennett finally found that this approach was not working and, during Christmas and New Year, he went around visiting all the public hospitals in Victoria, trying to chat to people about how concerned he was&mdash;not about additional money, not about the fact that he had made all those cutbacks&mdash;as if that was going to reassure them or create better hospitals in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition wants to talk seriously about health policy and the delivery of health services, why does it not begin by having a chat to those conservative state health ministers who have disgracefully attacked health, one of the basic human needs of our society? We do not hear much even from the shadow minister; we certainly do not hear the Leader of the Opposition telling Mr Kennett, Mr Court or any of the other conservative Premiers that the cutbacks in health ought to be reconsidered. Then opposition members say that the problems of hospital queues, for example, are simply a matter for the federal government, when we have put into place a whole range of health initiatives and continue to do so. When the state governments misuse those initiatives and do not put the money to the intended purposes, that is a bit much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister also raised the issue of immunisation. He claimed that the immunisation program was not succeeding and that we were not doing enough. He had raised this matter with the minister's office, which arranged for a briefing for him by the department on the matter. Notwithstanding that briefing, he came into the House and tried to make some kind of political capital on the issue of immunisation. He raised questions about the number of people involved, the shortfalls in immunisation, for example, as if the government is not aware of it and not doing anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we are establishing a very important register to try to determine the extent of immunisation for different illnesses among particular groups of children. We are trying to set up a comprehensive register of children's immunisation records in order to do even more to ensure that they are. What is wrong with that? He says that this is a token measure. That is nonsense. It is a very important initiative which will be followed through to ensure that those groups of children that have been discovered as having missed out will be immunised. The register is not a token gesture; it is a very important part of a process of systematically dealing with this issue. We reject that general attack from the shadow minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Human Services and Health has shown a great awareness of this whole area of preventative health. Since she became minister we have taken up a whole range of preventative health matters that the states have failed to take up and we have taken up matters which have not been taken up previously by the Commonwealth. Despite this, the shadow minister claims that these initiatives are to account for nought. That is very unfair criticism of the minister, and it is certainly not backed by any facts or by any significant argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He mentioned that there are 400 goals and targets in health and then he said that, according to a discussion that he had had with Professor Peter Baume, only one of those targets is going to be met. I do not know where he gets that idea from, but this government is in the business of meeting its targets. We are always being criticised by the opposition, which claims that we will not meet our targets. For example, we were criticised at the time of the last election when we promised 500,000 additional jobs. The opposition claimed that we would not meet that target. In fact, we have met our target in two years instead of three years and we are exceeding our employment target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we make commitments in relation to goals and targets in health by the year 2001, we will meet those goals and targets. It is not just empty rhetoric; we are committed. If, as can be the case when we have such a range of targets, we encounter a situation where we find specific problems, specific blockages or specific impediments, we are not going to sit on our hands; we are going to overcome those problems and impediments because we are determined to achieve those outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister made all sorts of generalised criticisms of the government's health policy, but he mentioned absolutely nothing about what the opposition intend to do in health policy and program implementation. He said nothing about what they intend to do on the key issues, even the ones that he referred to. He said nothing about how the opposition intend to make arrangements with the states&mdash;because health involves extensive policy negotiations with the states. There was nothing about the opposition's spending commitments in the health area. There was absolutely nothing in policy terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How serious are we to take the kinds of criticisms that he makes? We are looking forward to when the opposition actually announce something. The only thing that we know about their health policy is that they now agree with our policy on Medicare, or at least they say they do. The fact that most of the Australian population does not believe them is another matter. Why would anyone believe them? At every election since 1983 they have opposed the fundamental universal principles of the Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When John Howard was Leader of the Opposition previously he was opposed to Medicare. However, there has now been some kind of conversion by his party colleagues. Why has there been a conversion? Is it because they sincerely believe in the principles of Medicare? No. Is it because they have finally been persuaded of the social justice aspects of Medicare? No. Notwithstanding the opposition's continuing attacks on Medicare over all those years, the Australian population still supports Medicare in a very big way. Therefore, the opposition have taken the view that, if they are going to have any hope of winning the next election, they had better rid themselves of their opposition to Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this shallow reason&mdash;not an embracing of the fact that the Australian people and the Australian Labor Party were correct on the Medicare issue, but simply for a shallow, narrow, political reason&mdash;they are going to try to tell people that they accept Medicare and especially the bulk-billing aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know about the links between the Australian Medical Association and the opposition. Are we really to believe that, if the opposition were to be elected, the AMA, after its constant, systematic attacks on key aspects of Medicare, is going to say to the opposition, `We've helped you get elected, but now we don't want you to do anything about changing the nature of Medicare'? You can be sure that if the opposition was to be elected there would be enormous pressure from the AMA and other interest groups to change certain key elements of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would the Australian people believe that the opposition, with their total lack of commitment to the social justice principles of Medicare over all those years, are going to withstand this kind of pressure? The newfound enthusiasm by the opposition for Medicare is shallow and the Australian people will not believe them if they go forward and say, `We intend to retain Medicare as a key feature of our health policy.' We want to make this point to the Australian people&mdash;and we will in the election context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that we will do is point out the opposition's total failure to come out with any significant policy in the area of health. If they manage something before the election, we can be sure it is going to be full of generalisations without too much in the way of specific content, and when that is the case I can assure you that the Australian people will not be fooled by such generalised sweeteners in the area of health. They will be looking at the performance of the Liberal and National parties in the states&mdash;at what they have done with health when they have gained state government. That is what they will be looking at. And what they have done with health is outrageous, totally unacceptable, contrary to the principles of social justice and certainly very bad for ordinary Australians, especially low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us not hear any more of this cant and hypocrisy from the opposition. Let us see some commitment&mdash;if they have any&mdash;to real concrete policies. Then we are ready to debate those policies if they ever come up with them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988&mdash;the act&mdash;to implement budget decisions to increase student places and research funding. The costs of these initiatives will be offset by the reallocation of existing discretionary funds, reduction of pipeline places for Victoria, and refinements to the higher education contribution scheme, HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 federal budget decisions reflected in this bill demonstrate clearly that the government is maintaining its commitment to the development of a high quality and accessible higher education system. They also confirm the government's ongoing policy of no up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. They strengthen the government's commitment to HECS as the mechanism whereby Australian undergraduate students make an equitable contribution to the costs of their education. The changes in HECS build on the essential features of the scheme and bring forward revenue which will assist growth of the higher education sector without increasing the size of any student's HECS debt or reducing the thresholds at which repayments must commence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act sets out maximum amounts for grants to institutions. This bill amends the act to reflect changes in expenditure as a result of the budget initiatives to provide new places, additional research funds and the carry-forward of quality funds. The bill includes funding for 1997 and 1998. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide funding for 5,850 new higher education places, plus pipeline, in the years 1996 to 1998. These places will go to states with strong population growth and currently low participation rates. Queensland will be the major beneficiary of these new places; New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia will also receive some places. The higher education budget package provides for funding of growth in other states in 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian government has previously expressed fears that as many as 10,000 higher education places would be redistributed from Victoria to other states to address growing differences in higher education participation rates and population growth. The provision of extra places to Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia has, however, been achieved without any reduction in the existing funding level or number of places at any university. There will be a minor reallocation of some of the growth anticipated in Victoria but Victorian institutions will still experience small increases in both funds and places and participation and access rates in Victoria will remain significantly higher than in other states until at least 2003. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the act also increase the total funds available for research infrastructure to about $293 million over the 1996-1998 triennium. This represents an additional $109 million for research infrastructure. This reflects the government's consistent view that an adequate research infrastructure is crucial for universities to maintain their research and research training capacity at internationally competitive levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide an additional $40 million for competitive research grants to assist the nation to maintain and strengthen its research capabilities and to enhance the contribution made by research and scientific development to national economic and social goals. This funding will be made available through the Australian Research Council and is on top of the $350 million already committed for these purposes over the 1996-1998 triennium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a welcome boost to opportunities available for outstanding research students. From 1996 there will be an extra 100 Australian postgraduate awards on top of the 1,600 already available. In addition there will be five new postdoctoral fellowships making a total of 55 from 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments establish the higher education innovations program. This program amalgamates the national priority&mdash;reserve&mdash;fund and the quality assurance program. The higher education innovations program will continue to provide incentives to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education as well as provide funding for specific innovative projects of national priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the initiatives outlined are achieved without any net additional expenditure and without introducing up-front fees for Australian undergraduate students. A vital element in this package is a set of refinements to HECS which bring forward revenue but do not increase the size of an individual's HECS debt. It is only by making these changes that the government is able to deliver substantial improvements in the higher education sector without recourse to the easy, but fiscally irresponsible, course of increasing overall government expenditure. One such refinement introduces an extra incentive for early repayment of HECS debts by allowing a 15 per cent discount on voluntary payments of $500 or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative introduces a voluntary option whereby HECS debtors can elect to repay their debt at a lower threshold and receive a 10 per cent discount. If HECS debtors elect to take up the option, they will make a commitment to repay their accumulated HECS debt at two per cent of assessable income when they are above a specified threshold&mdash;$20,000 in 1995-96&mdash;but below the first compulsory threshold&mdash;$27,674 in 1995-96. Their outstanding HECS debt will then be reduced by 10 per cent. This change will not be mandatory. A person choosing to take up the offer will lodge an election form with the Australian Taxation Office, which will `trigger' the discount and repayments when the person falls within the specified income range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives build on the essential features of the HECS scheme. They not only benefit the Commonwealth through earlier repayment of the HECS debts, but provide a significant benefit to the HECS debtor by introducing discounts in the size of their HECS debt.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has created a more flexible, accessible and dynamic higher education system and is committed to introducing policies that make further improvements. The government, however, believes that its policies for access to publicly funded higher education should meet, first and foremost, the needs of Australian citizens and those who have demonstrated a long-term commitment to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with this, the act amends the HECS provisions so that New Zealand citizens, and Australian permanent residents of three years standing or more who have not become Australian citizens, pay their HECS contribution up-front at enrolment. They will also have no further access to the open learning deferred payment scheme&mdash;OLDPS. Those students who have had their application for citizenship approved by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs may continue to defer their HECS and OLDPS contributions. This will ensure that students who have had a citizenship application approved but who may have to wait some months to attend a citizenship ceremony will not be financially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with other changes to HECS, the revenue brought forward as a result of this change will be used to fund additional higher education student places. The discount on mandatory up-front HECS payments is removed by these amendments. Under HECS, students who pay their contribution up-front at enrolment receive a discount of 25 per cent on their payment. This provides an incentive to pay up-front. This is not appropriate for those students who are precluded from deferring their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure relates to the provision of HECS exemption scholarships for teachers. These scholarships were introduced in 1989 to support a greater degree of professional development among teachers. Since that time, the government has introduced a new, more flexible $60 million national professional development program which addresses much of the same objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this initiative, and in light of the priority to provide additional undergraduate opportunities, the $4.8 million previously allocated to teacher HECS exemption scholarships will be reallocated to help create student places. In future, Commonwealth support for the professional development of teachers will be provided solely through the national professional development program. As the scholarship program will cease from the end of 1995, there will be no need for a provision in the act exempting scholarship holders from HECS liability, and the act will be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently under HECS there are three rates of repayment&mdash;three per cent, four per cent and five per cent of taxable income&mdash;depending on the debtor's level of taxable income. As part of the 1995 budget, the government is introducing four additional repayment rates, of 3.5 per cent, 4.5 per cent, 5.5 per cent and six per cent of HECS repayment income. The 3.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent rates are intermediate repayment rates and operate in a range between existing threshold levels. The 5.5 per cent and six per cent rates are additional repayment rates being set above the existing maximum threshold level. These additional repayment thresholds will return revenue to the Commonwealth at a faster rate without increasing the size of the HECS debt for individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to the act also redefines taxable income for HECS assessment purposes. From 1 July 1996, if a HECS debtor's taxable income has been reduced by a net rental loss&mdash;commonly referred to as `negative gearing'&mdash;then for HECS assessment purposes the amount of rental loss claimed will be added to the debtor's taxable income. For income earned in income year 1996-1997, and in subsequent income years, HECS assessable income will be used to determine whether or not a HECS debtor is required to make a compulsory repayment against their HECS debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a principle underlying HECS that students in publicly funded higher education places should be expected to make a contribution towards the cost of their tuition when, and only when, they have the financial capacity to do so. It is the government's intention that, by instituting this budget measure, those with the financial capacity to repay their HECS debt but who are in a position to minimise their income by claiming rental loss in their individual tax return will no longer be able to avoid making repayments on their HECS contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I stress that this bill presents a very tightly integrated package of measures which provides for growth in student places where they are needed, enhances research funds and postgraduate scholarships, does not alter the fundamental elements of HECS nor require reallocation of any existing student places, and does not increase overall government outlays. This package, or `cocktail' as it has become known in the higher education sector, was developed following extensive consultations with the higher education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated at the time the budget was handed down, any attempt to unravel this package or to introduce amendments which reduce revenue raising aspects will mean that the government is forced to reconsider its announcement of additional places allocated to Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Alternatively, the government will have to consider the reallocation of existing places from other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this package, the government has responded positively and quickly to the resource needs of the higher education sector with both new policy and effective savings without cutting the overall funds available to higher education. This bill underscores this government's commitment to the provision of opportunities for all Australians to have access to higher education; access which is dependent on academic merit and ability, not on the capacity to pay. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the house. </PARA>

Members will recall that that delegation comprised the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), Senator Bourne and me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation visited eight countries in quick succession: Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Austria. As you know, I had to leave the delegation after the first week in order to attend the South Pacific Forum in Papua New Guinea and the member for Chifley, Mr Price, who is the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, led the delegation in my absence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This visit took place as a result of the upswelling of outrage among Australians at France's decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific. All Australians are appalled at the decision of President Chirac to ignore world opinion and to break the moratorium on testing which was introduced by his predecessor, President Mitterrand. This decision shows complete disregard for the feelings of those living in this region who are deeply concerned about the environmental impacts of the testing over the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians do not accept that these tests are either defensible or necessary and in all sorts of ways the Australian people have given expression to their anger on this issue. We have sent delegations to France, we have made protests, we have taken action in a number of international forums and we have given the French government no comfort whatsoever on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did this delegation set out to do? Our main goal was to convey to the parliaments, governments and peoples of Europe our determined opposition to nuclear testing. We wanted to encourage a more forthright stance on the part of France's European neighbours, as we know that the only way we will end nuclear testing is by building a unanimous international chorus of opposition to it&mdash;and the countries of Europe are particularly important in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wanted also to lobby for a resolution in the United Nations condemning all nuclear testings&mdash;a matter which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, is now pursuing in New York. As well as that, we wanted to urge support for a truly comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty which would ban all testing in all environments for all time. And, finally, we wanted to explain carefully the reasons for our position, to make clear that our disagreement with France was confined to one issue and one issue only, namely, the issue of nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite surprised at some of the misinformation which had crept into the public mind in Europe on this issue. For example, I was asked by one television interviewer in France why it was that the Australian government was funding Greenpeace's activities! It is a curious but unfortunate fact that from the distant vantage point of Europe it is easy to depict the Australian government as responsible for a variety of protest actions, some of which are illegal. In fact, we were in Paris at the time of the riots in Papeete and I am sure that in the eyes of some there was the idea that the Australian government was somehow involved in those protests. Of course the government was not and it does not condone illegal protest activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to report that the delegation achieved its principal objectives to a very substantial degree. We had some 37 meetings with government ministers, parliamentary committees, other parliamentarians and relevant figures and bodies such as the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency. We held press conferences and we gave media interviews in each country to pursue our goal of raising public awareness of Australia's position. As well as that, the delegation took part in a video conference from Stockholm with the foreign relations committee of the Finnish parliament. The delegation also attended part of the opening of oral pleadings in New Zealand's action in the International Court of Justice against French testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The countries which we visited were very deliberately selected and in all but three countries our interlocutors were very receptive to our representations. In those countries our discussions focused on the ways in which we could work together to advance our shared objectives. In two other countries&mdash;Germany and the United Kingdom&mdash;public opinion is running strongly against renewed testing, but for various reasons the response of governments has been disappointingly quiet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those places we were given a polite and attentive hearing but it was clear that there was a reluctance to take our views on board, or for that matter the views of their own constituencies, on this nuclear testing issue. Nevertheless, it was pleasing that, after our visits there, when the first test actually took place, both the German Foreign Minister and the leader of the British opposition issued statements which advanced, very considerably, their public positions on the issue. For that reason, and as a result of the continuing pressure that we are keeping up, I believe the chance of further movement by these countries is considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to France fell into a category of its own. But even there we were very pleased by the access we were given to senior ministers, including the Minister for Defence, Monsieur Millon, the Minister for Overseas Territories, Monsieur De Peretti, and the Minister for Aid, Monsieur Godfrain. A meeting with the French foreign minister was scheduled but had to be cancelled at the last minute because of an urgent international meeting on Bosnia which Monsieur de Charette had to attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our discussions were forthright and robust but were held in a calm atmosphere. The French ministers explained the reasons for their government's decision. For our part, we very clearly put Australia's position on the issue to the French. We went through one by one the reasons advanced by the French side, pointing out that their arguments in favour of testing were based on false premises. For example, arguments about reliability of the nuclear weapons might make sense to a mathematician or a defence scientist but, in the real world, no potential aggressor against France would stake its chances on the possibility that French nuclear missiles would not work. Given that 200-odd French tests so far have been successful, the chance that a first weapon used in anger would not go off is not one that an aggressor would be likely to take. And if the first one did not go off, what about the second or the third?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also attempted to explore further the possibility that France might obtain the data to construct the computer simulation programs it is looking for from other nuclear powers, such as the United States. That is a matter I have raised on a number of occasions before, including before President Chirac's election. I regret to say that the French authorities do not seem interested in the idea&mdash;for one reason or another, it has not appealed to France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took particular pains to explain to the French ministers that Australia was not attempting to deprive France of its nuclear capability. We reiterated that Australia's opposition to testing being carried out by China equalled our opposition to that being carried out by France. We took issue time and again with the view that Australia was opposed to France's place in the Pacific or that the government was encouraging economic boycotts of French goods. We pointed out that neither position is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that these discussions did not in full measure yield the results that we might have wished. On the need for France to continue testing, we did not persuade our interlocutors to accept our point of view. But I am sure that they do now understand our position much better, even if they do not agree with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certain, too, that an important part of the overall success of the delegation was the broad participation in it of all major parties represented in this parliament. I would like to pay tribute to the contribution of delegation members from the government, the opposition and the Australian Democrats. The fact that all the major political parties in the parliament were represented helped us to reinforce the impact we made by underlining the fact that opposition to nuclear testing is shared across the political spectrum in this country. It was particularly useful, when meeting ministers and MPs from the conservative side of politics, for example in the UK, that they should hear our messages conveyed by people such as Mr Downer or Mr Sinclair who, I note, are present in the chamber. It was useful that they should hear our messages conveyed by people who, on other issues, would normally be expected to be on the same side of the argument as they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where do we go from here? The campaign is by no means over. Another delegation from this parliament, led by the President of the Senate, is currently in Europe on a visit to the European parliament, to Spain and the OECD. This delegation will be raising the same issues we did as part of its agenda. As well as that, we are continuing to make our voice heard in international forums. Australia is actively involved in negotiations on a draft resolution for debate in the United Nations General Assembly. We very much hope that the resolution will gain the widest possible support as it will be an important way of giving expression to the international community's condemnation of nuclear testing. It is a large part of Senator Evans's agenda for his current visit to the United Nations in New York. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it now seems inevitable, though I say it with reluctance, that more tests will occur, but certainly not as many as we first thought and feared. Nor is it clear to the government that any further bilateral action that Australia could take would make President Chirac change his mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe, however, that the storm of opposition which has been aroused over this issue&mdash;and of which our delegation was part&mdash;has had a measurable impact in France. One has only to look at France's welcome acceptance of a zero yield comprehensive test ban treaty&mdash;a concept which has been resolutely promoted by Australia&mdash;as well as the statement made by President Chirac recently, which clearly leaves open the possibility that the number of tests by France will be reduced. There are also indications that the duration of the testing period will be shortened. So, overall, I am optimistic that our sustained campaign of public opposition will reinforce this trend, and that we will soon see a definitive end to nuclear testing in this part of the world and, indeed, throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the delegation, I conclude by expressing my thanks to the officers of the Parliamentary Relations Office and the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;in Canberra and overseas&mdash;who, in their unfailingly  helpful and efficient way, put together the arrangements for our visit and made an important contribution to its success.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the idea of a delegation to visit European countries and lobby on French nuclear testing&mdash;I think it was on what is sometimes known as Hiroshima Day&mdash;I was glad to hear the Prime Minister's statement, and was certainly one of the first to publicly welcome it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken the view for quite some time that, if anybody is to persuade the French to desist from nuclear testing, it is the European Union. France, when it made the decision to proceed with nuclear testing, had obviously made the calculation that Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific countries would object, and that France could live with that. What the French did not estimate was the strength of protest that would emerge from within Europe itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of French foreign policy are France's relationships within the European Union and the whole structure of European unity itself. I thought the idea of our going to various European countries, putting our case to them and trying to persuade them to take a strong stand against France resuming nuclear testing was a constructive one. In fact, I said so in a press release that I put out on 23 July, which was some time before the Prime Minister made his statement that such a delegation should go. Bearing all that in mind, the delegation was not only a good idea&mdash;given the limited prospects we had of persuading the French to reverse their decision&mdash;but also fairly effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) pointed out in his statement, there were really three messages that we wanted to get across. The first concerned our opposition to French nuclear testing itself and the fact that all Australians are opposed to France's decision to resume nuclear testing. It is not an issue that has divided the political parties in Australia&mdash;parties which are so divided on so many issues&mdash;and it was important that people in Europe properly understood that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put our arguments to the Europeans, very much emphasising the non-proliferation arguments. We emphasised the fact that France had signed up to the non-proliferation treaty review conference, on the grounds that it would exercise utmost restraint, and then as soon as the ink was dry on the paper went off&mdash;as did the Chinese, for that matter&mdash;and resumed nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the enormous difficulties that were involved in persuading many developing countries and many non-aligned countries to sign up to the MPT review and extension conference, and given the difficulties involved and the amount of diplomatic capital that was invested in getting those countries to sign up, it was a matter of some outrage that the French should treat that process with the contempt that they clearly did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We argued quite effectively. In Europe there was widespread agreement with the proposition that, at a time when we should be arguing for non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the French and the Chinese, by resuming nuclear testing, were doing nothing but give comfort to the nuclear threshold states. We certainly put the environmental arguments, but the evidence of the environmental damage caused by French nuclear testing is equivocal. There is a shortage of data available from the French themselves. The environmental argument will need to be developed when more data is made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, these arguments were very well received in just about every country we visited, with the obvious exception of France. In the case of the United Kingdom, I believe that privately the British government sympathises with the arguments that we have put, but they are not prepared to say so publicly. The British are themselves a nuclear weapons state, and they do not feel that it would do much to advance their important relationship with France if they were to criticise the French on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to think that strategy by the British government is the wrong strategy, and it is probably one of the very few things on which I would agree with the British Labor Party. I was glad that the leader of the British opposition was prepared to put out a press release condemning the resumption of nuclear testing by France. What the opposition says, the government here would say may not matter very much&mdash;that is what they tell us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Price interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they think the British opposition is different because it is Labor. The Australian Labor Party are really profound; there is real depth to them! The second argument that we put was that we wanted a successful conclusion to the comprehensive test ban treaty with a zero threshold. Again, that argument was very well received everywhere we went, including France. The French have said that they will sign up on those terms to the CTBT, once their testing program is complete. There is no question of the support in Europe for the comprehensive test ban treaty and the zero threshold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Kingdom was the one country where I wondered whether we would get unequivocal support. When Sir Patrick Mayhew, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&mdash;who, I think, is the fifth in the British cabinet hierarchy&mdash;visited Canberra last week, I raised these issues with him, including my disappointment at the stance that the British government has taken on French nuclear testing. I am glad to say that he told me that not only would Britain sign up to the CTBT, but it would definitely do so on the basis of a zero threshold. That was the first confirmation I had heard from a minister, although I believe that the British ambassador to the committee on disarmament had made those points. It was good to see that response from the minister, and in terms of that objective we were very successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third objective was to ensure that the momentum of protest against what the French were doing was maintained. We argued that the way to maintain this was to get support for a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly and in the International Atomic Energy Agency&mdash;the most important forum being the United Nations General Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the indications that we had were of at least in-principle support for some type of resolution. Amongst members of the European Union, there was some concern that they could be put in the position of voting against France in a forum such as the United Nations, and at a time when Europe is trying to develop a common foreign policy. But, as we pointed out to the Europeans, `The French didn't consult any of you when they made the decision to resume nuclear testing. You, yourselves, are not obliged to support the French on this issue. You are obliged to support your consciences and the principle of non-proliferation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that that message was well received and I would be very surprised if we did not win just about overwhelming support from European countries in the United Nations General Assembly. No doubt the British will not, no doubt the Germans will be nervous, but I think the majority of countries in Europe will support the resolution which is to be brought to the General Assembly. In terms of our three objectives, I think we did about as well as we could have hoped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say something about the meetings that we had with the French because they were of particular interest. As the minister pointed out, we met with Monsieur Millon, the French Defence Minister, and his officials. We also met with two other ministers: the Minister for Development Cooperation and the Minister for Overseas Territories. It is important to understand that we were very firm at those meetings. We put Australia's case very definitely and, if I could say so, very bluntly. But it is also very important to understand that, in responding, the French were always polite and civil and were prepared to go out of their way to meet with us and spend time with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made several points to the French over and above the simple points about our opposition to nuclear testing. One point we made was that we are not Francophobic: we are not anti-French and Australia is not an anti-French country. After all, as we pointed out&mdash;I think it might have been to the foreign affairs committee in the Belgian parliament&mdash;something like 30,000 Australians died in the First World War in helping to defend France. To accuse Australians of being somehow Francophobic is an absolute absurdity. We were able to make that point well and truly while we were in France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made it clear that we did not want to see the relationship descend to the level of a trade war. We made it clear that we were not arguing about the issue of the French presence in the South Pacific and that we were not arguing that France should withdraw from the South Pacific. The people of French Polynesia and the people of New Caledonia are entitled to self-determination, whether they are French colonies or not. If they want the present arrangements to remain in place, that is their decision and their right. It is not for us to be arrogantly telling those people that they would be much better off severing their ties with France. It is entirely a matter for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, although the French understood the sincerity of those types of remarks made by the minister, made by me and made by other members of the delegation, our position had already been somewhat undermined by the Prime Minister's statement on 9 August when he said, in response to some remarks by President Chirac which, admittedly, were rather inflammatory, `We gave up our colonialism in the 1970s. The French are still hanging on to their colonialism in the Pacific. Maybe the French should have a good look at themselves.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a very silly and ill-considered thing to say, because it was a statement that played into the hands of President Chirac and one that, in a sense, has embarrassed Australia. But the point is that, despite the Prime Minister's gaffe, the official position of the Australian government and of the Australian opposition is at variance with that view&mdash;and the Prime Minister, of course, has retreated from that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me finish my remarks about France by saying that our meetings with French ministers&mdash;I have said this already&mdash;were friendly and constructive, although there were obviously points of disagreement. Those meetings were held on a Thursday and a Friday. On the Sunday we were amazed to hear the vicious attack launched by President Chirac against Australia and Australian motives. President Chirac claimed that Australia provided no aid to the South Pacific at all. At the breakfast meeting with the Minister for Development Cooperation the minister talked about the need for Australia and France to cooperate more in their development assistance programs. How the President could have come out and made that claim, after such a meeting that we had with the Minister for Development Cooperation, I do not know. There is clearly a breakdown in communications in the French government between President Chirac and the rest of his ministry, or between President Chirac's office and the rest of his ministry, and that is something that I would have thought that the French government could closely examine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister made the point in his speech and in France that one of the things the French should be doing should be looking at sharing data with the United States rather than testing to obtain more data. That was a constructive proposal. I remind the minister that, when we suggested that in an amendment to a motion in the House of Representatives earlier in the year, he said it was a pettifogging suggestion and voted against it, which was a pity; I did not think there was any need to vote against a constructive suggestion. Nevertheless, I was glad to hear the minister take up something that I thought was constructive, which he used to think was pettifogging but which he now thinks is constructive. It is a wonderful thing to see the Labor Party evolve, to follow the lead of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude on a serious matter. We had a meeting in Vienna, after the minister had returned, with the International Atomic Energy Agency and a subsequent meeting, after we had returned, with the Australian Safeguards Office, at which initially some alarm was expressed by the delegation that the IAEA and the ASO were not able to guarantee that Australian uranium could never be used in French nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am satisfied that that issue has been resolved, by information provided to me by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) that the French no longer produce fissile material; they no longer produce material that can be used in nuclear testing. So there is no question that Australian material can now be used for French nuclear testing. I thank Senator Evans and the minister at the table for ensuring that we were able to obtain that information, which has been constructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a successful delegation. I thank the staff at the various embassies&mdash;the ambassadors and the officials who helped us. It was a really productive exercise, and it shows that bipartisanship, when it is heading in the right direction, can work quite successfully. </PARA>

I will pick up on the last part of the contribution of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) by saying that it is always worth while, when we have the opportunity, to show that members on both sides of the House work very constructively in the nation's interests. We do this not just in this delegation but in other work of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to our delegation leader, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). It was very useful that he is such a fluent French speaker. I did not understand all that he was saying in French, but most of it seemed to be getting a very good reception. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, most members understand that this delegation was put together at great haste and it required some considerable effort by our overseas posts. I would like to report back, as the minister has, that none failed and indeed all did an exceedingly good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This delegation was one of those things where it was good to be honoured&mdash;a privilege, actually&mdash;and I would like to thank the House for that opportunity. But it was a privilege to represent something that was deeply felt by ordinary Australians and gave the sense that you were actually going to accomplish something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister said, our mission, as much as we might have liked it, was not to stop French testing. Unfortunately, that was not possible&mdash;indeed, the first bomb went off while we were over there&mdash;but it was to inform European parliaments and ministers of the Australian and South Pacific attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was based on the strategy that whilst ordinary Australians had reacted to this French decision in a most remarkable way, and that was mirrored in New Zealand and in many of the small and smallest countries in the South Pacific, as strong as that protest was, it really was not going to make one iota of difference as far as the French were concerned&mdash;the real leverage on the French government was France's European partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point at this early stage in my contribution that we have nothing against the French people. We are not against France, as the minister said. We object only to one decision and that is the French government's decision to resume testing. Indeed, many Australians should remember that a majority of the French people themselves are opposed to this testing, as are overwhelming numbers of people in the European nations that we visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister pointed out some of the gross misconceptions. He pointed out that he was questioned whether Australia was funding Greenpeace. There was the suggestion that, really, Australia's opposition was a clever marketing campaign to promote Australian wines&mdash;an absurd suggestion. There was the suggestion that we had banned all French goods in Australia&mdash;equally absurd. Then there was the suggestion, as the minister said, that we were really trying to get France out of the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister made one point repeatedly, it was that Australia, since 1988, had welcomed the constructive role of France in the South Pacific, had worked closely with France and looked forward to doing so. However, I am drawn to comment on this issue of the French colonies. As a Labor member, I have to say that the issue of self-determination for the French colonies is one for them and for France. But if any country has reopened that issue, it is not Australia, it is not New Zealand and it is not the South Pacific countries. It is the action of the French President in deciding to recommence tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I do not envisage Australia raising this issue in the United Nations, it certainly will attract the attention of a number of countries and I would be surprised if this issue is not raised in the UN committee for decolonisation. If so, France would only have one person to blame and that would be itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst in France, again as the minister said, we put vigorously the idea that rather than continuing on this path of testing which is so infuriating world opinion and isolating France, why not look at using computer simulation? Why not look at adapting the technology used by both the US and the UK?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The French minister gave two responses: one was the compatibility of the weapons; and the second was a national consideration. The second really was that France wants everything about its nuclear deterrent totally French&mdash;not one iota non-French. This is an ideological position very difficult to overcome. On the compatibility argument, there are real grounds to move there, although I accept that there are some problems. But I also have to confess to the House that I am not convinced that the French reasons for testing are entirely valid, that is, the obsolescence of some of the weaponry and wanting to maintain its reliability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, some of the tests can be categorised as testing new weapons, and not force de suasion or not a deterrent but, as these are for submarines, actually projecting power. Of the attempts by the French to try to cause a distraction from overwhelming opposition was this notion of Europeanising the deterrent. I am pleased to say in the other countries we visited that this concept was rejected out of hand. In fact, for some of the newer members of the EU, it has really placed in question this whole idea of having a European defence. In some ways I think that is a backward movement, but it is seen for what it is, a smokescreen or a device to deflect attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say I was disappointed at the German reaction&mdash;that is, the French having insisted that we see no minister in that country&mdash;although we did see the head of their equivalent to our foreign affairs department. I am disappointed that Germany, a country in such close cooperation and partnership with France, for historical reasons felt constrained from perhaps publicly making a more vigorous opposition to the resumption of testing as they have made privately. I think Germany's leadership position in Europe really demands more than it has shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the countries we visited, the UK disappointed me most. We saw a very junior minister, but we got no comfort whatsoever. On reflection, we got a better justification for the French testing in the UK than I think the French themselves gave. I do not want to detract from the bipartisan nature and record of achievement of the delegation, but permit me to wryly observe that I believe the Queen of Australia seems to be having a difference of opinion with the Queen of England on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, the isolation that France enjoys and that the UK government has in Europe on this issue may change with the forthcoming Commonwealth heads of government conference. I hope that the UK will listen to the very vigorous views that I suspect will be put by all countries to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only realised later that I had one regret about our visit to Brussels. When we were in Denmark we were pleased to be able to speak with the ministry for the environment, the minister apologising for not being able to be there. They had quite some confidence in the EU commissioner for the environment who, as you may be aware, is already acting within the EU context to ask France to provide justification for testing. I am only sorry that whilst in Brussels we did not meet with the commissioner herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quietly confident that we all may have underestimated the power of the EU commissioner. Either way, if the commissioner decides in favour of France, then it remains a possibility that a European country can take the matter to the European court and get justice there or, hopefully, the EU commissioner herself may be able to bring down a decision that will stop this testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the lessons I learned, as they say, is that the world is a village. Ordinary people in Australia are reflecting their anger and concern about the testing in France, but ordinary people in Europe are also reflecting their anger. It was a real delight in Denmark to meet and speak with some young students who had cycled all the way from Denmark to France as a tangible measure of their protest. We were not able to visit all the countries we would otherwise have liked to, and no slights were intended, but to meet some young students from Norway&mdash;who were going to spend the whole night and morning getting back to Norway to go to work the following day&mdash;was indeed a pleasure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Sweden we were able to speak via videoconferencing in the parliament to our Finnish counterparts. As much as we like to think that we are sometimes at the wrong end of the world, we already have the ability to video conference through the audio and video facilities in the House. All we need to do is spend the extra money to get the equipment which would allow us to speak to our Austrian counterparts or to our UK counterparts, et cetera.

I think this delegation has shown that we can accomplish quite some good in a very bipartisan way on an issue that is of prime concern to ordinary Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are not many occasions in the passage of political events in this country of ours where there is a bipartisan approach. More often, fortunately, they occur in the consideration of external affairs rather than domestic affairs. But in this particular instance both external affairs and domestic affairs were linked with the delegation led by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), whom I commend both for the statement that he has made to the House and for his leadership of the mission. His facility with French certainly gave him a capacity to respond on French media to the real audience that we sought to target&mdash;the French people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we understand the particular climate within which the decision has been taken by France. It is important to understand the extent to which, with a new president and a new government, there was a feeling by some&mdash;certainly by the president and his prime minister&mdash;that this decision to resume testing in some way established a counterbalance within Europe which might have been seen to offset the expanded economic strength of an enlarged Germany, the testing being designed to re-establish the supremacy of France within an expanded European Community. In any event, it left a feeling that an agenda was being played out by France that ignored totally the feelings of the French community and certainly the feelings of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early in our visit the minister drew reference to a cartoon that we all might recall which best highlights the circumstances of the distance between metropolitan France and Mururoa Atoll, which is the part of the south-east Pacific where the tests took place. He referred to a cartoon showing a globe of the world and a French general saying to President Chirac, `See, Mon Generale, it will not hurt. You push the button here and it goes bang down here.' He was talking about the other side of the world. It is because France is on the other side of the world and because, without doubt, the decision to resume nuclear testing was related to attitudes and perceptions in France of her role within Europe and of President Chirac's conception of his role within French history that I think the decision to send an all parliamentary delegation was certainly worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I will come back to the point we reached at the end of our deliberations, in opening I would like to say that the mission was worth while. I commend the minister and the member for Chifley (Mr Price), who took over after the minister left, for being able to accomplish as much as we did. It was a mission on which we knew from the very beginning we would be frustrated by our inability to stop the French testing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the actual countries we visited and the discussions we held are concerned, much of what has been done has already been catalogued by my colleagues, and I do not intend to repeat their remarks. There are some particular occasions, though, that I think are worthwhile re-emphasising. The first is that, while it is true that in Germany we did not meet a minister, we did meet a senior official within the department of foreign affairs. We did without doubt get the feeling that the public approach to France by Germany&mdash;by the German government and the chancellor&mdash;was quite different from their private approach. Indeed, we were very pleased to see the German foreign minister coming out, after the first French test, with quite a strong public condemnation of the resumption of testing. We were assured that privately at least, within the forums of the community and the bilateral contact that exists, the Germans had been more forthright than they were prepared to be publicly&mdash;even with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within Germany, as within every other country of Europe, there seemed to be two layers of resistance. The first and the most notable was within the community at large. The community right throughout Europe&mdash;in part because of the publicity attracted by our visit and the actions of Greenpeace and others&mdash;certainly had concentrated their minds on the consequences of the resumption of French testing. An aspect that each of us stressed was that it was not a matter of Australia condemning France on any issue other than on that one particular focus: resumption of underground testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that by doing that, not only were we able to maintain the momentum of bipartisan representation but we were also able to assist in the momentum of concern in that wider European community. We all recognised that the particular relationship between France and Germany has been quite instrumental in the development and formation of the European Community. It was because of that focal relationship between Germany and France in the community that we saw it was important that we visited more than one country and helped to ensure that the community's views were reflected in the consciousness of the status of the French decision and reflected back on those who took the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the visit that also impressed me, which certainly from afar I had not registered, was the changing character of the European Community as a result of its expansion. Three of the countries we visited&mdash;or two we visited and one whose foreign affairs committee we spoke to by virtue of a teleconference&mdash;have recently joined the European Community. While little has been said, I do not think enough attention has been given to the impact on the decisions and the function of the European Community as a result of its expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Austria, Sweden and Finland recently joined the community as relatively smaller countries, in contrast to Germany in particular and the economy of France, there is no doubt that the momentum towards not only a common currency but progressively towards a common foreign policy and a common defence policy I think is now more unlikely to proceed<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">than perhaps previously might have been thought. One of the significant reasons why it is not going to proceed is not that those new countries have joined the European Community but that France has recommenced nuclear testing in the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the French did not look towards that consequence during their discussions. Indeed, one of the other aspects of that consequence is, as several members have mentioned, that while France was calling on her European colleagues not to dissent from her status on an issue that she said was within her sovereign responsibility and was not something that was domestically within the concern of other countries, when it was mentioned that the French did not consult with the other members of the European Community prior to recommencing the nuclear test program, they reacted in a way which showed how frustrated they are and that, if there is to be a common European foreign policy, it need not automatically be that of France. That is a concept which the French find a little hard to accept but it is a concept which now is filtering through simply because the French have ignored that very consultative mechanism which they were largely instrumental in writing into the whole of the concept in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fallout in a way that the French did not expect. It is in part a product of our visit and the fact that publicity was attracted to the locality of the testing and the fact that there had been no consultation. Perhaps that is why this resistance developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been mention of our interview with David Davis, a junior minister within the British government. Like others of my colleagues, I was very disappointed in the approach taken by the government of the United Kingdom. It was only in the United Kingdom, in Germany and amongst one group of French liberals in the Belgian committee of foreign affairs that we found any resistance at all to the idea that there should be a united approach to condemn France for the resumption of nuclear testing. As the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) said, David Davis gave a greater justification for the resumption of French testing than even the French themselves. I found that most disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all understand that France has been overrun successfully over the last 100 years. It is not that we do not understand France's strong commitment to either force de frappe or force de suasion, whichever term you like to use. Indeed, as the minister and others have said, we not only understand it; we endorse it. We recognise that the French  feel vulnerable. They do not want again to be overrun by another country. That is not only a natural feeling for France; it is a natural feeling for any country. So the circumstances around their force de frappe and force de suasion were not matters that we canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we canvassed was that there was no need for them to extend their nuclear capability by having a test in the first place. Having exploded the nuclear weapon, there was absolutely no reason for them to proceed in what they said were tests to establish the calibration procedures, which it has been suggested they could very easily attract from the United States. There has been some discussion about that today. Let it be said on record that I, amongst others, have raised this with the Americans. I have been assured that they have made offers to the French, even though the French and the advisers to Charles Millon, the French Minister for Defence, assured us that they had not been offered the necessary advice to allow them to develop their own computer testing processes. They said that, even if they had, `Our weapon is different.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fail to understand how any formula cannot be developed. Certainly when they have already had nearly 200 tests of their own you would think they would have the fundamental information. To my mind, the fact that the Americans were prepared to give them the additional information totally destroys the validity of their calibration requirements in future testing. As for obsolescence, as the minister said in his statement today, if the first weapon does not go off, the probability of the second going off is certainly far greater. They have shown that their first did go off. I certainly am most apprehensive about reports I have read that the whole thing is really about miniaturisation, about developing a new trigger mechanism, and certainly not just about obsolescence and calibration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there should be no doubt that whatever the explanation of the British, of David Davis, or of Charles Millon, the French Minister for Defence, and his advisers, from our point of view we do not accept that there is any longer any necessity for the continuation of the test program. It is important that the French, partly as a result of this discussion today and certainly hopefully as a result of the discussions that we had in Europe, should register the strength of our views and our feelings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I summarise by saying: where did we get to as a result of our visit? I know others have said it, but I think it is important to reiterate that Chirac's popularity has not declined peculiarly because we visited but because of the consequence of a recognition that nuclear testing is against the mood in the European Community. Our visit was no more than a factor in marshalling and mounting dissuasion within the countries of Europe against the continuation of testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, it is particularly unfortunate that President Chirac has seen fit to refuse a visit to the Swedish Prime Minister and the Austrian Chancellor. I regard that as yet a further downward step in France's leadership of Europe. I find it quite incredible that, at an age when France is saying that we have an expanded Europe and we are going to be able to play a continued important role in the future, they should take decisions of that character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the arguments of Chirac himself are concerned, there is little doubt that he has little communication with his own ministers. As has been said, the discussions with each of his ministers&mdash;the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Development Cooperation and the Minister for Overseas Territories&mdash;were exactly the reverse of the statements he made on air on television on the Sunday following our visit. One wonders what sort of an agenda he was pursuing for that reason. There is only one focus of our objection: the resumption of nuclear testing and its continuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third real concern that we all had is where we go from here. CHOGM provides another forum for opposition. The resolution of the South Pacific Forum shows the strength of opinion of the South Pacific countries and New Zealand. One of our purposes was to try to ensure support for a United Nations resolution, which will be hopefully brought up immediately after the commemoration and celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. We hope that many countries will join with Australia towards a resolution which will really place a moratorium on further test bans until the comprehensive test ban treaty can be concluded. We hope that resolution will be universally supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, it is essential that the French understand that we hope that they will not only become a party to that comprehensive test ban treaty with a zero threshold&mdash;as they have said they will do, and as we hope will Britain and the United States&mdash;but also sign the protocols of the Treaty of Rarotonga. We trust that they will desist from further testing and recognise that the product of the decision by the French President has been very much to the detriment of France and not to its benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am left with a number of very strong impressions after spending two weeks in Europe on this Australian delegation. The first and most important and overwhelming is that France is totally isolated on this question. France stands alone in its actions in resuming nuclear tests. It has done enormous damage to its credibility and its standing both in Europe and throughout the international community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the other very strong impression I gained is that the French President and some of his chief advisers and strongest supporters are locked into a time warp. They still think we are in the 1970s. They do not understand that the world has moved on and that in the 1990s, in the post-Cold War era, the people of the world do not want nuclear weapons being expanded, developed and tested. They want the world's leaders to be removing, reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons. They do not want more nuclear tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third very strong impression I gained from our visit is that, thanks to Jacques Chirac, Australia's reputation in  Europe is at an all-time high. The people of Europe recognise that Australia has shown very strong international leadership on this question. They respect us greatly for the effort that we have put in in taking this question straight to the French. They respect the principled basis of our arguments. They understand that we are working on behalf of a lot of people. They respect the role that we have played in assisting those small nations in our region in the South Pacific who, as very small nations, do not have much of a voice themselves. We as a major nation in the South Pacific region have worked on their behalf as well. We have incredibly increased our reputation and support amongst the people of Europe because of the principled stand that we have taken on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a great honour to be involved in this delegation. I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for enabling it to occur and for the parliament for allowing me to be part of the delegation. As the only Queenslander on the delegation, I was pleased to be able to be a voice for the people of Queensland in Europe on this issue, because the people of Queensland have felt very strongly about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nuclear testing has been an issue that has affected us for a long time. The people of Queensland were very angry during the 1970s when the French atmospheric testing was carried out because a lot of the fallout was occurring in North Queensland. So there is very strong opposition in Queensland to French nuclear testing. Although these tests are now underground and do not have the same immediate impact on the environment that the atmospheric tests did, there is still a very strong feeling amongst the people of Queensland of great opposition to nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Again, it was a great opportunity for me to be a voice for the people of Queensland in France and in Europe on this question. So I thank the Prime Minister and the parliament for that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been on a couple of other parliamentary delegations. This one was quite unique in that we worked totally as a united team. The team consisted of members of the opposition, a Democrat senator and members of the government, but we were one voice. That had an enormous impact throughout Europe. It certainly had an impact on politicians who understand how Australia has a pretty vibrant and vigorous parliamentary system and how it is often very difficult to get two sides to join on an issue. We were there speaking as one voice, and we made a very effective team in doing that. That unity helped us to successfully get our message across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we were not able to end nuclear testing by the French. As much as we all would have liked that to have happened, we knew it was not going to be possible just from our visit, but I do believe we achieved a lot of our other aims. Our first and most important aim was to bring clarity back to the debate, to try to counter some of the arguments that the French media and French government spokespersons had been trying to peddle throughout Europe about other motivations behind Australia's campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very helpful that we were in Europe at the time President Chirac made two speeches about the French nuclear testing issue. Being in Europe, we were then able to talk to the media, the politicians and the people to counter some of the points that President Chirac made. We were very successful in that we very clearly identified our two strong objections&mdash;disarmament and the environment. None of the other baggage that President Chirac was trying to attach to us had any relevance or any basis in fact at all. The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) and other speakers here today have outlined how we managed to counter those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will gain a side benefit from the Chirac actions, but that was not our motivation. The fact is that Australian wine sales probably will improve in Europe. It is pretty good wine. That was not our motive. It is clear that the people of Europe, like the people of Australia, are angry about the French. They are using one of the few vehicles they have to express their view&mdash;that is, a consumer boycott of French goods&mdash;as a means of expressing their anger at the French government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were in Germany, we were told that French wine sales there had been cut by about 30 per cent. When we were in Sweden, we were told that sales of French cheese and French wines had been cut by over 50 per cent. While we were in Holland, a lot of shop windows and house windows around the streets of Amsterdam had posters saying `Boycott French wine'. I took a photo of one of those posters. It is not something that we have engineered; it is something that the people of Europe are doing themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not leading any official government boycott of goods because we do not believe that it is an appropriate way for a government to act, particularly the Australian government which has fought so long for so many years to get a free trade system in this world. We do not want to endanger those free trade systems by imposing individual political boycotts on particular products from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot stop the people of Australia or Europe from using one of the few opportunities they have to express a point of view&mdash;that is, to vote with their wallets and say, `I'm not going to spend my hard earned money on French products while the French keep doing these things in the world.' Another strong impression I gained while I was away was the overwhelming support from the Scandinavian people and governments for our position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited two Scandinavian countries and met with Scandinavian people and politicians. We received a strong level of support from those people. As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has indicated, the Scandinavians are new members of the European Union; yet they are some of the loudest and strongest in their condemnation of France. I think that is a brave stand to take because France is a powerful economy within the European Union. As new members of the European Union they probably run some risk in asserting their opinions that strongly. They were prepared to do so on a matter of principle, and that is what is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a couple of highlights for me on the trip. I would like to mention one. I had the opportunity while we were meeting with the French Minister for Defence, Mr Charles Millon, to present a petition on behalf of all members of the parliamentary Labor Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great opportunity we had, although it has not come to pass as part of our ongoing campaign, was a visit to the International Court of Justice in The Hague on the first day of the reopening of the New Zealand case. We were there to show our support for the New Zealand government in the reopening of their case. It was a great opportunity to visit the court and see the way in which it operates because it is the supreme international court. That was a great opportunity for me personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also received very strong support from the people of Austria. We had the great honour of meeting the chancellor of Austria. He has been the strongest European leader in his condemnation of the French. I congratulate him for the strength of his actions. Unfortunately, he has paid a price. He is now not allowed to go to France and meet with the French government. In my view, that demeans the French more than it does the Austrians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Austria are very anti-nuclear. They do not have nuclear power stations on their territory, although they probably receive a bit of power from France which is generated from nuclear power stations. They are all very anti-nuclear&mdash;anti-nuclear weapons and anti-nuclear power. They particularly felt the fallout from the Chernobyl accident of 10 years ago. Their people really do not want to be involved in the nuclear industry or on the military side of it at all. That is why they were so strong in their campaign against this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been stated before, our visit involved going to nine cities in 10 days. It was organised only three weeks prior to our departure. We received outstanding support from the embassies and the high commission in London. They did a wonderful job in organising a program for us as quickly they did. I thank the embassy staff, the ambassadors and the High Commissioner to Great Britain for their great work in setting up the visit. I also wish to thank Dr Janet Gardiner from the Australian embassy in Bonn, who accompanied us for the last seven or eight days. She did a great job too in supporting us and keeping us on track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I also thank the other members of the delegation for the work they did and for the opportunity to be with them and to share some of their experiences. I think that we worked very effectively as a team, led most ably by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs in the first week and by the member for Chifley (Mr Price) in the second week. They did a really good job in their leadership roles, and I appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a great honour to represent your country in other countries and to be able to put your country's case. We had a very specific and narrow agenda. I think we did a good job&mdash;if you don't mind me saying so&mdash;in putting Australia's case most effectively. We have continued to ensure that France is isolated. I think the end result is that France will not explode anywhere near eight tests. Because of the strength of international opinion, the number of tests will be down to three&mdash;or there may be a fourth one. I do not know how long France will be able to keep putting up with the mass of international protest against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advice to the French government is: stop now and learn from your mistakes. The people of the world do not want your bombs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cessation of nuclear testing and the signing of the comprehensive test ban treaty are the issues of the moment. Aside from the possibility of accidents, there are serious regional concerns about the long-term consequences to the marine environment. Countries of the South Pacific, like Australia and New Zealand, are opposed to testing in their region on both environmental and moral grounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not speaking today because I took part in the delegation led by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) but I am pleased that such a high profile delegation went from the parliament of Australia to Europe to convey Australia's opposition to French nuclear testing. At roughly the same time, an unofficial group of Australian members of parliament went with parliamentarians from other parts of the world to Papeete. Because it was not an official delegation I found myself paying my own way. But as I thought it was such an important issue to the people of my electorate and that I was, in every sense of the word, representing their views, I thought it was an important thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough for the French to say they will sign a comprehensive test ban treaty in the future. Deferring difficult issues cannot be tolerated, because those people in our electorates expect us to speak with meaning and act decisively. The issues that I am raising concerning these matters are not what the French government and their spokespeople have said&mdash;`a lot of Australians bashing the French'. Our argument is not with French people, whom other generations of Australians have fought with as allies; our argument is with the French government. I acknowledge that 61 to 62 per cent of French people themselves are opposed to nuclear testing and that 95 per cent of Australians are opposed to French nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not help being moved by the fact that when we were in the area where these tests were to take place&mdash;in fact, one took place just as we left the South Pacific&mdash;the French could not be doing those tests if it did not have a colony there. I am not going to say, as we have been accused of saying, that we were there to stir up a feeling for French independence, because that had not entered my head before I got there. It is obvious that those tests would not be being carried out there if it were not for the French having that colonial presence. But it will be for those people themselves to decide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one other speaker here today has said, `It is not Australians who have brought this issue of colonialism to world attention but rather President Chirac himself.' The people do not want that testing there in the main, but they have been led to believe that they will not get financial support if the South Pacific is not tied to that nuclear industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the future? We have a responsibility to maintain our protests. A group of parliamentarians from around the world got together the day after our protest march in Papeete and decided that through international networks there would be a group of parliamentarians formed against nuclear weapons. Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Weapon Free World has met in the federal parliament only this week. Senator Bruce Childs has been elected president. My colleague sitting next to me, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), is the vice-president and I am the secretary of that group. We must maintain our protests. I am hopeful of meeting with the French ambassador in Canberra tomorrow to convey the issues that are important in my electorate and are important to other members of this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the statement presented by the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). I compliment the mission on the work they did in Europe and in bringing to the attention of Europe and, to some extent, North America the issue of French nuclear testing. As my colleague for Adelaide (Ms Worth) has said, at the time the mission was in Europe visiting ministers of various governments and trying to get them on side to help us lobby against the resumption of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, we were in Papeete participating in a peaceful demonstration against resumption of nuclear testing. The French Polynesians in Tahiti were almost uniformly opposed to testing. I cannot say, however, that they were uniformly opposed to the French money or the French President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of independence has been raised here today. Before I went there I knew there was an issue and that there were some in French Polynesia that were for decolonisation. They wanted, and still want today, to end the colonial era of the French in that part of our part of the world. But there are still many who derive their incomes from the fact that the French do reside there. Many derive their incomes from the fact that they are testing on the atoll at Mururoa. It is a very complex issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After we had finished our protest march and had held our meetings we formed the group called Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Weapon Free World. Then we got on the plane. At 7.30 in the morning, Sydney time&mdash;one hour before we landed in Sydney&mdash;the French exploded the first nuclear device that they had exploded in a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we condemn the French for resuming testing nuclear weapons in our part of the world, we also have to be careful that we condemn China. It is a different issue for us because we see the islands of the Pacific as part of our part of the world and we see that we are responsible for those small island nations to some degree. We increasingly pay attention to them and to their needs. In a foreign aid and a bilateral sense, we try to work with them to help improve their lot in life and help them maintain their environments, which are under a great deal of threat from many sources. The one threat they do not need is nuclear weapons going off under a coral atoll. I can tell you that in an earlier visit to the Marshall Islands I discovered that the people there feel there is a very severe increased incidence of cancer among the people of the Marshall Islands because of the French nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We condemn not only France for resuming this action but also China for its nuclear program. I suppose we say that at least the Chinese are doing it in their own country, on their own land. It is my view that it no longer makes any sense to continue to test these devices of which we should see the world well and truly rid. </PARA>

Not only did the introduction of that bill bring forth from the government&mdash;belatedly after 12 1/2 years&mdash;a piece of legislation to entrench into law the existing curfew arrangements at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and to add a few changes at the shoulder to sort of dress it up and tizzy it up and pretend to the Australian public that it was in some way different from the measures that had been put forward by the opposition; above and beyond that it has provided the parliament with an opportunity to debate issues related to the reopening of the east-west runway.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh, you are disputing him? He was only an adviser to Graham Richardson when he was a minister in your government. I think it would be very valuable for the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport to listen to what Mr Williams had to say. In an interview on ABC Radio, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So there are two considerations. The first is the time difference. In order to get the departure off, if you do it on the east/west runway it takes an additional 20 seconds, if you do it on the north/south runway it takes an additional 50 seconds, if the departing aircraft is on the north/south runway it is sitting on the runway in a collision situation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: `it is sitting on the runway in a collision situation'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for a longer period of time. It is more likely to and has led, frequently, on a weekly basis to the infringement of separation standards. So I would argue that it's not quicker and it's not safer.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is arguing that it is not quicker and it is not safer to maintain the policy of the operation of the airport which is now maintained by the government. He is an admitted environmental and aviation expert, a person who was an adviser to a former minister in the government. So not only do you have people of that ilk but you also have the Regional Airlines Association, the air traffic controllers union, the Australian International Pilots Association and the current minister's predecessor, Senator Collins, who said in the Senate on 13 August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is absolutely no reason whatever why simultaneous operations, if conducted efficiently and professionally, cannot be used&mdash;as they are used in Adelaide as well as Sydney&mdash;with perfect safety.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are operating in a safer sense because of the standard operating procedures that are put in to cover those types of operations.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parallel runway operations in the purest sense is the safest form of operation than operations on any intersecting runway.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what the two airlines have said in their statement when they published their views endorsing the official views. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept the advice of the regulatory authorities of our own technical experts that safety and efficiency would be diminished by permanently reopening the east-west runway to jet movements. The key point is that intersecting runways are inherently less efficient and less safe.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the two airlines. That is the view of the regulatory authority. It is the view of the people who operate the system. But the Leader of the National Party has the gall to put his view in here, trying to juxtapose an argument to say that because there is one directional runway in Melbourne and other ports with a cross-wind heading they have cross-wind runways. If the winds change, what do you want to do? Close the airport down for a day or two? The cross-wind runway will be used in Sydney when the weather changes, as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the government deregulated the airline system there has been a 60 per cent upward movement in traffic. If we were to adopt the opposition's policy all the people who come from the provincial cities of New South Wales would need to hub at a certain airport and get into a wider-bodied aircraft. So the people in 10-, 15- or 20-seater planes from Albury, Cowra, Dubbo, Mudgee, Tamworth, Armidale, Griffith, Hay or Wagga will all have to hub somewhere and then climb into a wide-bodied aircraft so it can get access to the Mascot airport. That is why this parallel system is inherently more safe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government has the other policy in place, and that is to diminish the burden of the noise through two things. One is the most ambitious noise abatement program in the world and the second is the establishment and development of Badgerys Creek airport so that the city has a complementary airport, so that burden is taken from people. But the Leader of the Opposition wants to put the noise back on, as the minister estimates, 86,000 people or, as the mayor of Rockdale estimates, 142,000 extra people as aircraft again use the east-west configuration on a permanent basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this is about relieving the Leader of the Opposition from some pressure in the seat of Bennelong. He can go on as much as he likes. He is damned by his own quotes. He is damned out of his own mouth on safety, on micro-economic reform, on doing what should be done when you know what is right to be done. He is damned backwards and forwards. That is why I say he thinks the public in some way are going to fall for the malarky that he is out there trying to even up the noise. They all know the issues here. They have been in this debate for years. It has been on for 20 years. They all know that, if the east-west runway opens, about 100,000 people are going to get more noise. They know that if a cross-wind heading is used again the place is going to be inherently unsafe. They know that capacity is going to go down. The tourism industry knows it will not cope with the numbers. They know it is all about his seat.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I take this opportunity to indicate to the House the very serious national implications of any delay in the construction of the new airport at Badgerys Creek; that is, the Sydney West airport that this government is committed to commissioning in time for the year 2000 Olympics. There is no doubt that delay is an absolute certainty unless the Leader of the Opposition backs away from his reckless attempt to vandalise the government's airport leasing strategy. Have no doubt about that; a very considerable delay is involved. I will indicate to the House exactly why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole financing of Sydney West airport is predicated on the leasing of Sydney's existing airport. Indeed, the two airports are leased together. Ensuring that Sydney West is built and opened by the end of 1999 to a standard and to the timetable set by the government is an absolutely non-negotiable condition of the lease of Sydney airport. We are very busy. I indicate to the House that the environmental impact statement on the first of the major road links to that airport will be released early next week. We are working with the Federal Airports Corporation and the Department of Transport to have that job under way, because it faces an extraordinarily tight time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leasing of Sydney airport and the funding of Sydney West are an essential, intrinsic part of an overall package. By broadening that leasing process, the opposition leader is making that timetable impossible. In turn, he is ensuring that Sydney only has one airport in the year 2000 to cater for the great influx of traffic that will bring those hundreds of thousands of tourists to Australia in the year 2000 to attend that great event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, he will block and delay the work of thousands of construction workers in western Sydney whose job it will be to ready that airport and to have it there to serve the interests of Sydney. Along the way, he will ensure enormous congestion and chaos at Sydney airport. Not only is he sentencing us to one airport; he is saying that, if he is ever unfortunate enough to be elected, it will be one airport with cross-runways operating jet movements. That is what he has committed himself to. The capacity of the airport then falls over.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only would we have no jobs, no airport and enormous congestion and chaos at Kingsford Smith airport; we would also have a flow-on delay at every airport around Australia. One of the truisms of Graeme McMahon in the circular he put out last year to all the frequent fliers at Ansett was that a delay at Sydney airport prangs around the whole system. It has a knock-on or repeater effect. Every time a plane is in a holding pattern or is stuck on the ground at Kingsford Smith, it is late getting to the other end. That compounds itself around the whole system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not all that will be lost. A delay in the leasing of Kingsford Smith airport will also mean a delay in the transfer of curfew operations and the curfew shoulder operations that are covered by the bill that passed through this parliament yesterday. So there will not be any of those freighters going out there at the end of 1999 either. They will all be stuck at Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simultaneously, in the national scene, the Leader of the Opposition will hold back the leasing of all the other FAC airports.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he were to do that, in one fell swoop he would increase the cost of developing Sydney West airport because we would not only have to have it ready in 1999 for international and domestic flights on the curfew but also have to cater for 75 international flights a day. That is more than 500 international flights per week&mdash;of those, 420 are jumbo jets. That is the sort of airport you would have to build first up at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the environmental impact statement, the additional cost of that was put down at $1 billion. So it is a further $1 billion hit as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. Yes, I have seen various reports of the need for tax concessions. Almost every week there are further such reports outlining what the opposition is saying in various places around the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen this week in the latest edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Womens' Weekly</EMPHASIS>, which is a very popular magazine bought by almost a million Australian women, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition pledging tax relief for families and tax concessions for retirees. A few days before that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> carried a story saying that the opposition was considering options to slash tax on bank savings and would offer small businesses dramatic relief from fringe benefits and capital gains taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition's office issued a list of so-called policies which included promises to provide an incentive to take out private health insurance, to provide assistance to single income families with children, to provide more money for roads and to provide a guarantee of a fixed percentage of Commonwealth revenue to the states. Just before that we had in the Lismore <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Star</EMPHASIS> the Leader of the Opposition advocating an increase in Austudy and promising to the children at Ballina High School that there would be a substantial increase in Austudy. The day before another promise appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which stated: `The opposition pledges more science funding'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost every week we are seeing these sorts of promises coming from the coalition. They are everywhere you look. They are promising tax cuts here, tax cuts there, tax cuts everywhere. Perhaps this is what the opposition means when they talk about having released a lot of policies. Of course all of these promises would cost a lot of money. For example, the promise by the Leader of the Opposition to bridge the gap between the dole and Austudy&mdash;a promise he made to the children of Ballina High School&mdash;would cost $185 million.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some $185 million. That is just that one promise. His promise, which he has repeated a number of times, to give the states a fixed share of Commonwealth taxation revenue would cost $2.8 billion over the next two years. The health insurance incentives which he is advocating, if they are anything like what they were in Fightback, would cost about $850 million. Obviously, they are a very expensive set of promises. All of the promises that I have not been able to cost would obviously cost hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is the same opposition which is opposing the government's measures to reduce the budget deficit. In the budget debate this year we have seen the opposition oppose $1.5 billion worth of tax measures. They are also seeking to reduce various spending cuts, such as the better targeting of child-care assistance and changes to the HECS scheme. As we have heard in the last couple of days, they now want to stop the government going ahead with the privatisation of the airports at a cost of something in the order of $2 billion.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we have got all of this going on, we have got them going around the country making all these promises about tax concessions. At the same time as they are trying to stop all sorts of measures getting through the budget, they are also saying that they support severe corrective measures to address the current account. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on record on various occasions saying that we should have severe corrective measures, tighter fiscal policy, to address the current account deficit; yet at the same time he is promising all these tax cuts and trying to stop the government from introducing tighter fiscal policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a total stack of contradictions! What a complete set of non sequiturs in terms of a logical development of policy! How can you possibly go round saying that you support measures to address the current account through tighter fiscal policy, when you are trying to stop us doing it and you are also advocating all over the place measures to loosen fiscal policy. The only way that that hangs together in any shape or form is if you also have a stack of policies to draconically smash through government expenditure programs. There is no other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since you say you have ruled out any tax increases, the only way all that hangs together is to have a secret plan to smash government expenditures, particularly in the areas which you have not ruled out cuts in such as health, education, community services, housing, welfare, employment programs&mdash;these sorts of things which are essential to the living standards of the Australian people. These are the areas in which your policies would have to involve dramatic cuts if there were to be any kind of logic about your policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the policy position that the opposition is adopting means that they are not at all concerned about budget outcomes, they are quite happy to see large budget deficits, which makes a nonsense of the business about addressing the current account. This was repeated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women's Weekly</EMPHASIS> where, in the same paragraph that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said he promised these tax concessions, he said he would cut back on the current account deficit in the first term of government and eliminate it in the second but at the same time he has this array of measures to cut taxes and is trying to stop us tighten fiscal policy. The only way that that could possibly hang together is to have a secret plan to slash government expenditure in a host of areas which are so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is what they did last time. It is exactly what they did last time. When the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, what he did was to slash welfare expenditure. He cut the real level of pensions and unemployment benefits.</PARA>

There was this dramatic attack on social expenditures by the opposition when they were last in government. It did not give them a budget surplus; they still had budget deficits.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question. The first point to make about Australia TV is that half the members of this chamber and half the members of the Senate have been congratulating the ABC on the great job it has been doing in putting together Australia TV. I am always surprised at how frequently Senator Alston, the opposition spokesman on communications, attends the launches promoting Australia TV both in Australia and overseas. I have heard one or two opposition spokesmen as well advocating that Australia TV has done a good job in raising our profile in Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to deny to the member for North Sydney that the ABC has certainly not met its targets in obtaining sponsorship for Australia Television. That is why the government at the moment has a review of the international broadcasting services of the ABC, both Radio Australia and Australia TV. But I would have thought the honourable member for North Sydney would agree with the view, which is widely held I think on both sides of this House, that it has been good for Australia to have Australia TV out there raising Australia's profile. The question, as we conduct the review, is whether this is the best way for the public's finances to be used to promote Australia in the region, or are there alternative options that can be explored. Decisions will be made on Australia TV probably by the end of next month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston, the opposition spokesman on pay TV, has criticised the government for the fact that the ABC has been involved in pay TV. Yet Senator Alston was the senator who moved the amendment in the Senate that forced the ABC to be involved in pay TV. It is a bit hypocritical of the Liberals to run around saying that it is a terrible thing that the ABC has not been successful in pay TV and the government is responsible when it was a deal between the Liberals and the Australian Democrats that actually forced the ABC to be issued a licence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's point of view, we said that we did not want the ABC's involvement in pay TV to have any detrimental effect on the ABC's free to air services. So we gave the ABC $12 1/2 million to try to ensure there was no impact on the excellent content that goes to make up the ABC's free to air services. I know that some people, including Senator Alston, are suggesting that all $12 1/2 million has been spent. My advice is that that is not correct: it is significantly less than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But really it is up to the ABC board and the board of Australian Information Media to make public announcements about this issue. People should remember that the parliament required the government to issue the licence. We have done that. It is not the government's job to negotiate the ABC-Fairfax-Cox corporate arrangement with the cable operators. That is the responsibility of the board of AIM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is this: you asked whether I have confidence in the board of the ABC. Yes, I do. I think that the ABC produces some excellent quality television and radio and I hope that continues for many years to come.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal opposition wants to run an industrial relations policy which drives individual members of the work force on individual wage contracts, but where in the negotiation of those contracts there is no test as to disadvantage. There is no test as to whether a working person will be compensated when other elements of what is now an award package are negotiated away under an enterprise agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made clear in the House before that such things as overtime, penalty rates and holiday leave loadings may be traded in and cashed out to an employee provided this can only happen on the basis that the employee is made no worse off. In other words, if the employee wants to take some of these benefits as cash, the government's no disadvantage test provides flexibility in the labour market. But we do believe that there are community obligations on areas such as sick leave and other things that should not be cashed out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the case with the opposition. The opposition will allow these things to be basically taken away without compensation. I gave some examples the other day. Let me flesh some of them out. I talked about a nurse who was receiving penalty rates and overtime. She now finds they have gone and this would reduce the nurse's income by about 22 per cent or $5,000 a year. A truck driver who works 12 hours overtime a week is offered a new contract by his employer with just the minimum conditions. In that case, even if he works 12 hours more than a usual full-time driver, he finds his annual income is cut by $113 a week or $5,900 a year&mdash;a cut of about 18 per cent. That would apply to the 359,000 people in that occupation at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw an example recently where a Mr Geoff Allan in Western Australia was dismissed when he refused to take a workplace agreement which did not include overtime pay and did not offer any compensation for losing annual leave, sick leave and public holidays. Unluckily for Mr Allan he worked in Western Australia. The Western Australian government has introduced its version of what the Leader of the Opposition believes is a good industrial relations policy. Mr Allan was eventually sacked for not agreeing to the conditions. No doubt some other person who has agreed to the conditions has taken his place. This is the chipping away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would say, `Well, why would the coalition want to do these things?' Is it that it will increase the profit share? Yet the profit share is already at a record high. Is it such that it is going to improve our competitiveness? But we are already 40 per cent more competitive than we were a decade ago. Is it for productivity? You would say, `Well, it must be for productivity.'

What would happen under a Howard government is that the Reserve Bank would go for the interest rate lever immediately because there is no accord and interest rates would rise to cover the increase in wage inflation that would come from it. It is worth recalling that the Leader of the Opposition has had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal coalition's labour policy would bring the greatest change to Australia greater than its proposed goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view he put in 1993. He has always seen the big change as not the GST&mdash;even though he is still hungering for that. He regards the greater change as a change in the labour market policies, as introducing their labour market policies. That is what he sees as the great change. So does the ACTU and so does the work force. That is why a coalition government would be met immediately with a very large wage round which would kick wage inflation along, and straightaway the Reserve Bank would go for the interest rate lever. That is why in a coalition government you will see a dramatic increase in interest rates as the only remedy to try to handle wage inflation.</PARA>

Can the minister inform the House of the government's response to these issues?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bass for her question. It is a timely question in the sense that it anticipates by just a few days the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. That agreement has been in place as a framework for a great deal of housing policy throughout the postwar period. It has resulted in the construction of nearly 400,000 houses and the housing of about 500,000 additional people during our time in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of attitudes to housing in Australia, in part some of that research refers to the very high level of satisfaction generally with housing; according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 86 per cent of Australians are satisfied with their housing. In addition, the ABS has recently indicated, according to a comprehensive survey, that home ownership in Australia is at historically very high levels at over 70 per cent. Further, this government has made a major contribution through the first home owners scheme which resulted in housing about 370,000 people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some reference by the Leader of the Opposition to a report by NCSEM which went to the issue of affordability for housing for low income people. This government's record is that in part we have sought to care for low income people by quite dramatically increasing public housing stock&mdash;by about 50 per cent since we have been in office. But we also recognise what was certainly not recognised by the opposition in its time&mdash;the fact that a great number of people in the private rental market require housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1983 the level of housing assistance for low income people was around $5 a week&mdash;a miserly amount and an amount quite insignificant in terms of what people were paying by way of rent. In our time in office we have increased the maximum rate of rent assistance for single people by around 90 per cent, for families with one or two children by 105 per cent and families with three or more children by 135 per cent. So not only have we dramatically increased the extent of public housing; we have effectively put alongside public housing a very substantial scheme for assistance in the rental market. I emphasise that because it is an important part of comprehensive housing reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth-state housing agreement was created in the 1940s as part of a vision for postwar reconstruction. It recognised the needs of an immigration that would be one of the great immigrations of the postwar period. It recognised the needs of growing industry and the provision of public housing to go with that industry. It recognised that we needed to develop policies within the context of comprehensive social policy. That is why when the Leader of the Opposition speaks about poverty and inequality we remember that rent assistance under his government was five bucks a week. We remember that under the previous government public housing was not dramatically expanded; it was cut. We remember that under the Liberal and National parties there has been no articulation of policy and no recognition that there needs to be any kind of public debate&mdash;no recognition of the need to involve the public in discussing these kinds of fundamental issues. That is why people are inclined to be sceptical about the opposition, in part because its record&mdash;I say this to the member for Kooyong who appears to be trying to interject&mdash;is not only abysmal but extremely regressive and in its time in government resulted in a decline in real terms in almost every payment in the social security system. That is why we are sceptical. But your failure to articulate any kind of social policy, to engage in any kind of debate, means we can be quite clear that, apart from scoring the odd debating points, your leader and your party&mdash;the opposition party&mdash;have no commitment to social reform.</PARA>

As a consequence, we now have a work force of over 8 million people&mdash;we had 6 million people in 1983&mdash;household disposable income has risen by 40 per cent, and household disposable income per capita has risen by 21 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the provision or subsidisation by government of non-cash benefits, such as health, education, housing and community services, has an important impact upon material wellbeing. Excluding them from poverty measures may give a misleading picture of trends over time if the magnitude or type of such non-cash benefit is changing. NATSEM estimate that the addition of the social wage substantially reduces estimates of poverty by nearly 50 per cent overall.

It is this document produced by the Union Bank of Switzerland. It is a study called the `Prices and Earnings Around the Globe: 1994 Edition'. I have had a chance to have a bit of a flick through it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to this publication, a Sydney bus driver earned the equivalent of $US16,000 in 1994. That compares, according to this, with the Seoul bus driver who, it asserts, earned $US16,800. Unfortunately, the basis for the opposition's claim is hopelessly inaccurate. The Department of Industrial Relations advised me that the Australian full-time adult bus driver earns a good deal more than $US16,000. In fact, it has given me the ABS report for the year of 1994, which indicates that the Australian full-time adult bus driver actually earned an average income of $US24,583.

As if all this&mdash;the annual leave, the hours of work, the 46 per cent&mdash;were not enough, the report goes on to highlight the disparity in living standards between Sydney and Seoul. This is your own report. It indicates that the purchasing power of wages in Sydney is twice as high as it is in Seoul. The Sydney bus driver gets 46 per cent more and his wages buy twice as much.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I commend you on selecting this matter of public importance. I am also proud of the fact that my wife is a No. 1 citizen and is at home this day proudly looking after our son, Harrison. Shame on the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a sense of deja vu about this. As I delightfully raise and support this matter of public importance, I cast my mind back. I happen to remember November 1975 in another parliament sitting opposite the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who was known at the time as the member for Heffron. He was in opposition and I was in government. It was 11 November 1975, which is perhaps why I remember it so well. I happened to move a motion in the New South Wales state parliament in support of the operations of Mascot airport, twin parallel runways on a north-south axis&mdash;the building of a third runway, in effect&mdash;and expanding the use of wide-bodied jets to reduce the number of jet movements in the area of Mascot. Remembering that there were not many wide-bodied jets in full operation at that time. The Airbus, 767s and others have come on stream since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then looked at the speech given by the Minister for Transport 20 years ago. I find that I am in agreement with some aspects of his speech. Those aspects made up not a bad speech 20 years ago. In the course of that examination of the state <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I found that he was in support of part 2(a) of my resolution with regard to wide-bodied aircraft. But, with regard to the third runway, he got that wrong then, and he has got it wrong now. He spoke up in opposition to the third runway at that time. It is a little embarrassing, as he is the minister who then presided over the completion of the construction of the third runway. He championed its cause when he eventually brought on the official opening at about the worst possible time last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive to go back through the detail of the speech of the then member for Heffron, the now federal Minister for Transport, which he made 20 years ago in the New South Wales state parliament. Some of us have long memories. Some of us will hold you accountable for the complete mess the government has made with regard to the operation of Australia's largest gateway airport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very clear. It is on the record. Will you allow me to table it? Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the New South Wales state <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> with regard to these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move onto the second matter. It really does go to the nub of the matter. It relates to this question of Simops. One particular type of crossover runway operation can be termed Simops. Another kind of crossover runway operation is better known as independent interspersed operation. They are two separate things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Brereton" NAMEID="5T4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr Brereton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which one are you for?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer that in a moment, Minister. Wait your turn. I made contact as a private citizen, and as an identified federal member of parliament, with an officer of Airservices Australia. What he told me about the Tullamarine operation this month, this week, was pretty interesting. He confirmed that, yes, there were two crossover runways&mdash;0927, the east-west runway, and 1634, the north-south runway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He confirmed, as well he might&mdash;and it is a matter of public record; it is not confidential&mdash;that Tullamarine is used for Simops, known by that name internationally for that type of operation, on a regular basis winds permitting. Separate to that, Tullamarine is also used for independent interspersed operations. The difference is a technical one. When they are using it for Simops, it is when they are using both runways for landings interspersed and one runway for take-offs at the same time. That is Simops. When they are using it for independent interspersed, it is when they are using the north-south runway for landings, for argument's sake, and the east-west runway for take-offs, which is the frequent pattern to maximise usability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I would test this at the coalface. I have a contact, who is not well known to me but is one I respect, who operates as a captain of pure jet aircraft here in Australia. Earlier this month, he chose to land, as part of his program and schedule, at Tullamarine in that particular jet. He landed into the south. He decided upon taxiing in to just check with the tower because he noticed the aircraft were taking off east-west on this particular occasion while he was landing interspersed on the north-south runway. The tower at Tullamarine replied, `This is the preferred runway operation for maximum utilisation&mdash;planes taking off to the west and landing from the north.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the absolute answer to the lies perpetrated by this government with regard to the debate over the future use of Mascot. What the coalition, what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), is responsibly proposing is to provide the intersection to be where it is most controllable and most safe, and where it is the logical place to provide it&mdash;that is, on the ground at Mascot&mdash;as opposed to the government's alternative operation of Mascot which is to provide the crossover of aircraft traffic at low altitude in the suburbs to the north and south of Mascot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This diagram makes it very clear that you are in fact crossing over aircraft in their approaches and departures from Mascot at different altitudes with interspersed operation, I fully accept, but you choose to do it at low altitude over the suburbs of Sydney. We would choose to do it within the boundaries of the aircraft in the maximum controlled safety environment involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to the Minister for Transport that you cannot have it both ways. You cannot argue that it would be wrong to resume the full operation of the east-west runway, even allowing for the displaced third runway further to the east and its operation, and on the other hand argue that it is okay to operate Tullamarine on a Simops basis. Minister, for all I know, as the winds may abate in Melbourne, they could have resumed Simops at Tullamarine at this moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simops, the thing you will not allow to happen at Mascot, is operating at Canberra airport. As members flock to the airport in the next hour, have a good look at the runway you use. Have a good look at the cross runway. Those of us travelling on flights direct from Canberra to Albury tend to get shunted on to the cross runway where we wave goodbye to all our colleagues taking off in jets on the north-south runway at the Canberra airport. The minister really is exposed on this particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go on to talk about the airlines directly. It is interesting to hear that a couple of weeks ago Ansett and Qantas came out and said that they did not support the opening of the east-west runway. Some of their management have intimated otherwise in private discussions with members of the coalition. I am not going to do the wrong thing in regard to those discussions. I respect the confidentiality of the people involved. It actually goes further than that. There are papers around indicating that the major airlines have fought long and hard with regard to the operation of the east-west runway and the problems created by its closure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a document from Hazelton Airlines. That airline is not to be sneezed at because it is a substantial commuter airline operator, a decentralised commuter airline operator and a publicly listed commuter airline operator which has modernised its fleet and withstood drought and everything else that the state and federal governments have thrown at it from time to time in relation to the intrastate licensing scheme which is operated by your colleagues&mdash;they were mine in the past, regrettably&mdash;at Macquarie Street. What does Hazelton say with regard to this particular matter. Their media statement of 25 September 1995 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two largest independent regional airlines operating in New South Wales, Hazelton and Tamair, today called on the Federal Government to reopen the east-west runway and implement long overdue changes to air traffic management procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The airlines believe that a substantial reduction in the levels of noise now affecting thousands of Sydney residents can be achieved by introducing changes to air traffic management procedures which will also increase the number of aircraft movements and further reduce delays at Sydney Airport.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the direct opposite of what the Prime Minister was saying with his hub nonsense here this afternoon. Hazelton Airlines, which you spit on, Minister, has done the hard yards in developing decentralised links. SAAB aircraft&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not talking about stub operations. They have called for the full east-west runway operation. The minister is rather embarrassed by this very clear-cut statement. Clearly he could not have heard the first paragraph. There it is in absolute terms. He made the same presentation very directly to a number of us in Parliament House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I say with regard to this matter of public importance that there is another and related matter with regard to the reopening of the east-west runway. I refer to yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, which happens to record the results of a very interesting division. I find five names here&mdash;they are Keating candidates in particular seats around New South Wales&mdash;who voted against the reopening of the east-west runway and by that action jeopardised commuter airline flights from Lismore, Orange, Albury and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members involved were M. Easson&mdash;she has now long since departed from Mascot and will probably land on a Simops crossover runway in Europe, try Paris or Frankfurt&mdash;N.J. Newell, D.W. Simmons, J.H. Snow and H.F. Woods. Here are Keating's candidates in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> voting to jeopardise their air links and undermine decentralisation in the process. They have been exposed in their electorates. Their electorates will make a judgment on them I hope on 4 November, otherwise 11 November&mdash;the sooner the better. If not, they will make the judgment in February or March 1996. Those electors stand ready to throw out those members who have voted against the interests of their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come back to another aspect which the minister will dwell on. It relates to the asset sales, which the shadow minister for finance&mdash;the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser)&mdash;and the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) remind me have been an area of massive underperformance by this government. How dare you suggest that we will not be able to handle asset sales efficiently. Let us look at your record. For the financial year 1990-91 you put in the budget $1 billion of asset sales. What did you achieve&mdash;$161 million. In 1991-92 you put in the budget a target of $625 million of asset sales. What did you achieve in that year&mdash;$301 million. In 1992-93 you put in the budget $1.6 billion of asset sales and what did you achieve&mdash;$801 million. It is a pretty shabby record with regard to the actual performance of the government in its asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will capably manage asset sales and privatisation in a proper manner with due reference to community service obligation and with due safeguards to the national interest and to the interests of the community at large. It is interesting that the government has bracketed both Sydney West and Sydney as part of their privatisation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in loud and clear terms&mdash;and I look forward to being supported by the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) with regard to this matter&mdash;that the crunch time has come with regard to Mascot. Its operation is regarded as a laughing stock by international airline operators worldwide. They are fed up with the extra delays at that level. At the local level, those travelling from Orange to Sydney are fed up with a 29-minute flight taking 54 minutes and with automatic extra tracking by virtue of the navigation system imposed on the crazy runway operation at Mascot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for the minister to come clean, to swallow hard, to get it right and to reopen the east-west runway on an independent interspersed operational basis, which would not only reduce and spread the noise funnel that has been created by this government with regard to the operation of Mascot but also make more efficient and effective, as well as protect the safety of, the operation of Australia's most important gateway airport. It is time, Minister, for you to depart. It is time for us to take over the Treasury bench and reopen the east-west runway at Mascot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever there were proof that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) should have stuck to farming, it is his contribution this afternoon in the parliament. Certainly, there is no place for him in modern aviation. Can I begin by saying thank you to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) both for the opportunity to speak and for reminding me of my long consistency in respect to the affairs of Kingsford Smith airport. It is a great pity, it is a dreadful shame, that he cannot boast the same consistency, because what he is arguing today and what his whole party have been arguing this last week since this madhouse decision of theirs to reopen the east-west runway for jet operations is absolutely inconsistent with everything they have collectively stood for for more than 20 years now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are they doing it? They are doing it for the basest of political motives. If you look at the map of all of the surrounding seats, it is very clear that there are only two seats that are truly highly marginal, and they are both on the alignment. There are actually three&mdash;there is one of ours, but it is nowhere near as marginal as the other two. Lowe is our seat at 5.1 per cent, which is reasonably marginal, but the two really marginal seats are Bennelong with 3.2 per cent and Cook with 3.5 per cent. They are at either end of that parallel runway configuration. In the case of Cook, the village of Kurnell&mdash;the Kurnell you could not give a hang about when you were campaigning for this runway configuration&mdash;is also being dramatically affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this airport expansion was announced in 1989, it was announced on the basis that there would be a north-south axis for traffic, because that is the only way you could get the throughput that is necessary to meet the demands for Australia's No. 1 international gateway, our principal airport&mdash;the one that overwhelmingly carries traffic, international and domestic, in Australia. Every day 75 international jets come in or go out of Mascot airport. Right from the very first moment it was the north-south axis that the airport was to operate on. Indeed, the environmental impact statement was predicated entirely&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member interjects. Let me just announce to him the submission of his colleague, Nick Greiner, to the EIS in December 1990 when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of people seriously affected would reduce from 54,700 to 26,900. Those moderately affected would reduce from 170,000 to 82,000. However, new areas will become exposed to aircraft noise and some areas will be exposed to higher levels of aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the actual New South Wales government's submission, the Liberal submission, to the EIS:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decreases would be in the east and the west with moderate reductions to the south but increases to the north. The noise outcome is a logical conclusion as those movements arriving from the north on the third runway are much higher over urban areas because of its staggered threshold 3 kilometres south of the existing runway's northern threshold.</PARA>
<PARA>When I talk of inconsistency, what was the Leader of the National Party saying a little later? He could not say that he did not know: he had had chance to study the EIS after it was published, with this attachment from the New South Wales state government. This is what the man proposing this matter of public importance this afternoon said publicly on 13 August 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any further delay in deciding on the third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What was he talking about? I will tell you what he was talking about. He was talking about that series of questions that had been raised about what would have been the world's worst accident. The accident in Tenerife was the world's worst accident to date with two wide-bodied jets. On that occasion, had that Boeing 747 of Qantas which was parked at the intersection been taken out by the Ansett domestic jet and the Thai Airways DC10&mdash;there were only three seconds in it&mdash;it would have been, heaven forbid, the world's worst accident. That was the concern. That is what the Leader of the National Party was speaking about then when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any further delay in deciding on the third runway for Mascot could mean loss of life as well as economic insanity. With Mascot now operating at near maximum capacity, air traffic controllers bending over backwards to extract maximum efficiency out of the present archaic runway set-up, the risk factor must greatly increase.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say the following month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EIS has already found that a third runway would mean an overall reduction of more than 50 per cent in the total number of residents affected by aircraft noise.</PARA>
<PARA>If you didn't know where these 50 per cent fewer people were going to be, it's a mighty strange state of affairs. There you are saying that you have studied the report and you know that there are going to be 50 per cent better off. The report says there are going to be some people worse off and they are going to be on the north-south axis. But you had this absolutely hypocritical act of saying this week that the cross-runway should be reopened, even though every piece of expert advice says the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen some funny things, some weird things, in 25 years in public life but I have never seen anything that exposes people as badly as this exposes the opposition. I have spoken to all the experts. I am pleased that the Leader of the National Party referred to Max Hazelton as one person who was in favour of the east-west runway. Max has been to see me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one reason and one reason only why the government has been so stunned by the `not for sale' sign hung out by the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) over Sydney airport: it is that the Prime Minister and member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) now wears Australia's privatisation crown. It is now the Prime Minister, and no-one else, who wants to sell off the family silver. It is the Prime Minister who is worshipping at the altar of economics. It is the Prime Minister who has swallowed the economic textbook. It is the Prime Minister who would sell his grandmother if he thought he would get a decent price for her. Fear is spreading through the ranks of the ALP because it has been stuck with this unpopular privatisation policy. Fear is creeping across its back bench the way the bald spot is creeping across the Prime Minister's scalp. Just the other day the Prime Minister boasted to caucus about the fantastic scare campaign he was going to run against the opposition. The fact of the matter is that our policy is to open Badgerys Creek airport. Our policy is to send the big jets west. Our policy is to reduce noise all round. Please, please, Prime Minister, run a scare campaign on that. That is not scary at all. The only people who are scared by the coalition's policy&mdash;and I can see them arguing like cats and dogs up the back there now&mdash;are the Prime Minister's own backbench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the Prime Minister told his caucus the other day was that he was going to keep the faith. He said, `Keep the faith, fellas. Hold on.' What is the Prime Minister's faith? It is quite clear that the Prime Minister's faith is nothing but privatisation&mdash;privatisation whatever the cost, privatisation whatever the pain, privatisation whatever the electoral discomfort it causes to his own people. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister now wears the privatisation crown like his paramount chief headgear. There he is&mdash;the Prime Minister, Chief of Privatisation. The Prime Minister wears his title, Sir Paul of Privatisation, like he wears his Thai knighthood. The Prime Minister will be made to wear his degree&mdash;Dr Paul Keating, PhD in Privatisation&mdash;like he wears his Japanese doctorate. He will wear this crown. He will not be allowed to get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this move of the coalition has completely confused members opposite; they just do not know what to say. On the one hand, we are big spenders; the next minute, we are terrible cutters. They cannot decide whether we are wimps or ogres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister wants a contest in hairy-chested economic rationalism, good luck to him because we are not going to compete. He is the one who now wears the privatisation crown and he will wear that like a crown of thorns until the next election when his government will be crucified on the cross-runways of Sydney airport and all the lies that they have told about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does privatisation mean? According to two experts in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, privatisation means that Badgerys Creek will never be built. It means that Sydney west can remain `an intention' forever. This government's privatisation bill contains no requirement that the private operator must construct Badgerys Creek, places no obligation on the private operator to shift in the near future or at all from Kingsford Smith to Badgerys Creek, establishes no statutory limits on the operation of Kingsford Smith, and creates a competitive environment which acts as an incentive to maximise aircraft and passenger movement through Kingsford Smith. That is the truth. This government's policy means that all the people of inner western Sydney will be prisoners forever of Kingsford Smith airport. They have a life sentence to aircraft noise under the privatisation policy of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this whole third runway is that it is not a third runway at all; it is a replacement second runway. The so-called third runway was supposed to mean more flights and less noise. In fact, it has meant less flights and more noise. The so-called third runway was supposed to mean aircraft landing and taking off over Botany Bay. It has not meant that at all. It has meant aircraft landing and taking off over the homes of more and more Sydneysiders. The so-called third runway has been a $200 million failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government the incredible has been achieved&mdash;two plus one equals two. That is a feat of mental gymnastics worthy of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). You have to ask yourself: who is to blame for this? According to Graham Richardson and Laurie Oakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating is the one people should be mad at. He not only got the third runway decision through cabinet but was responsible for changes to the original plan which are now causing massive problems.</PARA>

<PARA>`Get that', say Laurie Oakes and Graham Richardson. The people of Sydney will `get that'. They will know that the author of their discomfort is none other than the Prime Minister himself. Continuing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original proposal was supposed to be that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than houses. Clever Keating changed that and sent them roaring over suburbia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why the member for Barton (Mr Punch) so strongly backed the Prime Minister's campaign to stab the former Prime Minister in the back. And that is why the people of Sydney will blame the current Prime Minister for all the misery and all the agony that this so-called third runway has inflicted on them and which the government's privatisation policy is just going to make worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is the chief villain in all this, but he is not the only villain.

The Minister for Transport, in conjunction with the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Blaxland, have dudded the member for Lowe. They have dudded Mary Easson in the same way as they dudded Michael Easson when he wanted a seat in parliament. Of course, we all know about the member for Watson.

<PARA>That is the direct opposite of what the Leader of the National Party is now arguing, together with the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). They are not my words. They are the words of the Leader of the National Party when he was a member of the New South Wales parliament. So let us nail the hypocrisy of the opposition. The reason that they are interested in this proposal now has nothing to do with policy. It is not policy driven. It is driven by the polls. It is driven by those seats on the north-south axis&mdash;the seat of the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, where the margin is only 3.2 per cent and the seat of Cook where it is only 3.5 per cent. And we have just had the election to Hunters Hill of a mayor from the No Aircraft Noise Party. Also, it is directed, in effect, at shoring up the opposition's position. </PARA>

<PARA>That is why they are concerned about what is happening at Sydney airport.

They were leading the cheer squad, as was the then New South Wales Liberal-National Party, for the construction of the third runway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will not be opposing the amendments that we are now examining, but we believe they are not the most satisfactory approach that could have been taken on this matter. We argued in the other place&mdash;and my colleague Senator Amanda Vanstone, the shadow Attorney-General, moved an amendment&mdash;to ensure that the government's proposals, which would have dramatically increased the reporting requirements on large exempt proprietary companies, were amended so as to ensure that these companies would continue under the existing reporting requirements if they wished to do so. The amendment would allow them to continue to choose between having an auditor or lodging simple key financial data.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's proposal, as we understood it before the amendments, was to force these companies not only to have an auditor but also to lodge financial returns. Under the Corporations Law, exempt proprietary companies were able to choose between appointing an auditor or lodging key financial data. The government in failing to support the amendment showed itself to be no friend to the business community&mdash;and that, after all, is where many jobs come from. Many businesses raised concerns about the bill with the coalition. The cost of undertaking a full audit, which the bill now requires, was a particular concern. That is the reason we picked up that argument and advanced it in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that the government has rejected our amendment and maintained the existing proposal&mdash;that is, for reporting requirements for large exempt proprietary companies&mdash;there were in the way in which this matter was dealt with some good news for businesses affected. The coalition was successful in getting the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities to review the bill for a second time. Because we pushed for that review the government agreed to clarify the conditions under which the Australian Securities Corporation can grant an exemption from audit. This could be of benefit and ought to be of benefit to a significant number of companies that had concerns about these new requirements. So there is this exemption proposal. We do not regard it as the best option but it is obviously an improvement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) is at the table. For the next five minutes, I am going to talk a little about the ministerial modus operandi of his senior minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). I am afraid that some of what I have to say will not be terribly complimentary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody doubts the foreign minister's deep intellect and high profile when it comes to some of these international matters, such as nuclear non-proliferation, comprehensive test ban treaties and his latest trip to the 50th UN General Assembly. I say to both the ministers at the table, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), that when it comes to consular matters, particularly in looking after some Australians&mdash;some might say that they are very mundane matters&mdash;the foreign minister is very weak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to go any further than a comment that was made by our shadow minister, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), yesterday in relation to an ongoing sore, which is the case of Dr John Flynn. The honourable member for Mayo said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What Senator Evans fails to realise however is that principal amongst the functions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is the protection of Australian citizens abroad. It is a matter of profound disappointment that Senator Evans has failed to give his full attention to the care and treatment of Australian citizens abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are simply too many instances in which friends and families of Australian citizens caught in terrible situations abroad have been driven to complain directly against Senator Evans for his neglect of their cases. The Wilson, Maresh, Martino, and Flynn cases are all examples of ministerial neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although John Flynn's case is another case of ministerial neglect it is not too late to act in order to give John Flynn the treatment to which he is entitled as an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the contributions that have been made by the shadow minister and Senator Michael Baume in the other place in this case, which continues to cause difficulties both here and in New Delhi. A few weeks ago I received a letter from Tim Eakin, John Flynn's solicitor, who said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Flynn has been under administrative detention in the notorious Tihar Gaol, New Delhi, for nearly 15 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During Dr Flynn's detention, our Department of Foreign Affairs and High Commission in New Delhi have failed to ensure that he is treated justly and in accordance with law and applicable international conventions. His health is in a precarious condition. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This situation came about after Dr Flynn was apprehended in June last year&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>1994&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on suspicion of attempting to smuggle coins out of India. His subsequent detention has been protracted because of administrative and legal malice in India aided by bureaucratic lethargy in Australia. His case reflects great discredit on the Governments of both countries.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have time to go into the detail of why Dr Flynn is being mistreated at the moment other than to say that very strong inducements and duress were involved. His health is suffering. He has suffered detention without trial. The bottom line is that the Australian government has been distinguished only by its lack of application to Dr Flynn's wellbeing. The day before yesterday, his lawyer once again put out a very strong media release to that extent. I would like to be attributed with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Minister Bilney has departed, I say to Minister Walker, who is at the table, that there are several questions I would like to place on the record to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Firstly, does he still have faith in the Indian legal system that has treated Dr Flynn fairly? Secondly, does he believe that justice delayed is justice denied? There is a perception that the Australian government has not pressed Dr Flynn's case because they think he is guilty. Does the Australian government think that Dr Flynn is guilty?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has said that it cannot interfere in judicial proceedings of another country unless an Australian is discriminated against on the basis of nationality. That has been done. I just say to the minister that, in opposition, we will continue to hound the foreign minister. In government, we will put in train a number of ministerial, diplomatic and consular initiatives that will enhance the situation of Australians travelling overseas. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As is well known in this House, the Australian Labor Party is a strong supporter of local government. Indeed, it was the Australian Labor Party, through the Brisbane constitutional convention of 1985, which eventually got the question of constitutional recognition of local government to a referendum. It was the conservatives of this country who totally opposed that constitutional recognition of local government. In Victoria's local government we see that they not only hate Australian workers but also hate democracy and local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have long been a supporter of rational amalgamation and restructure of local government in Victoria. There were in fact 210 councillors in Victoria when I served in local government. But my support for amalgamation and restructure is not support for what the Jeffrey Gibb Kennett government has achieved in Victoria through his political apparatchiks. When I say `political apparatchiks', that is exactly what they were because the local government board was headed by a Liberal Party member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of the community being asked what sorts of changes they wanted, it was totally imposed upon local communities. For example, the old Mansfield shire was amalgamated with the city of Benalla. To give you an idea, the entire town of Mansfield closed down in protest for being lumped in with another body without any consultation. The way this amalgamation was done really has been a major political embarrassment for the government in Victoria. The boundaries are a joke and, of course, politically inspired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say they have in fact improved local government in Victoria. Yet they have created municipalities such as the shire of Strathbogie, which will now be known in Victoria as the New Pyalong. Pyalong was one of the very small municipalities for some 650 ratepayers. Pyalong has gone but they have created Strathbogie in its place&mdash;a municipality which does not conform to all of the research which indicated what should be done to local government in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The politicisation of the local government system in Victoria has been compounded by the fact that, instead of calling for elections and letting democracy take its place in the restructured areas, political appointees were put in as commissioners. That is no secret. Some 27 per cent of the people appointed, called commissioners&mdash;it is almost Stalinist&mdash;are members of the Liberal Party. The chief commissioner is paid some $90,000 and the two other commissioners&mdash;they are not chiefs&mdash;are paid some $60,000 a year. They have given themselves mobile phones, new cars and fax machines, along with all of the perks of office on top. The commissioners are in fact costing a hell of a lot more than the volunteer councillors who used to run local government in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioners are not responsible to the people whom they purportedly represent because they are not elected. In fact, none of them live in the municipalities over which they now have dictatorial control. These commissioners in Victoria are dictated to by the Minister for Local Government and the local government board. For example, Kennett said that they would cut rates by 20 per cent uniformly across the state on these new councils irrespective of whether that is good or bad for the district or whether they could afford it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the commissioners are dragged in on a regular basis and told what to do by the local government board&mdash;Leonie Bourke, the political apparatchik of Jeffrey down there. We see some nonsense taking place. For example, in order to achieve some of these so-called cheaper rates, we are now seeing some very bodgie accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us here have a rough idea of what revenue is and what income is. Would anyone here agree, for example, that $3 million worth of asset sales and a $1 million transfer from reserves is income? It is a one-off and it is not income, yet we are now seeing local government accounts in Victoria showing one-off asset sales as income. They are showing transfers from reserve as income. That is the reserve that former democratically elected councillors put aside for capital works. They are bringing these reserves back in on their current income account and saying, `We have a surplus.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A shire like Yarra Ranges, for example, shows a surplus of roughly half a million dollars. It is actually running a $4 million deficit. Right across Victoria these shonky accounts are now coming out as the Kennett government's shame in local government is being exposed. There is no democracy, but shonky accounting and commissioners running councils in a Stalinist style not for the benefit of the people but for the benefit of the Liberal Party of Victoria. It is a shame. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on behalf of a constituent of mine, Cherry-Dell Phillips. Cherry-Dell is a very special lady who works extremely hard for the community and for charity groups in Stirling and around Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cherry-Dell contacted me the other day about a deceptive method alternative telephone carriers are using to sign up new customers. The carriers are doing this by offering charities and other organisations benefits by getting them to enlist their subscribers or members. They do this by bulk buying or hiring lines off Telstra at reduced rates, and then renting these lines to customers, via a charity or organisation, with the offer of cheaper rates for the customers, plus benefits to the charity or organisation through whom they apply for the connection. Cherry-Dell wrote to me about this. Her letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I signed with the Cancer Foundation thinking by the conditions written on them that I was getting a reduction in the cost of my calls and that the annual rebate could help the Cancer Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On getting my Telecom bill, I discovered that my service was taken over by another carrier. Now this also means I lost my sole parent concession. Fly buys have been cancelled, and any other existing flex plans I had as a customer with Telecom have also been cancelled.</PARA>
<PARA>In getting a discount, Cherry-Dell was meant to receive a six per cent reduction, but only received three per cent&mdash;another deception. She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I object to is the dishonesty in this deal&mdash;the use of charities and organisations names to draw subscribers away from their existing service. These people can steal customers away from Telecom and yet Telecom are not permitted to let their subscribers know what is lost by their signing with these other carriers. It is okay if that is explained what we are signing, but it is not clear. Age pensioners are vulnerable because if they sign, thinking they are just getting a discount, they then discover they have lost the Telecom pension concession, and may not know why.</PARA>
<PARA>What happens essentially is that members of charities or organisations receive an offer asking, for example, `Do you want a discount on your telephone bills and to help this charity at the same time?' Of course it sounds like a great deal, so people tick the box saying yes. What they do not realise, as Cherry-Dell pointed out, is that they will be disconnected from their existing carrier and connected with a new one who has bulk bought or hired the lines off Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some organisations or businesses also rent out the lines to charities and the like, so instead of charities or whichever group renting or buying the lines in bulk off Telstra direct they get them second hand from another organisation who is buying or renting the lines off Telstra. So some organisations are buying or renting the lines, and I imagine they are then writing to charities or sporting clubs or the like and saying, `Have we got a deal for you.' They would offer the organisation the opportunity to offer their members and subscribers discounts on telephone calls plus, for every member they sign up, the organisation would get a donation. They just do not tell them that they will be disconnected from their existing carrier, and that is where I agree with my constituent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they told people the whole story that would be fine,  but people are being disconnected from their existing carrier without their knowledge or consent. As was pointed out to me by Cherry-Dell, if the customers are on a flexi plan, pension benefit or even in Fly Buys they will also lose that benefit, unbeknown to them. </PARA>

This year the grand final will be fought out between the Geelong Football Club&mdash;I represent that city in this parliament&mdash;and the great Carlton Football Club.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to wish the President, players and officials of the Geelong Football Club all the very best in that contest on Saturday. It is going to be one of the great titanic struggles in Australian Rules between two sides that have earned the respect of the sporting world in this particular code. I will tell you, Mr Speaker, at the end of this adjournment speech who is going to win that game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the fourth grand final that Geelong has contested in seven years which, by anybody's measuring stick, is a great achievement. We have recently seen at the club changes in coaching personnel, changes in playing personnel and a restructuring of the club. Yet it has managed to propel itself to the very top of the league table in this premier football code in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very important changes have been made to the coaching staff. I would like to pay tribute here tonight to the efforts of the very young coach of Geelong, Gary Ayres. Gary came to the club from the Hawthorn football club, the famous Hawthorn stable, and has a real wealth of finals experience behind him. He has brought a new dimension to the free-flowing Geelong game, and he has brought some great stability to the players of the club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But my heart tonight, 48 hours away from victory, goes to the President of the Geelong Football Club, Ron Hovey. Ron has been a great stalwart of the Geelong Football Club for the past three decades. I know from speaking to him earlier on in the week and speaking to him last week before the preliminary final that this particular game and this victory will mean a lot to him, as they will to the people of Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute here also to the efforts of Malcolm Blight, the coach who preceded Gary Ayres at the Geelong Football Club. As far as Malcolm was concerned, his coaching style well suited the players at the club. There are many players playing on Saturday in this great event who owe a lot to the efforts of Malcolm Blight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This game means a lot to the city of Geelong, because it gives the city an opportunity to profile itself in both a sporting and other sense to the rest of the nation. As you would know, Mr Speaker, in recent years Geelong has been hit by recession, by industry restructuring and by the financial collapse of the Pyramid Building Society. But the people in the city are a very resilient people. They have come through that period of their history with flying colours. The total weight of the city now sits behind the Geelong Football Club and the players in this contest on Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the players, let me say this: these opportunities to play at this national level and to play in one of the premier sporting events of the world come very rarely in one's sporting life and those opportunities must be grasped with both hands. I will give this advice to the players that was given to me in my `illustrious' football career: play like there is no tomorrow, show them no mercy and take no prisoners. If you want to put a little wager on it, Mr Speaker: Geelong by 27 points. </PARA>

Before I come to that particular matter, I want to comment on the remarks made by the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) when he criticised the actions of the Victorian government with respect to local authority amalgamations. When he criticised the Victorian government, he could well have been criticising the Goss Labor government, which has really forced very many local authorities into a situation of amalgamation without consulting the local communities at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a situation where the residents of the shires of Rosenthal and Allora and the city of Warwick were forced into an amalgamation. When the citizens of one particular shire took the matter to the Supreme Court, the state government just arbitrarily postponed the election and put it off. It is absolutely amazing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is extraordinary and outrageous that there should be these kinds of changes in local authority boundaries without the consent of the local people. But it did not stop on the Darling Downs. The city of Ipswich and the shire of Moreton were amalgamated in a special election just 12 months after the local authority elections which took place throughout Queensland. The state minister arbitrarily sacked all the councillors and called fresh elections for the amalgamated local city. What he did was pass one area of Carole Park away from Moreton shire and put it into Brisbane, leaving that area totally without representation until the next general election of local authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing happened when he took the area of Fernvale and put it into Esk shire. Again that area did not have any representation. Mergers were forced between the city of Gympie and the shire of Widgee, the city of Cairns and the shire of Mulgrave. The city of Mackay and the shire of Pioneer and the city of the Gold Coast and the shire of Albert also merged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amalgamations have taken place without the consent of the local people, without a referendum, without giving those people any choice as to whether they want to maintain the pre-existing situation or whether they want to go into an amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to hear the honourable member for McEwen coming into the chamber and complaining about the Victorian government. He could equally be complaining about the actions of the Goss Labor Government which could well lose office on the basis of a by-election in Mundingburra which may be called following an appeal to the Court of Disputed Returns. So we have an interesting time ahead of us in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The University of Queensland Union for the last little while has been controlled by the Left of the Labor Party. The people who have been running the union have abused the money belonging to the union members.

It is absolutely outrageous that this situation is permitted to continue by the Goss Labor Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 August I moved a motion in the House of Representatives calling for a joint federal-state inquiry into the Hilton Hotel bombing in 1978. This followed, in 1991, the unanimous decision of the New South Wales parliament calling also for a joint federal-state inquiry. Since that time another motion has been passed in the New South Wales parliament, again calling for a joint federal-state inquiry. I notice that a similar motion to mine is now on the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for debate over there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time we got to the bottom of who was responsible for the bombing of the Hilton Hotel. I believe there are no further excuses. We need this joint federal-state inquiry. To not have an inquiry will mean that we will never get to the bottom of who committed these crimes. It is the worst unsolved murder case in Australia's history. It was an embarrassment to Australia. I believe there will be a suggestion of a cover-up if people are not going to support an inquiry into this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, has supposedly opened the files held by the New South Wales government on this matter. When Terry Griffiths, one of the victims of the bombing, went down to look at the files he was told that eight particular files were restricted: he could not look at them. When he phoned the Premier's office to ask why, he was told that the New South Wales government had opened the files but the Commonwealth government had placed restrictions on eight of those files. I would like to know why that is. There may be a very good reason.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opportunity to speak on the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration affords me the opportunity of looking at bank closures throughout Australia in recent years. The committee has considered this issue, and it is one of particular importance to rural communities. I note that page 25 of the report says that the committee has had discussions with the Reserve Bank and also the Australian Bankers Association regarding what they believe has been a major concern&mdash;and I want to reinforce that concern&mdash;that consumers in rural areas are feeling the impact and effect of bank closures right throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been particularly evident in Victoria, where the Commonwealth Bank, when it took over the former State Bank of Victoria, has been one of the signal offenders in this matter. The Commonwealth Bank has closed many hundreds of small branches throughout country and rural areas, and of course this action has caused a great deal of concern amongst those communities. I particularly note that the committee has said that it is interested to monitor the progress of this approach to servicing small business. The committee's concern was whether small businesses and the farming community would be serviced, with the loss of banks from this particular rural and country environment, and the committee is going to monitor the progress of the new approach to servicing small business, particular in regional Australia. I commend the committee for pursuing that issue, because it is important to people throughout rural Australia that they still have access to business and also to private banking facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of branch closures and the introduction of new technology has been an emotional issue, and will continue to be an emotional issue for a lot of people, because one seems to link hand in hand with the other in terms of job losses and closure of branches. The committee found that the arguments put forward by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the banks appear to be quite rational, but it believes that there is a need for a more comprehensive picture of what is happening with regard to branch closures and the strategies for the future in terms of new forms of access to banking services, and it is also going to pursue that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue because we have recently had a branch of the Westpac bank close in Inglewood, a small town in my electorate, and the closure caused a great deal of concern because it left that community without any formal banking facilities. People there do have access to some other banking facilities, but not in terms of loan approvals and applications or in terms of the general commercial activities that a bank might normally be expected to provide. The closure caused a great deal of concern in the community, so I am pleased that the committee is going to continue to pursue that matter. I will be watching the progress of the committee deliberations on that matter because it is a very important issue for rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to refer to the section of the committee's report, on page 27, which looked at the financial institutions duty and the debits tax which used to be known as the BAD tax&mdash;the bank account debits tax. I note that the Australian Bankers Association raised the issue of the FID and the debits tax with the committee, recommending that they should be abolished as they are `distortive, regressive and inefficient'. These taxes, they note, are levied by state governments. In these days of perusal and concern about the banking industry's activities about charges, here is an element that certainly requires much more investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that states are dependent upon these taxes for their revenue raising, but I was interested to read that the ABA, and the committee, found that there was a distortive, regressive and inefficient element of these particular taxes. The committee obviously will be following that issue up. I note that it has requested additional material from the Australian Bankers Association on the impact of these taxes, the compliance costs and the total value of deposits into the banking system which relate to these specific taxes. The committee has noted that it will further examine the concerns raised by the Australian Bankers Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are becoming much more aware of taxes and charges to do with banking. It is certainly under the microscope at the moment and it will obviously generate a lot more interest when the committee examines the concerns. One would hope that it might have public hearings on this where the community could come and give evidence on the impact of these taxes on their businesses and the way their businesses operate, so that the committee can be fully informed of the impact of those two taxes&mdash;the financial institutions duty and the debits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of derivatives is also tackled by the committee. I had the opportunity to go to the Australian Stock Exchange in Sydney last Friday to receive a briefing on not only the activities of the derivatives market but also the activities of the Australian Stock Exchange. I must say that they put on a very impressive briefing session for the members of my committee who were there. I found that they certainly are world leaders in technology and in efficiency in the management and operation of the Australian Stock Exchange, and that they were taking a very innovative and entrepreneurial approach with the regulation of the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also briefed on the Australian derivatives market. Derivatives are an important aspect of financial management, particularly in risk management, and it is important that people understand how they operate and how they can be used as risk management instruments. I note that the committee's conclusion, on page 16, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Derivatives are risk management instruments and are an essential tool in the financial services industry. The responsibility of the Reserve Bank, and other financial supervisors, is to ensure that the risks associated with derivatives are properly managed.</PARA>
<PARA>However, they did not go on to say that people should be educated to understand how the derivatives market works. I think there is a bit of a gap in the knowledge of people in the community on how these derivatives work and the risks that are attached&mdash;and there are risks, but it is a matter of how you can properly manage those risks. You cannot manage those risks without having the knowledge of how that derivatives market works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a task for not only the Australian Stock Exchange but also the brokers to educate the public on how these derivatives work and how they can be used as risk management instruments. There is a task ahead of them there. I think that they are aware of that and that they need to do more in terms of informing people of just how they can be used as a risk management product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I want to address in the report is on page 5 and it refers to lending for housing. Lending for housing is a very important issue in Australia because there are many thousands of people trying to get into the housing market. You might recall that in the lead-up to the 1993 election the Keating government promised the Australian public that it would allow access to superannuation funds for use as housing loans. That promise was never fulfilled. It was quickly forgotten after the 1993 election. There were many thousands of people, and young people in particular, who were paying into superannuation schemes and who were hopeful of having access to their superannuation funds so that they could finance a home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government let them down extremely badly on this issue. Here was an opportunity for people to gain access to some of their superannuation funds and use the funds as a deposit on a home. However, that promise was not fulfilled. That is an important issue. Australians want to have their own home. They see that as one of the best financial investments that they can make during their lifetime. They want to have a home of their own for they see it as a major asset and they are prepared to pay it off during their lifetime. The government made that promise but after the election it made no effort whatsoever to enable people to access some of those superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned young people in particular but it was not confined to young people. It was intended that anyone who was paying into a superannuation fund and who was under 55 could gain access to their superannuation funds, which they could then put towards a home. But that opportunity has been lost. The government made no effort to fulfil that promise that it made to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention now the changes that are going on in the housing finance market and the changes that are going on in the banking industry. In Bendigo we had probably one of the most successful building societies in the state. The Bendigo Building Society was one of the largest home lenders in the state. It concentrated principally on home lending, with 80 per cent of its funding going to that sector. It has been very successful. It survived the crash of Pyramid and the trauma that occurred in Victoria as a result of that crash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bendigo Building Society survived because of its prudent financial management and its concentration on the main game, providing funding for housing. It has gone from strength to strength and has recently been converted into a bank known as the Bendigo Bank. It has just had a successful launch and it is doing particularly well. However, there are a number of changes occurring throughout Australia in the financial world at the moment. There is a heavy emphasis on the big banks with them eyeing off with predatory eyes a lot of these regional banks. Time will tell what eventuates but we have seen some changes in Western Australia with the bank of Western Australia being taken over recently by a Scottish bank, and there will be more and more changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the role of lending for housing is not lost in these takeovers of regional banks. This facility is still a very important element of housing finance in Australia, in providing support for people who are requiring finance for the construction or purchase of a home. I will be watching the further reviews that will be carried out by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I could not be more pleased to see you in the chair for a debate of this nature, knowing your wide experience of commercial matters, particularly of futures markets and the like. You would be very adept at passing a stern eye over the objectives of the Trade Marks Bill 1995. I will restrict my comments as much as possible, as the opposition considers this bill to be essentially non-controversial, and we do not oppose the introduction of the new measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill represents the end of the line of a long process of overhauling Australian trademarks legislation. That process began in 1989 when the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business authorised the Registrar of Trade Marks to set up a working party to review existing legislation. That working party was chaired by the Registrar of Trade Marks and it included a mixed representation from the Trade Marks Office, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Patents Attorneys of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After working through a complicated process, including an initial phase of public consultation, the working party eventually produced its final report to the then minister in July 1992. The working party's report proposed the repeal of the Trade Marks Act 1995 and its replacement with a new act, incorporating several major changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there was a consensus within the working party on the majority of the report's recommendations, there was a small number of important issues on which the views of the Trade Marks Office representatives differed from those of the private sector representatives. Initially there was to be a further period of public consultation before new legislation would be drafted. However, in September 1992, a full four months before the proposed closing date for receipt of submissions, the then minister decided that he could not wait for public comments, but would proceed with new draft legislation forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister indicated that the legislation would follow the recommendations of the working party, except in areas where there had been disagreement between the representatives of the Trade Marks Office and the private sector representatives. In those areas the legislation would follow the recommendations of the Trade Marks Office's representatives, who were the minority on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early last year, the minister released an exposure draft of the 1994 bill. On the cover of that exposure draft it was said that the bill was in draft form and was not finally settled, and that one of the purposes of releasing it was to test it for errors and omissions. The original working party apparently had no involvement in drafting the bill. Although members of the working party received a copy prior to its release, there was no time to correct even the most obvious errors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 July last year, the minister issued a press release stating that the government would enact the 1994 bill without awaiting the results of the process of public consultation, the reason being that, under the agreement to establish the World Trade Organisation, Australia had to enact legislation consistent with the TRIPS agreement. Accordingly, the 1994 bill was debated and passed as part of a legislative package designed to ensure that Australia met its obligations under the agreement to establish the WTO. At the time however, the minister acknowledged the requirement to take account of public submissions on this issue and pledged to complete the process of consultation, before introducing amendments at the earliest possible opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that we are debating today is the outcome of that stretched process. It is largely a rewrite of the Trade Marks Act 1994, which has not yet come into effect. It makes a number of technical changes to the 1994 act to overcome drafting errors, but there are also a number of areas of substantial difference. In addition, there are a number of noteworthy areas of common ground between this bill and the 1994 act. I will make a few brief comments on those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that is worthy of comment is the expanded definition of a trademark provided in this bill. Under existing law, registrable trademarks have been largely confined to signs consisting of words, letters, numerals, figurative elements or a combination of one or more of these. The 1994 act provides for an expanded definition of a trademark and this bill goes slightly further. It is now proposed that a trademark may extend to include such things as an aspect of packaging, a shape, a colour, sound or scent. The 1992 working party report commented that, given recent developments in marketing and technology, there is a need for Australian legislation to cater for a wider range of signs than had previously been considered capable of functioning as a trademark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be noted that a broader definition is consistent with the direction of the TRIPS agreement and with recent changes in legislation in a number of industrialised nations. However, some aspects of the broader definition have raised concern that the scope of the new trademarks may now be too wide and that this could encroach on other areas of intellectual property. I note that one of the minor parties in the Senate put forward an amendment to restrict the definition of a trademark to a more conventional scope. They argued that by broadening the definition we would simply open the gates to legal challenge. According to their argument:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many manufacturers are already lining up to legally `try on' trademarks such as scents for perfume, or the fragrance of wine. While the current trademark regulators would exclude this, who knows what the future will bring or what the courts may decide? . . . This bill involves the reversal of the onus of proof, so that now the regulators must prove why a trademark should not be issued. This is of great significance in light of the inevitability of legal challenge on sensory labelling. It will result in substantial litigation costs. If trademarks referred to only conventional labels, however, the reversal would be quite appropriate in regulation of logos, names and so on.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition notes these concerns. However, in this instance we have decided not to tamper with the legislation. We accept the government's argument that there is sufficient international precedent to justify such a widening of the definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, we are satisfied that the provisions relating to the grounds for rejecting an application and the provisions relating to the grounds for opposing registration of a trademark provide sufficient safeguards against misuse of the expanded definition. In particular, I think that the requirement that a sign constituting a trademark must be able to be represented graphically is likely to severely constrain the scope of certain sounds or scents to be incorporated in such a registrable trademark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we do not believe that advances in marketing and technology should be unnecessarily constrained by government legislation. However, we will monitor the situation and look forward to industry feedback on the operation of the expanded scope of trademarks. Should it prove unworkable or lead to excessive litigation, an incoming coalition government will certainly be prepared to re-examine the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most significant features of this bill is the reversal of the onus of registrability which appears in section 33. According to the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is expressed in terms that make it clear that there is to be a presumption of registrability when an application is being examined by the Registrar of Trade Marks. This means that, if there is any doubt about whether a trademark should be registered, that doubt will be resolved in favour of the applicant rather than against the applicant as is now the case.</PARA>
<PARA>There should be considerable advantages in terms of minimising the cost to the applicant of complying with the requirements for registration and minimising the risks of wrongful rejection. The onus is placed squarely on the Registrar of Trade Marks to establish why a given trademark should not be registered. However, it is worth noting that the provisions dealing with the grounds for rejection of an application, sections 39 to 44, still leave the registrar with a considerable discretion. Moreover, the process of appeal is neither simple nor costless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my comments during last year's debate I indicated that a number of concerns with the original bill had been raised with me by practising patent and trademark attorneys. One of these related to the proposal to scrap the existing part B of the register of trademarks. The 1992 working party examined this issue and was of a divided opinion. Those members of the working party from the Law Council and the Institute of Patent Attorneys felt there were strong grounds for the retention of a divided register. They apparently based the view on the perceived significant advantages presently accorded part A registrations, the benefit of which should be accorded only to the proprietors of distinctive marks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the Trade Marks Office members of the working party felt that the advantages of retaining a divided register were largely illusory. Instead, they argued that there would be significant advantages in terms of cost and efficiency for both regulators and trademark users by streamlining the register into a single entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Law Council and the institute members acknowledged that a single register would reduce the administrative workload of the Trade Marks Office, they still felt that this was insufficient justification for extending monopoly rights and for changing a system which, on the face of it, had served Australia well for many years. Moreover, they argued that the GATT TRIPS agreement prescribed only minimal requirements for a register and that the maintenance of a divided register would not be inconsistent with Australia's international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition acknowledges that there are divided opinions on this issue. However, we accept that the historical reasons for maintaining a divided register probably no longer apply and that, on balance, the benefits of increased efficiency and reduced cost of administering an undivided register should outweigh any cost in terms of re-weighting of the rights of the trademark owners currently in different parts of the register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that was raised in relation to the 1994 act was a proposal to streamline the provisions relating to associated trademarks, these being trademarks used by a business which are substantially identical or similar and are used in relation to similar goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new bill goes even further. It scraps the concept of associated trademarks altogether. I note that this is a departure from the majority recommendation of the working report. In that report the Law Council and the institute members recommended the retention of the existing provisions for association&mdash;defined under the Trade Marks Act of 1955. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Law Council and institute members of the working party argued that the association system provides important information to trademark proprietors, enabling them to ascertain whether or not a set of trademarks can validly be transferred to another proprietor. They suggested that to repeal these provisions would upset the balance presently achieved between ensuring the validity of registrations and the efficiency of examination procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Trade Marks Office members of the working party agreed with the principle underlying the existing association provisions, they argued that existing provisions were cumbersome and resource intensive to administer and, further, that most other industrialised countries&mdash;including USA&mdash;have no association provisions in their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government justifies its decision to do away with associated trademarks altogether on the grounds that, firstly, it is consistent with international practice and, secondly, such action was supported by a majority of submissions received during the process of public consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition can see merit in the protection of the existing system of association. However, it is accepted that the costs of administering the system are probably disproportionate to consumer benefit on the grounds that there are other safeguards within the bill that offer protection against deception or confusion as a result of the change in ownership of the existing mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a final point I would like to comment briefly on the issue of registered users. Part II of the Trade Marks Act 1994 made provision for owners of trademarks to authorise use of their marks by registered users. This bill omits any provision for registered users. The second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that where owners of trade marks exercise control over use of their trade marks by other persons, that use can be taken to be use by the new owner . . . The WTO agreement does not require use under the control of the owner of the trade mark to be registered. Consequently, there is little benefit in retaining additional provisions for the registration of users.</PARA>
<PARA>The new provisions relating to authorised users appear to provide similar rights to those provided in the 1994 act for registered users, but without the same administrative costs and complexities. Under the new system, a greater weight of responsibility is placed on the registered owner and this may pose some potential problems if the owner is less than diligent in ensuring the appropriate use of trademarks under their control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire field of intellectual property is a complex one, and one which yields a range of competing interests. Consequently, trademark legislation, if it is to be in the best interests of Australian people, must seek to achieve a fair, equitable and efficient balancing of these competing interests. This bill has been through an extensive process of public consultation. It is to be hoped that, as a result, the opinions of all interested parties have at least been given adequate consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust this bill will give us a modern, workable system of trademarks. It is essential that we develop a system of trademarks which is responsive to the changing requirements of Australian industry, but which also pays heed to the interests of the consumer. I am not convinced that this bill is without potential problems. However, I can give an assurance that, in government, the coalition will be responsive to the best interests of trademark users and will certainly be prepared to amend any aspects of this legislation which prove to be defective in practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to enter this debate and to follow the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). I was in the chair at the commencement of his speech and he quite adventurously tried to inveigle me into the debate in that position. But I would have to acknowledge that under the tutelage of the honourable member for Ryan my knowledge of matters commercial has increased. Whilst I have tried not to be influenced by his ideological bent&mdash;and he has failed in that regard&mdash;I am indebted for small gems that he has taught me, such as the value of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS>, because it was always important that one should read publications like that&mdash;if only to know what influences your political enemies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I think this piece of legislation is interesting. It is an important aspect of commercial law. It is important not only for the protections that it gives to business but also, as has been said by both speakers so far in this debate today, for the protection that it can give to consumers. If we really want to understand the protections that are offered by trademarks it is important to have some understanding of the history surrounding them in our law and in the world of commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has played a significant role in the introduction of appropriate legislation throughout the history of the federation. When Alfred Deakin became Prime Minister for the second time in July 1905, it was with the support of the Australian Labor Party that the original legislation concerning the regulation of trademarks was passed. More generally, the Labor movement has consistently recognised the importance of protecting symbols which distinguish the products and work of individuals and groups of people from those of other individuals and groups, and their use in informing consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brewery Employees Union of New South Wales registered its own union label in 1906. The purpose of this union mark was to indicate that a particular good had been manufactured through the services of members of that union. The establishment of that time took a somewhat dim view of this practice and sought to stop it on the basis that the union mark was not a legitimate trademark. It is easy to see why the manufacturers at the time did not like these marks. With them, unions were able to demonstrate clearly to the consumers which goods and services had been produced with unionised labour. Trade union orientated consumers could then make their purchasing decisions based on the union label. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, the High Court held that the Commonwealth did not have the power constitutionally to make laws for marks used to identify the suppliers of services. Thus the union label was unable to be registered and was unprotected, and its intended purpose was stymied. Time altered this view, and it became generally accepted that subsequent legal decisions did not substantiate the original decision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to contemplate how things might have evolved differently had the High Court ruled in favour of the brewery employees back in the early 1900s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Trade Marks Office opened in Melbourne in 1906, the first day of trading saw 750 applications lodged: a strong indication that, even back then, Australians were a creative and resourceful lot. An interesting aspect of trademark legislation is that the Australian colonies implemented trademark protection some 10 years before Britain did, exemplifying that we are often ahead on legal reforms, too. Some of the earliest registered trademarks reflected the new status of the Commonwealth of Australia, which had been united and federated only five years earlier. The trademark images presented the new awareness of the national identity that Australians had discovered. Many trademarks consisted of maps and animal images common to all Australians, or of the Southern Cross or the Eureka flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, looking through the trademark register provides a unique opportunity to closely examine Australian history since Federation. Economic circumstances are mirrored in the numbers and types of trademarks registered, and trends and images of the times are always represented. During World War 1 and World War 11, registrations dipped dramatically and were followed by huge postwar increases as trade again flourished. Likewise, the pages are lean around the time of the Great Depression. This legislation moves to make our notion of trademarks even more contemporary. In this instance, it now includes sound, smell and aspects of packaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also of interest is the way in which people thought that they could perhaps market a product. One of the more interesting developments of a trademark and name was of course the naming of the product that we now all know as Vegemite. The merchant who tried to launch this vegetable extract back in 1923 decided that he would call the product `Parwill'. This product was, of course, to oppose the successful English spread&mdash;of that time and now&mdash;Marmite. The merchant chose the name `Parwill' because he was going to market it under the slogan, `Marmite, but Parwill.' Given even that there was perhaps a subtle difference in the sense of humour of the time, that pun failed to really take off, so it was decided to have a competition to name the new product, and that is the way that the Vegemite trademark and name came about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often, when people speak of the value of trademarks, they emphasise only the protection of the intellectual property aspects involved in the creation of the trademark and the protection of the rights of the owners of the trademark. However, the importance of a trademark needs to be recognised in terms not only of a name or image that it affords but also of the protection that the trademark offers to consumers. I believe that this aspect of trademarks legislation has been sadly neglected in the past, but I am pleased to see that the protection now offered to consumers was improved not only in the 1994 act but also in the bill now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that Minister Lee, in his second reading speech, said that Australian trademark laws served two complementary objectives: firstly, identification and protection of a business's products, and, secondly, protection of the consumer. In pamphlets and booklets that Ausindustry and AIPO publish, the value to the producers of trademarks is thus described:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your trade mark should distinguish your goods and services from your competitors by symbolising a certain image, quality and reputation that you want to create with the public.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a two-way street. The producer, manufacturer or supplier wants to identify something as its product; and, by having the trademark on a legislated basis, protection is given to consumers. Trademarks allow the consumer to know precisely what they are purchasing, thus preventing them from being deceived by false products and allowing them to make an informed judgment about what they will purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that outcome can be achieved only if we have a properly legislated and administered system&mdash;and, indeed, the policing that might flow from that. We know all too well of products that are sold either in the weekend markets of the cities and towns of Australia or even more predominantly in the street bazaars of countries overseas where the wrongful and deceitful use of well-known trademarks abounds. It is only through proper policing that the manufacturer is protected and the consumer has the protection of knowing that they are getting the proper goods that they believe they are purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is obviously not, and should never be, the sole protector of consumer rights, legislation allowing protected naming rights to one company forms part of the legislative arrangements which protect consumers. For example, this bill proposes to provide registration protection not only to the goods and services themselves but also to closely related or similar items. The Trade Practices Commission will, under this bill, assess whether the registration of certification would be to the public detriment. This means that certifications according to quality will not be open to misuse. Involvement of the TPC offers consumer protection in this aspect as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance, and taking on board some of the comments and criticisms that the shadow minister put on behalf of the coalition, I think that, in the same way that this legislation was developed, there will be a continuing review of the implementation of this bill from 1 January next year. That is always important. Another important aspect that has been mentioned in the debate is that this legislation continues to make contemporary the notion of a trademark, in the sense that we changed the notion of things that can be considered trademarks and of things that can be attached to goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is also contemporary because it acknowledges that now, in the world of commerce, Australia&mdash;through a whole host of measures, including its inclusion in the World Trade Organisation and the obligations that flow from that&mdash;must also have international considerations which would not only give protection to Australian products overseas but would likewise ensure that, when a product from overseas is brought into Australia, we can have a reasonable understanding that it is of a quality that goes with the trademark and associated symbols and identifications that the product has. With those short remarks, I am pleased to be able to speak in support of this bill. I am sure that, through the understanding that is developing, especially by consumers about their rights, this trademarks legislation will in its own small way assist consumers to make proper purchasing choices. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill proposes a number of amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 and the Public Service Act 1922 to implement the decision announced in the 1995-96 budget to amalgamate the Public Service Commission and the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will generate only modest savings of approximately $200,000 in 1996-97 and subsequent years, the government considers that significant benefits will result from the arrangements proposed in this bill. By drawing on the collective experience of both organisations and rationalising their corporate resources, the amalgamated body, which will be known as the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, will be better placed to develop innovative personnel management and service delivery arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will provide the public service, and the people of Australia generally, with tangible benefits. The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission will bring together two vital streams of people management in the public sector and create an environment in which systemic issues which are brought to light in the grievance and appeals handling process can more effectively inform and improve the policy perspectives of the Public Service Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, integration with the Public Service Commission will provide staff of the agency with a better appreciation of the policy issues relevant to their casework activities. By drawing together the Public Service Commission's work on best practice and the MPRA's experience in merit protection and grievance resolution, the new commission's ability to contribute to the delivery of quality service to the Australian public will be greater than the sum of its individual parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government remains committed to the principles on which the MPRA was established and which are articulated in its legislation&mdash;fairness, equity, sound personnel management practices, efficiency and good staff relations. The MPRA has an important role in preserving key values in Australian government employment and, in particular, in preserving the merit system. In the first 11 years, the MPRA has developed an enviable reputation for probity and independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing this legislation, the government has been careful to ensure that the Public Service Commissioner and the Director of the MPRA, who will in future be known as Merit Protection Commissioner, will continue to exercise their statutory powers independently of each other. The powers of the MPRA in relation to the investigation of grievances and the resolution of disputes will be unaffected by these amendments, and it will be just as vigorous in protecting public servants' rights as it has always been. The government's intention is that the two commissioners should have a close and cooperative relationship, but that neither will be able to interfere in the other's statutory role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One necessary consequence of the amalgamation of the staff of the Public Service Commission and the MPRA, however, is that the Merit Protection Commissioner will no longer have the powers of a secretary in relation to the staff of the MPRA. Those powers will rest with the Public Service Commissioner, but the government expects the Public Service Commissioner to delegate his personnel management powers in relation to the staff of the commission who are required for the purposes of the Merit Protection Act to the Merit Protection Commissioner. This will guarantee the continued independence of the MPRA from the Public Service Commission and ensure that there will be no diminution in the rights of public servants to independent appeal and grievance mechanisms as a result of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill makes a number of other minor changes to the act. Members of the Merit Protection and Review Agency will continue to be appointed by the Governor-General in Council, on ministerial advice. However, the bill will require wider consultation on these appointments than is currently the case. In addition, the bill provides that only the Merit Protection Commissioner will be able to be appointed on a full-time basis. This in fact has been the situation since the MPRA was established in 1984 and the amendment does no more than reflect the reality of the current practice. I commend this bill to the House. I think the explanatory memorandum has already been presented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry that I rose to speak before the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters (Mr Johns), but the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill has been listed and withdrawn so many times, I did not want to miss it. As it came through the barrier this time, it had to be got. The opposition supports the legislation but we have a number of caveats in relation to some of its functioning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was listening to the minister expound the virtues of putting together the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission. He said that there would be modest savings and I certainly agree with that. In expounding those virtues, he has reflected on the goodwill that will be required by the two commissioners to get on under the same roof. I note that one has somewhat lesser powers than the other and, because of the very nature of the beast, inevitably, one will dominate the proceedings, no matter what happens. We will be waiting to see how this particular exercise and that relationship pans out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware that the report of the Public Service Act review group&mdash;the McLeod report&mdash;which was released in January, did not recommend this merger with the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Whether the goodwill that the minister was talking about prevails or whether the interests of the Public Service are downgraded is something that will only be seen in time. The McLeod review recommended that the merit agency remain separate. The agency itself, by its nature, is a joint union and management body, whereas the Public Service Commission is all about management structure. While the two are somewhat complementary, they are, of themselves, very different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are there to look at the way in which a public servant can achieve some rectification of his complaint, which, in essence, would be about the administration of the Public Service Commission. The argument that would follow from that is that, if they are housed in the same area and with perhaps no goodwill between the two commissioners, that might lead to a situation where the public servant is not appropriately looked after. When we are in government, we would certainly monitor the progress of this and note its outcome. If it is not acting in the best interests of the Public Service, quite clearly, we would revisit the McLeod review recommendations and see what could best be done in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the opposition supports the legislation, there are a couple of issues that I would like to raise as it relates to the Public Service. This particular issue was raised by my colleague Senator Minchin at a Senate estimates committee hearing on 26 May. Ms Forward, the director of the MPRA, was being asked about this change that is coming and about the government's intention to merge the MPRA with the Public Service Commission. Senator Minchin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were you given the opportunity for consultations about the advantages or disadvantages of this prior to a decision being made or was it something you read about in the newspaper?</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Forward responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither of these reflects the facts of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>That quite clearly indicates that she did not have much of an input into what was going to happen. Despite the fact that the McLeod review made a recommendation one way, the head of the commission obviously was not consulted, by the comments that she made to the Senate committee. I assume it was a straight government situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the MPRA or its principal officers feel a greater degree of consultation was required before the decision on the agency's future was taken. That this consultation did not occur is a reflection on this government's commitment to both the principles and the practices of open government. If the government is unwilling to enter into consultations with its own employees, it is little wonder that the general public is somewhat cynical of its advocacy of open government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Forward was hardly enthusiastic about the proposal when she was asked by Senator Bell what this move would achieve. In response to Senator Bell's claim that this bill returned the situation to that which applied before the agency was established in 1984, Ms Forward simply stated that would achieve savings of $214,000 in the year after next. This is far from enthusiastic endorsement of the bill from the most senior public servant in that area. That this response was forthcoming is hardly surprising. In the 1993-94 annual report of the MPRA, warnings against the loss of independence were made. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the continued availability of independent external review is pivotal to the effect of merit protection. With devolution of responsibility away from the central agencies and central offices . . . the need for independent external review becomes more important, both to protect the employment rights of employees and to ensure accountability for personal management decisions and actions.</PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Auditor-General provides independent external review of financial management, and the Ombudsman and various tribunals provide similar functions in respect of decisions affecting citizens, so too an independent body to review the personnel management of the Commonwealth's employees is needed to provide the Parliament and other stakeholders with the assurances of fairness, equity and merit in public employment.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the agency is wary of attempts by the government to compromise its independence. In supporting this legislation, this parliament has an obligation to ensure it serves the interests of both Commonwealth employees and those who fund its operations&mdash;that is, the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of the view that the MPRA, as part of the Public Service Commission, will be required to adjudicate on grievances arising from rules determined by the Public Service Commission itself and that this will have potential conflict of interest implications. This is a situation which the MPRA, the PSC and the government should seek to avoid. A second concern relates to the level of resources that will be available to the MPRA in its new form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation relies in part on the view that the implementation of the McLeod proposals will result in a decline of the agency's workload and a consequent decline in the levels of required resources. While this may be true, the detail of legislation to give effect to these reforms has yet to be disclosed. Even though the minister has spoken in general terms of the government's intentions for the Public Service Act, this legislation is not available. Until this occurs, we await the specific details to ensure the commitment to resources will be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assessing the future of the MPRA it would be remiss of me not to examine one of the most contentious issues to emerge in recent years in the area of public sector employment. The MPRA has been the subject of criticism as a result of its investigation into allegations of workplace harassment at the Australian War Memorial. The subjects of that inquiry&mdash;the former director and the former deputy director&mdash;are seeking a Federal Court ruling to prevent the minister from considering the MPRA report on these allegations. While I have no intention of canvassing the details of that case, it should be noted that both the former executives claim that the MPRA exceeded its authority, and that they were denied natural justice and procedural fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 August, less than seven weeks ago, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> carried a story headed `Public servants lose bid for harassment challenge funding'. That report quoted Mr Kelson. He drew a very clear distinction between the government's approach in that case and its approach in the case of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), who is gaining financial support in the Marks royal commission, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From my perspective I can't help but look at the treatment of someone like Carmen Lawrence where the Commonwealth bends over backwards to do everything that can make sure that she doesn't have to pay her costs in a matter that doesn't even relate to the performance of her federal responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here are two officers who were forced into litigation to protect their interests in the course of doing their jobs as federal employees and they are told that the cost is not a hardship.</PARA>
<PARA>It is somewhat ironic that three weeks after that story appeared the government revealed that it had reconsidered its position. The more cynical amongst us could be excused for thinking that this change of mind had more to do with the government's reaction to the Lawrence case than it had to do with ensuring a fair hearing for the executives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, now that this matter appears to be resolved and a decision is awaited, a number of questions relating to the MPRA need to be resolved. It must be explained whether or not the MPRA simply went trawling through the Australian War Memorial to justify bringing a case against the executives. The minister has a responsibility to advise whether or not the agency approached him seeking an invitation to conduct the inquiry into the War Memorial and when this occurred. If this was not the case, the minister must explain the conditions under which he requested the agency to investigate the relevant matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did he make any approaches to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, his department or the Australian War Memorial before a decision was taken to hold the inquiry? Irrespective of the outcome of any court proceedings, this information ought to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of even greater long-term importance and central to the MPRA's role within the Public Service are the standards to be followed by the agency in fulfilling its obligations. In effect, what standard does the MPRA follow in determining whether workplace harassment has occurred? Is it the standard set by the minister when he said that harassment must not be confused with legitimate comment and advice, including relevant negative comment or feedback, or is it the standard set out by the agency in an article appearing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11 and 12 March 1995 which referred to `any type of behaviour that can reasonably be expected to cause a person to feel threatened, uncomfortable or unable to cope with their work environment'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this matter needs to be resolved so the agency and the public servants who are supposed to assist know precisely where they stand. I urge the minister to advise the committee of the correct position. To fail to do so can only be regarded as a dereliction of duty. If this determination depends on the outcome of the current legal action, I would urge the minister to consider any necessary legislative changes at the time of the redrafting of the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition supports the bill, but we call upon the minister to answer the comments that I have made about the War Memorial case and to be aware that the coalition will monitor progress of the new arrangements as outlined in the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 which is before the Main Committee today. This is an area of considerable importance for members of parliament because of the way in which it affects the whole mechanism and operation of the government of Australia. The Australian Public Service has always played a very valuable role in impartially, competently and professionally administering the programs of Australian governments since the time of Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been particularly fortunate in the history of its public service. We have always been favoured with a public service which has acted in the most competent and professional manner and, therefore, the Australian public have justifiably had a great deal of confidence in that professionalism. They have come to rely on it in a way which is almost invisible. It is a very effective mechanism in this country which we inherited from the Westminster process of the United Kingdom and which has served this country particularly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is very important, whenever we are examining potential changes to that framework, that we should give it the closest scrutiny. I know it is the government's intention that any aspect of this legislation should operate so as to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Public Service and not in any way to derogate that. I think it is quite vital that, as members of parliament, whatever our political persuasion, we are mindful of the need to ensure accountability and openness in the public service and enhance the professionalism of that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, because of the size of Australia and the Australian government's operations, it is a very large and complex service and, because of the way in which government business is undertaken these days, that is necessarily the case. The Public Service has evolved considerably from the early days of its operation and, of course, it would not be practical to continue with the kinds of structures, policies and philosophies which underlay the Public Service at the time of Federation&mdash;or, indeed, which were inherited from the United Kingdom prior to that&mdash;into the 1990s, given the very dramatic and sweeping changes which have occurred to the administration of government since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that process has also got to be directed towards an internal review of the mechanisms of the Public Service itself and a constant reassessment that those legislative frameworks are appropriate to the Public Service that we have today and the objectives which we would want to set as a government and as a parliament for that Public Service, as distinct from those which have pertained in the past and which, while they may have been relevant in those days, may well be less relevant today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I think it is very instructive to look back at some of the comments which have been made about the Public Service over the years. On an historical basis, of course, the public has not always been kind to the Public Service in general, but I think that understates the contribution which that service makes and the manner in which it is required to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service has traditionally been required to act in a background mode, if you like, and not take an up-front role in a public sense. It is not meant to be part of a media campaign. It is meant to be a Public Service providing efficient and effective advice behind the scenes to governments in a way which will not detract from the operation of our democracy and that is quite a vital part of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we examine the role of the public service over that period, commentators, even as far back as 1872, when dealing with the British public service of the day, could be quoted in lines such as `it is an inevitable defect that bureaucrats will care more for routine than for results'. Now, that kind of thing may have been true in the past, but it is something which we have to guarantee is not true in the current context. A similar commentator at that time observed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the world of civil service plunging into action is the arch crime . . . the civil servant's duty is not to achieve desirable results; it is to follow the correct procedure.</PARA>
<PARA>It is that kind of mentality, of over 100 years ago, which I think has often underlain public appreciation in recent decades for the Public Service. It is an image which the Public Service has successfully shaken off in recent times and one which I think this legislation will go some way towards enhancing, as will the review of the Public Service Act, which the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters (Mr Johns) has commissioned and which is under way now. The latest version of that bill, when it becomes available, will incorporate many of the kinds of changes which we would see as desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how has the model of the Public Service changed since the days of those earlier quotations? Those models have had to adapt to changes in society and to our expectations of government and government service. Government now is much more democratic. The public is somewhat better educated than was the case a century or more ago when those quotations were applicable and, of course, people have much greater expectations of what the government will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of that flows from the increased role of government, because the more government does, the more people will continue to expect from it. The greater availability of the mass media in promoting and explaining to the public, particularly at election times, the commitments that people make about the Public Service is very relevant to that process. It creates a climate of expectation, which obviously the public will expect to see reflected in the Public Service and the kinds of services it produces for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that period the public has come to expect that we will have a modern public service in which democracy, efficiency and equity are the kinds of underlying principles. They were the values of the late Dr Peter Wilenski, a very noted and prominent public servant in this country, who gave many years of service to his nation and is honoured in the Wilenski memorial lectures, which often revolve around Public Service oriented management topics. That is the kind of public service that he would have supported and did support in his time. I believe it is one which encapsulates the kinds of values which we would expect for our Public Service today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have also seen change over that period of time is the way in which program objectives and guidelines are much more clearly defined for the Public Service than they were in the past. In days when the role of the Public Service and that of the government were somewhat less than they are now, the programs were far less complex and public servants' areas of discretion would have been much reduced. Ministers were able to be accountable for the total range of actions of their public servants because the programs in contemplation were far less wide-ranging and far less complex, and the legislation which underpinned them was far more capable of comprehension than, sadly, it often is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation that prevails in the 1990s is that, with the best will in the world, legislation is still very complex; it covers a wide variety of contingencies because of the potential of people to seek to evade some of its terms and the need to explain its terms in great detail. That has led to a situation where public servants are often placed in a position of having to take discretionary decisions, and the public of course has come to see them in some cases as decision makers rather than necessarily just decision takers from a minister who is actually accountable for the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are able in the modern context to much more comprehensively set out program objectives and guidelines for the Public Service, we will to some extent reduce the uncertainty which public servants have in administering those programs and ensure that their personal preferences and priorities do not unnecessarily and unhelpfully intrude into that decision making process. It is essential that ministers decide and advisers advise, and that the way in which they do that is based on a very comprehensive outline of precisely what the policy is that the government would have them implement. It is also essential that the public understands that process to be one which is firmly based in efficiency, democracy and equity, as I said before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, given the complexity of modern management, I do not think it is possible for us to expect that public servants will always be seen in a totally nonpartisan light unfortunately, because many of the decisions which they need to make are often translated into political and community decision making processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at simple issues such as the opening times of a library, for example, that is often a decision taken by a public servant&mdash;be that at the local, state or federal level. Those issues about opening hours, simple service delivery questions, often become very political. Anyone who has served as I have in local government will know that issues like the opening times of libraries or the opening times of rubbish collection facilities and so on, all of those kinds of what we would see as very technical and public service management matters, can often take on a very political characteristic. It is one which now cannot be avoided, given the drive for efficiency and accountability in these processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not allow that to sidetrack us from the need for efficiency and effectiveness. The House of Representatives expenditure committee&mdash;and I now have the honour to serve on the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration which has succeeded the expenditure committee&mdash;when it was looking at these kinds of issues as far back as l979, said that there seemed to be little point in having efficiently run programs which fail to effectively achieve the end results or the outputs that are desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the committee wrote about this as far back as 1979, it is a very timely reminder of the way in which we have to ensure that the purpose of government intervention in some aspects of the community's affairs is reflected not only in the legislation and in the program guidelines and models which government approves for the operation of the Public Service but also in the outcomes of the Public Service program&mdash;and in a way so that the public can appreciate, at the end of the day, that the outcome is a response to the drive for efficiency and democracy in their programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one also has to include in the 1990s process the recognition of the need for an assessment of equity, because equity is something that we are all very conscious of now. In terms of the Public Service, though, when it was developed in the last century equity was seen only to mean a reference to treating all people equally: all before the law were equal and one did not favour one person over another in any way, shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service has cultivated this ethic extremely well over the last 100 years and has done so almost to a fault, because, of course, ultimately society has come to recognise the need to ensure that equity goes beyond simply equal treatment. It means far more than this and, unless it means more than this, many of the objectives of government programs&mdash;the outputs about which I spoke a moment ago&mdash;will not be properly achieved. One has to relate very closely the outcomes that one seeks to achieve from a program to the equity objectives of the program because, while you can offer all programs identically to all people, the purpose of the government's intervention in the first place will not necessarily be achieved unless the focus is on the equity objectives of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The modern interpretation of equity, of course, is to ensure that the approach which is administered by the program treats the needs and requirements of people equally so that those who have differing needs, requirements and abilities to benefit from programs receive the kind of assistance under the program that they need to benefit equally with others in that program. This is quite a different approach because it may not simply be the case that all members of the public can take advantage of a particular legal right that they may have without in some cases being given the benefit, for example, of legal aid in order to gain advantage from the program. The program will not achieve its equity objectives and its output objectives unless we have recourse to additional assistance for some members of the public to properly allow them to take part in the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we address this need we will not achieve the kinds of outcomes which we need for the Public Service. Along with the relatively minor changes which we are making to Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 today&mdash;but in contemplation of the other changes which will be made in the broader context of the Public Service review&mdash;we have to look at all these approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the extent of the Public Service in the modern climate, it is also very appropriate that we should examine the way in which the Public Service deals with equity on an internal basis as well as on an external basis. Indeed, this is a particular focus of some of the amendments which are before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxpayers, of course, are demanding greater value from government these days and they are expecting it to achieve its internal processes in a much more efficient manner so that the public itself can benefit more from the available resources rather than see these at least partly consumed by internal processes. This is the kind of logic and ethic which has driven the efficiency dividend in recent years and it is one which will continue for some time to come. It is the need for internal efficiency and equity which drives the changes which we have before us today. Indeed, the bill which we are currently examining gives effect to the government's decision, announced in the 1995-1996 budget, to amalgamate the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision is based on a wider series of examinations of the Public Service as a whole, some of which are reflected in this legislation, some of which are reflected in the announced intention of government policy and some which will come forward in the review of the Public Service Act which the minister commissioned last year and which, of course, is presently being conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service Merit Review and Protection Agency has been in existence for some time. It has 56 full-time staff positions and a running cost budget for 1995-96 of approximately $6.5 million. This is a very substantial agency by any determination, and one which plays a vital role in ensuring that internal Public Service processes are seen to be equitable and fair. But in the pursuit of that goal, it is essential that we do not sacrifice too much of the effectiveness and efficiency processes which a modern public service also demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McLeod review, on which these recommendations are based, quite properly took account of the need to balance those competing requirements and to produce an outcome which will be internally consistent and fair to the Public Service, and to the officers who are committed to serving the government of the day&mdash;whatever government that may be&mdash;and the public of Australia in an equitable and appropriate manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined agency, with the changed guidelines under which it operates, will certainly be in a better position to do that. There can be no greater commitment to the public service than to the internal fairness of its operations. Merit selection is at the heart of the whole basis of our Public Service; that government employment practices are fair, open and subject to review is something which is quite inescapable in a modern democracy. Any hint that we are departing from that process of merit selection and indulging in nepotism or favouritism of any kind would reflect very badly on the Public Service. It is essential that we ensure the highest standards of accountability within the Public Service as well as without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is very relevant to that topic, as will be the broader review of the Public Service Act presently under way. It is essential that we see these measures as part of an overall package; otherwise we will not appreciate the full flavour of the government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those fundamental criteria-fairness, openness and review processes&mdash;will be preserved by this legislation. But they will be enacted in a form which is more internally consistent and ensures internal efficiencies of operation. Programs are required to move quickly and speedily these days. It is not possible to have protracted reviews where these are not serving the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will seek to ensure that the public interest is protected while, at the same time, guaranteeing that Public Service appointments, promotions and reviews, higher duties, appeals and the like, are all examined in a full, fair and open light. There will be accountability and independence, in a way which ensures that the process itself is accountable and efficient. Although it is never an easy process to balance those kinds of criteria, this legislation seeks to do so, and I believe it does so appropriately. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that we support this legislation is that the turning of the recommendations of the McLeod report into legislation is the precursor to the main game&mdash;legislation that this parliament is yet to see and for which we are all waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the suggestions in the McLeod report were aimed at streamlining the way in which the Public Service operates. The opposition has sufficient confidence in public servants to realise that they do a very good job when left alone to administer day-to-day administrative affairs . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed merger of the Public Service Commission and the MPRA will allow a streamlining of the appeals functions that go on inside the Public Service. But the new agency must be left alone, and the opposition trusts the government when it says that the effectiveness of the MPRA will not in any way be compromised by amalgamation or hindered by a lack of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an ex-public servant, I can say that there is some fear in the Public Service community, given recent events concerning the Australian War Memorial, where the MPRA was actually used as an offensive weapon by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service Matters (Mr Johns) who, if reports are to be believed, did not even tell the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), whose portfolio covers the Australian War Memorial, that an inquiry&mdash;which could only be described as some sort of trawling expedition&mdash;was to be launched into the conduct of two senior public servants. The call for the inquiry was quite extraordinary because the minister responsible did not know of it. If the reports are to be believed, he had no advance warning and was not allowed any input into the brief that the MPRA was given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are indeed many questions which are yet to be answered as to why Brendan Kelson and Michael McKernan were investigated and why, at a time when this federal government was quite keen to dish out legal aid money, these two senior public servants, who had served successive governments very well, were initially denied legal aid to continue their legal defence. There have been many articles written about this and I am sure members present are aware of the matter. One of our major concerns is that the impartiality of the new Public Service and Merit Protection Commission is in no way jeopardised by political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads to the questions that are yet to be answered about the entire way in which the Public Service is being administered. There have been recent comments about the effectiveness of the Public Service, and to my mind, and to the minds of many on this side of the House, that is really a reflection on the way in which this government has been handling the Public Service. In fact, it is a reflection on this government's attitude to the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's budget was very unclear&mdash;and it is even more unclear three months into the new financial year&mdash;about Public Service job losses. At the time, I think the figure of 4,000 public servant job losses was bandied around. The number of positions that were to disappear because of this year's budget was a great concern to people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I put my concerns in a letter to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service Matters, to get some understanding of what this year's budget implications were for public servants. The letter I got back was quite extraordinary; the minister did not know. The letter says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yet again, it would appear that public servants are paying for the government's failure. Obviously, I had to go further and ask the ministers responsible. I put questions on notice in late June to all the ministers and, as yet, I have not received a single response about this government's expected Public Service cuts for this financial year. It is absolutely extraordinary that, three months into a new financial year and five months past the budget date, we still do not know what this year's budget means to Public Service numbers. Is it that they do not know or that they are just not willing to say? Given the interest displayed in the bill by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), perhaps they could question the ministers responsible and assist me by getting an answer for my constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the truth? We have numerous comments from those opposite about the Public Service and we are worried about the future of the Public Service in this city under another Keating government. There are no answers so far. A few months ago, I was asked to stand up for Canberra by Senator McMullan because of the rumours that departments and Public Service numbers would be cut under a John Howard government. The extraordinary thing is that Public Service numbers have been cut and Public Service numbers and bodies have been moved out of the ACT. This has not been done under the coalition. It has been done under this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and under this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have moved out in the term of this government. It is quite extraordinary when you look at the numbers of jobs that have been lost and the dozen or so public service bodies that have been removed from the ACT or, indeed, the bodies with national functions that perhaps should have come to the ACT. For example, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was moved to Sydney. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal went to Brisbane. The Industry Commission went to Melbourne. Australian Defence Industries went to Sydney. Australia Post's national stamp collection was moved to Melbourne. The CSIRO headquarters was moved to Melbourne. The National Aviation College went to Tasmania when reports suggested that it should have been in Canberra. Then there was the attempt to move the National Maritime Safety Authority out of Canberra to Newcastle, but the government backed down under pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises the question: what would happen to Public Service numbers and what would happen to government departments were this government to be returned for another term? They actually campaigned heavily in the ACT in the 1993 election on this issue, claiming that the coalition would seemingly clear-fell the ACT. Yet what we have here is an obvious indication that it is the Labor Party that has been affecting the ACT. They are the ones that have been sacking public servants and they are the ones that have been moving out the departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government's position on the future of the Public Service and the public servants in the ACT? The McLeod report, which was brought down in January this year, has not yet been answered. We are told we may see the legislation in this session or we might see it next year. I wonder if that would be after an election?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other issues about the Public Service. Indeed, the former member for Canberra, when she came back to campaign&mdash;on her one and only outing&mdash;during the by-election, made the claim that if people voted for the Liberal Party, or if a Liberal Party member was returned for the seat of Canberra, the Liberal Party would clear-fell the ACT. What did the people of Canberra think about this little claim? They thought that was so reputable and they thought so highly of that comment that they produced the biggest by-election swing in 60 years. This is public servants voting for a Liberal candidate. If you have worked inside the Public Service and you know what is going on inside the Public Service, you will know that public servants are sick of the way they are being treated by this government. </PARA>

I would like to reiterate a statement that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made during the Canberra by-election and it is relevant to the question of public servants. When speaking of the coalition's attitude towards the Australian Public Service, John Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We don't only represent, as we proudly do, the interests of small business and the interests of private enterprise but we also represent those hundreds of thousands of Australian men and women who work in a very effective, faithful and conscientious way in both the state and federal public services and, as I've said on an earlier occasion, you don't advance the cause of the private sector by denigrating the public sector. The public sector has an honoured place. It provides many important services and it is comprised of hundreds of thousands of men and women of enormous commitment and dedication to the future of this country.</PARA>

I was in the public service when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister and did we not have a lovely time then in the public sector! It was industrially unruly. Certainly in the history of the Public Service there were more industrial disputes in the period 1976 to 1983 than in any other period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether or not that is true. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer there were terms like `the Phil Lynch razor gang' and `snouts in the trough'. There were allegations that public servants were bludgers and we had the famous name `dole bludgers' for the unemployed. Those were all very much flavour of the month expressions in the late 1970s under the Fraser government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives effect to the government's decision announced in the l995-96 budget to amalgamate the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. Presumably, it will be known as the PSMPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service Commission was set up in 1987 following the 1987 election. Massive changes were made in the public service on Bastille Day, 14 July, 1987, when a number of smaller departments were amalgamated into super-departments such as DEET, as we call it now, and Human Services and Health which was called Community Services and Health. It is fair to say that some of the decisions at the time did cause concern amongst public servants, in particular the trade unions who have not always agreed with anything that any government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the significant changes in l987 was the abolition of the Public Service Board and the devolution of the functions of the Public Service Board to individual departments&mdash;responsibility for selection procedures and recruiting, et cetera. Also, many of the functions of the Public Service Board were passed on to the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Finance and the newly formed Public Service Commission, which was a much smaller version of what had been the Public Service Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service Commission has approximately 150 staff. The other half of the equation is the Merit Protection and Review Agency which was set up by the Hawke government in 1984 and commenced operating from 1 July l985. The MPRA brought together a number of other smaller bodies such as the Promotions Appeal Committee, the Disciplinary Appeal Board and the Redeployment and Retirement Appeal Committee, which needed to be brought in after the Fraser government's redeployment and retirement legislation. The MPRA also deals with a number of other public service matters, such as grievances, under the various public service regulations. It is a very important part of the Public Service, as has already been said today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right of appeal against promotions, as the member for Canberra correctly pointed out, is a very important part of equity and the merit principle in the public service. We have not always had the merit principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inform the member for Canberra that, under the Fraser government and governments before the Fraser government, it was all about equal efficiency and seniority. Indeed, in the past I had the good fortune to win two appeals in the Promotions Appeal Committee. In the first situation, another person was put onto long-term higher duties ahead of me on the basis that he was senior; he had been there for 30 years and I had only been there for 12 years. I managed to knock him over in the Promotions Appeal Committee, but I will come back to that. There were concerns about some of the changes that were made in the 1980s and there were concerns in 1986 when, under the streamlining provisions, access to the Promotions Appeal Committee was limited to fairly junior officers and up to middle management officers. In today's language, access was granted up to the level of ASO 6. Senior officers and senior executive service officers do not have access to the Promotions Appeal Committee, but they do have access to the Merit Protection and Review Agency for grievances and other matters to do with process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The merit principle is important and it is enshrined in the Public Service Act. I particularly refer to section 33, which talks about prohibition of patronage and favouritism, and, of course, section 33.3 deals with all forms of discrimination. I used to teach people about these things in the Public Service. Discrimination is illegal on the grounds of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, religion, age, marital status, pregnancy, social origin, ethnic origin and physical or mental disability. There is one other form of discrimination and it will come back to me in a minute. The words `mental disability' worry me a bit. As I said only a week ago in this chamber, the words used should be `intellectual and psychiatric disability'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Promotions Appeal Committee&mdash;and, indeed, the MPRA itself&mdash;is there to protect public servants against discrimination, patronage and favouritism and it is very important that the committee be maintained. The committee has been maintained&mdash;albeit in a different form since it will be amalgamated with the Public Service Commission&mdash;and its integrity is maintained, which is a very important thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were concerns raised by the Community and Public Sector Union as to whether this legislation ensured the independence of the MPRA and concerns were also raised about resourcing matters, as has been pointed out already. However, I understand that there were discussions and that the concerns were largely overcome in this legislation. This legislation does protect the independence of the MPRA&mdash;and the Public Service Commission, for that matter&mdash;and it does not have any adverse resource implications for these bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own experience in the public sector was as a trade unionist in the Department of Health. As a unionist, obviously I had to represent people who had been discriminated against. I also experienced discrimination myself&mdash;usually because of my trade union activities&mdash;and sometimes I was given a hard time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1979 through to 1993 when I was elected to the House of Representatives, I was only promoted once in the Public Service without the need for an appeal. A job came up and the selection criteria required that I sit an aptitude test. Obviously I did fairly well because I got the job. Whenever a promotion was up to a selection panel of Public Service managers in the department I never seemed to score a promotion, but, on a couple of occasions, I did manage to take the matter to the Promotions Appeal Committee&mdash;once, as I have described, on the basis of long-term higher duties, when I was passed over because the other person was more senior. This situation can no longer occur under this government's reforms, but it was very much the go under conservative governments in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Promotions Appeal Committee was created by a Labor government&mdash;the Chifley government&mdash;back in the late 1940s. A fairly important point to remember is that this decision arose out of the sectarianism that dominated the Public Service in those days; it was rife. Depending on which department you were in, you either had to be a Catholic or a Mason to get promotion in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Catholics and Masons are not known for loving each other or particularly liking each other, but there was an unwritten power-sharing agreement between the Catholics and Masons. Depending on which department you were in, you were either one or the other. You would be in a department that was either a Mason stronghold or a Catholic stronghold, and you were usually looked after. If you were neither Catholic nor Mason, you were in a bit of trouble in the Public Service in those days. You also had to be a male, as I recall, to get on in the Public Service because, before 1949, women could not be promoted. They could not even get into what was then the third division until 1949. In fact, until 1966, if you were a female in the Public Service and you got married, that was no good. You had to either `live in sin', as it was called then, or resign or become a temporary employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things have come a long way in the Public Service under this government, I am pleased to say. We have preserved the Promotion Appeals Committee which was set up in the late 1940s to overcome sectarian bias within the Public Service. As I said, I was fortunate not only to win two appeals myself but also to help a number of union members whom I represented, by preparing their cases and enabling them to have successful appeals&mdash;which I thought was a pretty rewarding part of what I used to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second occasion when I won an appeal was in 1989. Ironically enough, it was for the position that I had held previously but that was being upgraded: of all things, the position of equal employment opportunity officer. I was passed over for that job and was rated unsuitable because management did not want me in a job like that when I was a union delegate, and that is basically what it came down to. I was rated unsuitable, but I fronted up to the appeal and was unanimously successful, which was very unusual and did not really please the department very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an illustration of the fact that it is important to have the merit principle, that it is enforced and that there are safeguards. I note with interest the concern and the scaremongering in the community about the government's unfair dismissal legislation as it affects the private sector. How dare we have due process in the private sector, and how dare we have a fair go for people who are wrongfully dismissed! I do not believe that any employer has anything to fear from due process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, there are times when you have to sack somebody if they have done the wrong thing, and there are also provisions in the Public Service now for people to be disciplined and eventually dismissed if they have done the wrong thing: if they have stolen or they have hit somebody or whatever. There are procedures to be gone through, and those procedures should also apply in the private sector. If somebody has done the wrong thing or, for whatever reason, an employer has fair and reasonable grounds to dismiss somebody, then they can do that. But I also think that there are plenty of times when that is not the case, and that people should have a right to be represented in a due process, and that is why we have the unfair dismissal legislation. It is also why in the public sector we have, and we need to have, the existence of the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the merit principle enforced, as it is to a large extent because of the provisions of the Public Service Act, and section 33 in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this legislation. As with a lot of other pieces of legislation in the Public Service over the years, there are always concerns about change and sometimes they are quite justified concerns. I must admit that, in the past, with another hat on as a trade unionist and as an employee in the public sector, I have not always welcomed some of these changes. But you can fairly say that the Public Service today is far more efficient and better managed than it was in 1983, when this government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I do have a pretty long memory about the Public Service: I have been a public servant since the early 1970s and I have been active in the trade union movement in the Public Service since the late 1970s, so I have a memory of some of these issues. It is fair to say that the Public Service, warts and all, is more efficient today. Nothing is perfect, but we do have a very efficient Public Service with a lot of hardworking people, as the member for Canberra pointed out, and the existence of the MPRA goes a long way towards ensuring that that remains the case. I believe it will continue to be the case under this legislation, which, of course, amalgamates the MPRA with the Public Service Commission. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because most of the points that need to be made about the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 have already been made. This is a turbulent time in management in the public and private sectors. There has been a lot of debate about how to encourage the growth of efficiency whilst retaining humanity and effectiveness and an orientation towards meeting the goals of organisations. That kind of debate has occurred just as much in large private organisations as within public ones. I do not think the debate has, in any sense, concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a tendency for some people to say that the public sector should be treated in exactly the same way as the private sector. I question that. The goals of private organisations and public sector organisations, or the public service at least, are significantly different. The public sector is there to deliver goals, to serve the public, to make accessible the services that are best provided in common with the whole community and to do that in a way that ensures that they are accessible, equitably available and effectively and efficiently delivered. To a large extent the private sector overlaps with that but, of course, their bottom line is making a profit. In a sense, the goals are narrower. Equity does not have to be one of the goals of the private sector. Accessibility is important but it does not have to be a top priority in the way it does in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public sector should, by definition, be working for the common good while private enterprise is working for shareholders, for management and employees and also for consumers. A good private enterprise will have a balance between those goals but that balance is not always as well achieved as it might be, any more than in the public sector the balance between efficiency, effectiveness, accessibility and equity are achieved as well as they ought be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we continue with this debate about how best to deliver public services. Some of the reforms that the government has introduced, including devolution to departments for responsibility for a lot of personnel management, will probably contribute to that but, given that the devolution has occurred, it is also important to have somebody that has the task of ensuring that departmental heads and senior officers administer their staff fairly and in a way that ensures that their rights are preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Merit Protection and Review Agency is a very important element of doing that. It is there to provide an external appeal body which can be available to anyone who feels unfairly treated. It was very important that the agency be established. It does not matter greatly whether it stands by itself or as part of the Public Service Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that, in the report on reform of the Public Service commissioned by the government, the proposal to combine the Merit Protection and Review Agency with the Public Service Commission was explicitly rejected and yet it has been decided to do it. Anyway, I do not think it matters greatly. The important point is that the chair of the Merit Protection and Review Agency retains her independence. That ensures that her tasks will be pursued with impartiality and a commitment to fairness and that the government will continue to fund the organisation effectively, therefore enabling it to do its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important as a guarantee, as a visible reminder to public servants, that they can appeal if they feel wronged in any way. The work of the agency, I know from the personal experience of constituents who have come to me, as I am sure the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) is also learning, is very valuable. It is very helpful to us to be able to refer them to the MPRA. It is also important that we have confidence that the MPRA does its work impartially and I have every confidence that it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to be able to support this legislation, particularly because I want to reinforce the value of what the MPRA does and also to urge public servants generally to continue this debate about how best to ensure humanity not only in the delivery of services but also in personnel management within departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to close the debate by thanking those members who have taken part in it&mdash;the member for Ryan (Mr Moore), the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth), the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a reasonably narrowly based debate but it has broadened out and it is important that I make some comment to rebut some arguments that are being given, especially by the members for Ryan and Canberra. The member for Ryan suggested that the McLeod report, which was an investigation established by me to be used for rewriting the Public Service Act, had somehow recommended against the amalgamation of the MPRA and the PSC. It did not recommend that. It had a preference for leaving those bodies apart but it did not recommend against amalgamation. But neither did the McLeod report&mdash;and this ought to be written down and remembered&mdash;have a brief on machinery of government matters. It did not have a brief to discuss whether there would or would not be amalgamations, which I call machinery of government matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was up to the government to make up its own mind on this, and it would have been anyway no matter what Mr McLeod had said. I get a little bit tired of people, having established reports and having them received by the government, then believing that somehow that report is written in stone and that the government needs to accept the findings. We sent people away to do a major exercise, the rewrite of the Public Service Act, with a major level of consultation, but governments not only reserve the right to make their own decisions in the end; they must do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are bound to make decisions about what we consider to be meritorious. We use reports that we have established to give us a guide, to give us a feel for the debate, but no more than that. However, having said that, of the 118 recommendations of the McLeod report, cabinet accepted 112 recommendations. It was a successful report in the sense that it reflected accurately the sorts of changes that needed to be made and in that the government concurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A point made by the member for Ryan was that this may be an uncomfortable situation where the MPRA, which was seen to represent the interests of individual public servants, and the Public Service Commission, which is seen to represent the interest of management, the bosses, should somehow be housed in the one organisation. He does not understand that, with the changes over the last number of years and especially with the changes ensuing from our rewrite of the Public Service Act, the responsibilities for personnel management will rest fairly and squarely with departmental secretaries. The PSC is not an arm of management. The key decisions about the conduct, hiring practices and so on of public servants will be made within the law by heads of department. That ought to be made clear so that there is not even an implied conflict between the roles of the PSC and the MPRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it seemed to me that great strengths would derive from the amalgamation. These are not large organisations&mdash;the MPRA especially&mdash;and although they have some outposts outside Canberra, it is very difficult for them to bring in any staffing power to those regional headquarters. Through the amalgamation we may have some strengthened regional presence under the new commission. I know that the amalgamating bodies are putting together their heads, and their resources, to ensure that the roles of the old PSC and the old MPRA can be delivered at regional centres outside Canberra. That is a strength that we hope will arise from the amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another consideration was to ensure that the MPRA, which had been deciding particular cases, should be well informed on personnel policy, and that the PSC should learn from those cases when it comes to the question of drawing up policy. There had to be an intimate flow of material and understanding between the two groups. I think it was happening and it ought to happen now. The quality of that interaction will be improved somewhat by the amalgamation. The discussions about cooperation between the two groups are well advanced. I recently appointed Dr Peter Shergold to head the commission. He has been in discussions with Ms Ann Forward, the director of the MPRA, and they are getting on famously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also use this opportunity to thank Mr Dennis Ives, the former commissioner, whose five-year appointment came to an end recently. He has been a sterling and outstanding public servant and has undertaken great duties as the Public Service Commissioner. I wish him well in his future role in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point was made by both the member for Ryan and the member for Canberra. The member for Canberra said that he took us on trust, and that the role of the MPRA would remain, that is, the statutory obligation for looking after the merit principle. You do not have to trust us. It is in law. We are not affecting the powers&mdash;</PARA>

What some other government might do in the future I cannot say. I always had the view that the MPRA was a very small organisation hanging out there in the wind, and I would not mind betting that the coalition would have knocked it off, had they come to power. They have less regard for those sorts of matters. Over 12 1/2 years, we have consistently had a very high regard for the importance of individual public servants having access to an independent tribunal in order that their grievances could be heard, and this has been taking place since 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters on the question of Public Service numbers, which I do not really need to address, but nevertheless they have been raised by the member for Canberra. The member for Canberra will remember that he asked me in the House, and he has written to me, about the impact on Public Service staffing as a result of the running costs program announced in the 1995-96 budget. The answer is in the budget papers, as you know, and published there&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Smyth" NAMEID="5B6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5B6">Mr Smyth</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an indicative number because we give managers the money to manage their departments, and one component of that is salary money. Depending on how they manage running costs, there will be an output on the numbers employed at the end of the year. We can provide only an indication. I think the indication will become more accurate. I am sure we will give an answer wherein we give an update on that indication. But the entire notion is that we did not set a level of numbers of public servants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, we said&mdash;as part of the drive for efficiency, not only in the public service but also in the private sector&mdash;that we would have to make considerable savings in the public sector as a result of the 1995-96 budget. So we had to tighten our belts too. But that goes to the question of running costs&mdash;not that of public servants, as such&mdash;so we can make only a reasonable prediction. As I say, the prediction we made has been published in those papers already. We would be happy to update it as we learn more. But it really is a matter for the managers of the public service to see how they can best manage that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question raised is the hoary old one of the War Memorial and the MPRA's investigation into it. I cannot say a great deal about it, because the matter is before the courts. But I will reassure you, as I have a number of newspaper journalists who keep getting it wrong&mdash;as did Crispin Hull, most recently, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times.</EMPHASIS> Firstly, quite clearly, I operated on the basis of the powers in the act when I said that the MPRA should undertake its investigations into the War Memorial. Secondly, I did so on the basis of very good evidence. It included evidence that was given to me by the MPRA, evidence that came to us from the CPSU&mdash;the union&mdash;and the view of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who was consulted on the matter on the way through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is public. It has been known. I have said it a number of times. I wish Mr Hull and others could get this one right: we were as one.

The matter is now before the courts and I cannot say any more on that. </PARA>
