<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House expresses concern over the future of Australian forest families, particularly in New South Wales, because of the uncertainty facing the forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, that uncertainty is monumental. The families of forest and timber workers are at great risk. The reason they are at risk is because of the policies of the present federal government. I say with respect to my friend the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) that with the exception of one or two enlightened people in that government they are going out of their way to destroy the forest industry and they are being aided by the Carr government in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some reference to a publication which was launched last Thursday, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Plantations: Industry Employment Environment</EMPHASIS>. I will also refer to the draft forestry reform structural adjustment package from the New South Wales government, dated 2 August 1995, issued by the Department of Land and Water Conservation and written by John Halket, the Deputy Director of Forests. I start by referring to one significant paragraph in that document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rescheduling strategy approved by Cabinet for logging in native hardwood forests provides for the 1995 quota quality sawlog supply to be sourced predominantly from regrowth forest over the next twelve months and the notification of a 30% sawlog supply reduction to be effective from July 1996. It is possible that the allocation of quota quality sawlogs to industry could be reduced by up to 50% by 1998.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest, despite that qualification of `could be'that in reality there is going to be a reduction of 50 per cent. The reality is&mdash;probably most honourable members who do not come from a forest area will not understand this&mdash;that if we are going to stop logging sawlogs now and go into regrowth, that regrowth will be cut too early, it is not going to be satisfactory, because it takes time to grow forests. It seems that some people in this government, in the Carr Labor government in New South Wales and in the fanatical Greenies do not have a clue that it takes time to grow trees. If you start harvesting regrowth forests which will not be fully grown to the point where they could be harvested for another 10 years, it will destroy the forest industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, the thrust of this motion relates to forest families, the families of timber workers. I want to make a fairly detailed statement of comments by a bloke called Bill Gilbert from the Bostabrick mill, out from Dorrigo in my electorate. The problem, as he and all the other forestry workers see it, is total uncertainty for forest families, with absolutely no resource security. I will make mention of that plantation report. You can put in all the plantations under the sun but unless there is resource security, unless there is a guarantee of harvesting those plantations, it is a wasted effort. What is likely to happen is that you put in the plantations, the trees grow and, all of a sudden, some unknown frog appears, then you have got a ban put on and you cannot go ahead and harvest them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody in their right mind is going to invest millions of dollars&mdash;and that is what it is all about&mdash;putting in new plantations which take 20 or 30 years to grow, with the upshot being that they cannot cut down a single tree because a koala has been seen in there. If we are serious about having an ongoing and continuous forest industry, we have to take action. First and foremost, we have to provide resource security and a guarantee of harvesting. That word `security' means a great deal to the men and women involved in the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn back to the Bostabrick mill. After September this year&mdash;and Friday is 1 September&mdash;the mill does not know where it will be. It does not know where it will get a single log after September. The Carr government had stated that it would guarantee quotas until 30 June next year, but this is not happening. As we have already seen from that draft document published on 2 August, they are going to source them from regrowth. The quality of the bush that they are allowed into at the moment is very poor. Mr Carr is going back on his election promises to the forest industry, just as the federal government has done. The belief not only at Bostabrick but in many other small timber milling communities right around Australia&mdash;I speak specifically of the north coast of New South Wales&mdash;is that before too long their mills will close, they will be out of jobs and their families will have nothing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these mills are in quite remote areas. The difficulty will be in finding some other form of employment for the employees. As Bill Gilbert and others have said, it means going to work every day not knowing whether they will have a job or not. The stresses and strains on the family are very significant&mdash;they are not sleeping. If we are really fair dinkum, we have to look at the possibility of paying some form of compensation for the stress this is causing to forest families. In the Gilberts's case, they have been married for 26 years and they are under great stress because of the financial problems they face with trying to make ends meet, not only now but also into the future when the jobs are gone. Bill is 51 years of age. He still has a mortgage and five children, with three still to be educated. He is the third generation that has been working in the timber industry in northern New South Wales. His grandfather was a forester in the area back in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation with the locking up of the forest is such that right now the electricity commission wants cross-arms for telephone poles that have to be made from quality tallowwood but those logs are not allowed to be harvested anymore so they cannot be supplied. Bill Gilbert said that he has never seen a greater muck-up of the forest industry as that which we have at the present time. He believes&mdash;and I think he is right&mdash;that no-one has told the side of the forest industry. Nobody has gone out and spoken for the forest industry people, the timber workers. The government is bowing to very loud, vociferous green groups.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media coverage is totally directed to the aims and the issues of the environmentalists. Education in schools is all about the preservation and conservation of the environment. Great. We need to conserve our environment; we need to look after our resources, but people have to remember that timber is a renewable resource. Timber is the most environmentally friendly resource we have. It is not like mining for iron, copper or coal; it regrows. Forestry is definitely a renewable resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to provide some facts about forestry. Australia's native forests are not&mdash;I emphasise `not'&mdash;under threat from the timber industry. Old growth forests are not&mdash;I repeat `not'&mdash;being cut down for woodchips. The facts are that Australia has 43,200,000 hectares of forest. Of that 43 million hectares, only 7.1 have been set aside to meet Australia's current and future timber needs on a sustainable basis&mdash;and I emphasise `sustainable'. Only one per cent of that area is logged annually. Right now, 65 per cent of Australia's forests have been set aside and reserved. Another 10 per cent is only limited access for firewood and things like that, which leaves 25 per cent available. Seventy-five per cent is not available and of that 25 per cent only one per cent is logged each year on a sustainable basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timber industry's efforts are directed towards maintaining continuity in the supply of sawlogs but it does not want to go out of business. It is managing the forest areas sensibly and will continue to do so. It wants to maintain continuity in the supply of sawlogs. It wants to produce the maximum of timber from each log. It wants to add value to that timber and minimise waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's make it very clear: woodchipping enables the industry to dramatically cut waste by providing an economic outlet for offcuts, material which was once burned but is now used and not wasted. The timber industry does not cut down old growth trees for woodchips, and no roundwood which could be sawn for timber becomes woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by quoting from someone I know very well, a woman called Paula Lindsay. She used to work in a sawmill at Briggsvale. Unfortunately, it burnt down and many people lost their jobs. She was in charge of 11 people at Briggsvale, which is now relocating to Tasmania&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I second the motion. Whereas my rhetoric will be a bit different and more optimistic than that of the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), I acknowledge his concern and agree with him that there is still far too much uncertainty for timber families in the timber areas in his electorate and mine in New South Wales particularly, as well as in other areas of the country. For instance, we have a member from Tasmania in the House and there is still uncertainty there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the uncertainty in New South Wales is due to the fact that we have had a change of government. The items listed under the national forest strategy and the national forest policy statement have to be rediscussed with the new New South Wales government. I can express some optimism because I have been meeting with Minister Yeadon, the New South Wales minister in charge of forests, and Minister Allan, the New South Wales minister in charge of the environment, and I now know that they sincerely want to discuss with the industry, with unions and with local communities the future of the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certainly some challenges but some of them, including some from the environment movement, are not logical. Some of the noises coming from the environment movement call for a stop to woodchipping, thinking that will stop the problems in the forest, but all the time they are targeting particular areas that are basically sawlog driven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This happened last year when the federal government was put in the position&mdash;which, I hope, never happens again&mdash;of having to consider individual coupes and deciding which could be logged and which could not. Invariably, those coupes which were most likely to be set aside from logging were mainly sawlog coupes. The coupes that were not so strongly opposed by the environment movement were more likely to be woodchip coupes. But some of the members of the environment movement will not admit this because it suits their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the environment movement has been hard-pressed for membership and funds and it has taken this strategy because it knows it can gain a lot of sympathy from the community by opposing woodchipping. But, as the member for Cowper said, woodchipping is part of an integrated logging system and we should be talking about adding value to our forests by diverting less timber towards woodchipping and more to the sawlog industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy aims to persuade people in the industry to add value. There have been some fruitful discussions and there will be even more. But there is no doubt that there is uncertainty in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some weeks ago I made an announcement about a study which I know you have had a bit to do with, Mr Speaker: the Australian National University internship program. You, the President of the Senate and members of parliament have cooperated in giving students some very useful opportunities to develop their own academic records as well as providing information to members of parliament, information that we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gerry Cirulli was assigned to me to study the effect on families of changes and uncertainty in the timber industry. He did a comprehensive survey. Even though the education department&mdash;under a previous government&mdash;refused to allow him to talk to teachers or to go into schools, he was able to establish, by talking to families and groups of people who were prepared to discuss with him the issues in the timber industry, the effect on families of the uncertainty in the timber industry. While there was not strong evidence of family breakdown among those families, there was strong evidence that people were very apprehensive and uncertain; and that uncertainty was having an effect on family life, school work and the economic viability of local communities. He quite clearly established, in what I felt was a very truthful and honest study&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Nehl" NAMEID="AE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr Nehl</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An excellent study.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HJ4">Mr SNOW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I am pleased that the opposition acknowledges the study. It was an excellent, dispassionate study which made it clear that there was still great uncertainty in our timber industry families. We are in the process of doing a couple of things. One is to ensure that we have a viable industry and the other is to ensure there is adequate compensation for people who are hurt through restructuring. That compensation has worked to some extent in that there have been people who have been able to receive social security benefits if they have been hurt. But there have also been people who have not been able to receive compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the cooperation I have had from the minister's office in trying to make sure that these people have access. I am thinking particularly of people who are contractors. An example might be a self-employed husband and wife team owning a trucker's business. They have not been able to access compensation because they have formed a company. It is quite clear that these people should be able to be compensated. If they want to relocate to another area, as some do, they should receive compensation to assist them in relocating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through government policy we are changing the picture in our forest areas. It is not going to be totally pessimistic. I believe that the fiasco of last year in the approval for woodchip export licensing will be replaced by a cooperation between state and federal departments&mdash;at least two state departments and at least three federal departments&mdash;to ensure that a scoping study is performed which provides our regions throughout Australia with assessments. That means they will know where they stand and there can be early approval of woodchip export licences, based on the current policies of state and federal governments. They will know where they stand and there will be early approval of woodchip export licensing based on the current policies of state and federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the industry has shown a cooperative attitude. It has recognised that a government which many in the industry did not want elected has been elected in New South Wales and it is prepared to cooperate with that government. It has made the sounds and approaches to government which say, `Yes, we are prepared to cooperate with you to the benefit, we hope, of our industry, taking into account the important environmental concerns.' The state government has responded. State ministers have been prepared to say to the industry, `Yes, we want a viable industry. We are prepared to work with you to get that. Let us get stuck into it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, there is uncertainty about whether or not that will happen, but at least the state governments are saying, `Yes, we're prepared to cooperate and to take into account the federal government's requirement to maintain 15 per cent of the original value that existed in our forests prior to 1788.' That is quite a legitimate request, as long as the studies enable a proper assessment of the coupes to ensure that the assessments are made on a fair basis right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another cause of the uncertainty, but it does not come from government. I refer to the industrial sabotage that has occurred throughout some of the regions of Australia. This industrial sabotage was drawn to the attention of the House when the member for Cowper and I were involved in a media conference which showed that the sabotaging of equipment has hurt families in that it has stopped people from working in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, I heard of a fencepost cutter near Shallow Crossing in Batemans Bay&mdash;he uses very few logs in his work&mdash;whose equipment was also sabotaged. That is totally illogical. If people are working in an area with the permission of the government, then they should be allowed to continue to work in that area. Our main aim, which will give certainty to families, is to make sure that we add value to our industry. The cooperation that now exists between the industry and the state and federal governments must yield us that result. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House expresses concern over the future of Australian forest families, particularly in New South Wales, because of the uncertainty facing the forest industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to express not only my concern but also my disgust at the uncertainty facing the second largest manufacturing industry in this country which employs so many people in Australia. Over 70,000 people are employed in the manufacturing industry. In my home state of Tasmania, one in seven people are employed in work associated with forest industries. In other words, over 22,000 Tasmanians are employed in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I rise to speak in this debate today is that I am so annoyed about and frustrated by the position of the federal government. Over the past 10 or 12 years, they have procrastinated, they have backed and filled, and they have done nothing about this huge industry in Australia. At the moment, we have a huge overseas debt and an import deficit because of this particular industry. Considering the fact that Australia is such a huge area with such a small population, we could be using those large areas for forest plantation areas and regrowth forest areas and exporting timber products to the world. Instead, this country imports over $1.5 billion worth of timber products. That is just incredible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has done nothing about this situation. Over the 12 years or so that the Labor Party has been in government, it has left the forest industry people, their families, their children and their grandparents to dangle at the end of a rope without doing hardly a thing about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week a statement was released which indicates that we ought to be going into plantation forests. That is part of the answer. I have always advocated that plantations have a role to play, but the frustrating thing for so many timber industry people is that over the past 12 years this government has never backed them. It has never done anything about the problem. It has always given in to the radical environmental movement. This is one of the problems in political debate in this country which could be solved if the government would just look at the scientific facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regrowth forest industry is a beautiful industry because you can replant the resource that you take away. In the process, you are helping the greenhouse effect. Young trees pump out huge amounts of oxygen and they suck in so much carbon dioxide. The old growth forests hardly do any of that; they are neutral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a great opportunity for our country, but when it comes to the forest industry the federal government always panders to what is politically important. In this country most people are very aware of the Wesley Vale pulp mill debate. It was an opportunity for downstream processing, doing away with a 50-year-old pulp mill, putting in new technology with a much cleaner output, downstream processing almost two million tonnes of woodchips out of Tasmania, putting it into pulp, and then making it into fine writing paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did this federal government do? It said, `No. We will not build that.' Why? Because the green movement in Tasmania convinced then Senator Richardson to oppose the building of that pulp mill. So today we have children in our schools being told that it is a terrible disaster that we are exporting all these woodchips. Why are we exporting woodchips? Because the federal government said that you cannot build a pulp mill to make pulp. Therefore you cannot have enough pulp in Australia to make fine writing paper. So at the end of the day we have thousands of families out there in Australia who do not know where this country is going in regard to the second largest manufacturing industry in this country. That is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the beginning of this year the national forest policy moved on. The national forest policy statement by the Federal Labor Party was actually brought out in 1992. Nothing was  done with it for two to three years. Then they moved on it, a year away from the next federal election&mdash;better try to bed down the CFMEU union in Australia. `We have to keep them on side so that we get money pouring into the coffers for the next campaign. We have to decide which coupes are to be logged and which are not.' The government came in here and said, `The state governments have not given us enough information on which coupes should be logged and which should not.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The south-east forests were investigated by the state government. New South Wales, in particular, sticks in my mind. They had a pile which was that high in documentation of scientific data on the flora and the fauna, the millipedes, the crustaceans and all the rest that lived in the forest, quite apart from the big marsupials. The federal government came in here and claimed that it had to excise 513 coupes. It came in with 14 pages for the whole of Australia justifying these coupes. That is the level of investigation, of superficiality, that this government has given to the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime you have men out there saying, `I am in this industry. I need to buy a new rig, $250,000 or $300,000. I need a new scooter, $200,000 again&mdash;half a million dollars worth of investment. Will I put the money into it or not? The federal Labor Party sits on its hands, when for 12 years it has had a great opportunity to bed down an important industry in this country, downstream process it and get our plantations going. If it had started a plantation program 12 years ago it would be halfway down the track by now with those plantations. Eucalyptus nitans or Eucalyptus globulus can be grown in this country ready for pulp milling in about 20 years. Of course, that does not solve the timber or the veneer side of it. We may be able to grow those trees and peel them in a certain way so that we can produce veneer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem for Australian families is that they do not know where they are going in the timber industry. Just talk to the people who were out here in February from Orbost, a town in Victoria totally dependent on the timber industry. They do not know what their future is. The shopkeepers do not know. The post office mistress does not know. Why? Because the government has not sat down, looked at the scientific evidence and then set about a specific program to do something about it for this country of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a national forest strategy which is going to drag on while we get our regional agreements in place. They should have been in place by now. I tell the Australian people listening to this debate that that policy was brought down in 1992. We have had one federal election since then and there will be another federal election before a TAP is done effectively for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people out there who fell trees are ordinary guys. They are the battlers of Australia. They earn good money. They work hard. It is a tough job if you have been out on the end of a chainsaw for 10 or 12 hours. They are the heart and soul of many towns in Australia. They deserve certainty and security, particularly in an industry which can be made to work for the benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor Party members come in here and say that they support the forest industry, but when it comes to voting they do not. For example, a motion was moved in this House in February which said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House, recognising the damage to regional economies and jobs, reaffirms its commitment to the national forest policy statement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the government's statement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and requests the government to bring about its immediate implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>What do we find? If we go to the record of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, we find that all the Labor members voted against it. They come in here and say, `We fight in Canberra for you people. We go there and fight for you.' But when it comes to voting they do not fight; they vote against the workers. It is really a tragedy that we are having this debate because the government could have done something about providing security and certainty for Australian forest families. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I am concerned for the jobs and I am concerned for the industry, but I am also concerned for an appropriate level of environmental protection. The hard line Greens in Tasmania refuse to recognise my balanced approach.

Why? It is because I hold Labor's most marginal seat and they are trying to hold me and the federal Labor Party to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I truly do lament the passing of the Greens as a political watchdog. They are now probably the most cynical political party in Australia. They are no longer concerned with the facts and want nothing to get in the way of their lust for power.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of forestry as an industry is incredibly complex and, naturally, highly emotive. Many of the people directly involved in the debate are incredibly polarised in their views on the forest industry either one way or the other. Not only is it difficult but it is almost impossible to bring the parties to the point of meaningful consultative achievement. Unfortunately, due to this polarity it seems constantly necessary for the federal government to arbitrate and rule on disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of us should think that there is a quick fix to the battle in our forests and none of us should lay all the blame on the other side of the debate. The fact remains that there are problems with forest practices, there are problems with chipping sawlogs and there are problems with a lack of investment in downstream processing&mdash;something I think we would all agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, on the other side of the debate there are problems with misinformation and a rolling agenda which will never be satiated while the Greens remain a cynical political entity obsessed by gaining parliamentary power. However difficult it may be, we have to resolve these problems and we have to resolve them now. Those workers and their families involved in the forest industry must be able to be certain of their future and everyone must be able to be certain of their environmental future. </PARA>

The member for Braddon (Mr Miles) pointed out that earlier this year a similar motion was moved in which we tried to reaffirm this parliament's commitment to the government's own national forest policy statement.

It is in the name of pandering to small fringe groups, such as the Greens, to maintain power in this parliament. That is what it is all about.

It maintained the Green vote by locking up this forest and that forest and absolutely procrastinating with the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) pointed out, 65 per cent of Australian forests are locked up for conservation. They are not being properly managed either. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service in New South Wales had a fire in the Werrikimbe National Park last year. Two weeks after being notified by the Forestry Commission that that fire existed, the service decided to do something about it and, in turn, lost thousands of hectares of old-growth forests&mdash;exactly what we are all about trying to protect in this place. It is just ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard one of the previous speakers&mdash;I think it was the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow)&mdash;talk about what the new Labor government in New South Wales is going to do for the forestry industry. We know what they are going to do for the forestry industry, but it will not happen, cynically, until after the next federal election. You wait and see. They will not make a move on New South Wales forests until after the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the draft forestry reform structural adjustment package, what sort of language do they use? They say things like `compensation to owner drivers of logging trucks and operators of logging equipment', `measures to assist employers affected by the immediate impact of mill closures and downsizing', `redundancy', `relocation', `training assistance' and `redeployment'. It is the talk of making a complete industry redundant, an industry that should be moving forward in this nation and doing something about that atrocious balance of payments deficit and the current account deficit that, strangely enough, in recent times the people of Australia have started to become more aware of and understand. National forest industries can make an enormous amount of difference if the government got off its backside, stopped sitting on its hands and did something about the national forest policy statement, which it implemented in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Centre for International Economics has done a study on forest industries in Australia. Some very compelling statistics have come out of that study. The government should address the problems this industry is facing. In 1994, we produced $6 billion worth of product. In the year 2000, it will be $7.3 billion. In the year 2030, it will be $10.3 billion. The trade deficit in forest products will rise from the current $1.8 billion to $5.6 billion in 2030. That is if the government just leaves things as they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just watch the Carr government in New South Wales try to close this industry down. It has the possibility of addressing our current account deficit and our balance of payments deficit. With the right opportunities, including more hardwood plantations, environmentally friendly pulp mills and other value adding, Australia's current $1.8 billion a year forest products deficit could be turned into a $413 million surplus within five years and a $6.5 billion annual surplus in the year 2030. These figures are from the Centre for International Economics; they are not our figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment in forest industries could grow from the present level of 70,000 to 211,000&mdash;all being sustainable in an industry that has a renewable resource. If a lot of the people in this place went out and spoke to the people operating in the forests and the bush in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, they would realise that the management practices that are being implemented today ensure that this is an industry that has a renewable resource. They are managing our forests on a very sensible basis and we can achieve those  sorts of figures in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) that I do go out and talk with those in the forest industry. As he knows, the forest industry is significant in my electorate. What I find interesting about today's debate is that speakers have so far tended to indicate that the restructuring of Australia's timber industry is exposing a group of people in Australia to restructuring for the very first time. Of course, that is not so. We have seen a number of industries&mdash;the steel industry, the coal industry&mdash;undergo restructuring. The timber industry is another one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If speakers opposite are honest, they will know that restructuring in the timber industry has been going on for decades. No longer is it the labour intensive industry that it once was. Mechanisation has replaced thousands of jobs in our timber industry. But it is important that the timber industry remain. I am fully supportive of that. While I may differ on the principles, I am very supportive that communities that currently support our timber industry must remain. They are an integral part of the fabric of our society. I have no doubt that they will be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the things that must happen involve not so much government policy but industry policy. It is for industry to attack this with a will to succeed. So far, I have not seen that. What I see coming from industry is pressure to be allowed to continue to develop the industry as it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully support what the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) has said. There is good management practice by those involved with state forests. I talk with our foresters. I visit the forests. I see that what they are doing is responsible. But the point cannot be lost that currently 53 per cent of our hardwood product is exported from this country as woodchips. It requires minimal jobs to get it to that state. Once it leaves our shores, it does not create a single job. My argument is this: industry has to say that 53 per cent of woodchips is too much and that we can get more value out of that product. We can do that in different ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that I have quoted these figures before. A cubic metre of sawn hardwood scantling in Australia is today valued at about $300. Simply kiln drying that product and converting it into a seasoned kiln dried product makes it automatically worth $900.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)calls upon the Australian Government to designate 11 May 1996 as Vietnam Human Rights Day in support of efforts by the Non-Violent Movement for Human Rights in Vietnam to achieve freedom and human rights for the people of Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA>The socialist government of Vietnam continues to indulge in human rights abuses against its own people. Other countries share Vietnam's appalling record on human rights; some may actually be worse. But Vietnam is singular in our region in that the government in Hanoi is aggressively courting the world to accept it back into the arena of international trade and negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fundamental right that people should be able to speak out about the government of their country without being thrown in gaol for inordinate lengths of time, often being forced into hard labour, being beaten or having their food extensively rationed so that they suffer from malnutrition. This is what is happening in the socialist republic of Vietnam. It is the height of hypocrisy for Australia to enter into trade agreements with Hanoi or to actively encourage local businesses to become associated with that country while abuses of human rights&mdash;which in Vietnam's case are numerous and of a particularly odious nature&mdash;remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I address the motion before the House directly, I would offer some brief historical background to the situation in Vietnam as it now stands. After the Vietnam war and the forced unification of the country in 1975, the government announced a policy of re-education for persona affiliated with the government and military of South Vietnam. Re-education was also applied to intellectuals, professionals and clerics in the south whose loyalty to the new order was suspect. For some, this experience consisted of a few weeks in classes of communist ideology; for tens of thousands of others it meant imprisonment in hard labour camps under conditions of extraordinary deprivation and hardship. Even today, prison camps in Vietnam are still called re-education centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Vietnam detainees were often tortured. Many were simply executed&mdash;a sort of final solution for advocates of democracy who could not be re-educated. Those imprisoned were rarely given any medical care, and thousands perished through disease and malnourishment. International human rights organisations are not convinced that these practices are still not being carried out in Vietnam today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 the Sixth Party Congress in Vietnam planted the seed of change. They adopted a policy of renovation heralding the shift to a market economy. The promise of greater political freedom was also made and enshrined in the new 1992 constitution, and laws on prison reform were introduced in 1993. But putting these reforms down on paper in Vietnam has had no obvious effect on the freedom of expression. It seems the Hanoi government is content to take the benefits of economic reform, without giving back anything in the way of relaxed attitudes to democratic expression and freedoms. These changes certainly increased Vietnam's economic activity measurably. However, the world has yet to see the human rights elements of these changes come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my motion notes, 11 May this year was the fifth anniversary of the drawing up of a manifesto by human rights activists in Vietnam. The manifesto of the Non-Violent Movement for Human Rights in Vietnam called on Hanoi to respect basic human rights and move towards a multi-party system of government. It called on the government to restore to the people the right to choose a system of government through free and open elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The author of that manifesto, an endocrinologist named Dr Nguyen Dan Que, was promptly arrested by Hanoi in 1991 and sentenced to 20 years in gaol. The publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights Watch/Asia</EMPHASIS> writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Ngyen Dan Que, an endocrinologist whose public called for political reform and respect for human rights earned him a twenty year prison sentence in 1991, was placed in solitary confinement in August (1994) and is reported to be in poor health.</PARA>
<PARA>Another Asia Watch article reports on Dr Que:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He (Que) suffers from a bleeding ulcer for which he receives no medical attention.</PARA>
<PARA>Many other prisoners in Vietnam like Tran Vong Quo are treated worse. In Quo's case, Asia Watch reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is gravely ill and has an untreated kidney disorder and has experienced severe chest pains and difficulty in breathing recently, which may be indicative of heart attack. Despite his condition, he is still required to perform heavy labour such as digging ditches and clearing trees at labour camp K1-Z30D, Ham Tan.</PARA>
<PARA>As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, a consultative delegation from this parliament visited Vietnam earlier this year during April. The report of that delegation contains a number of important recommendations and observations. In relation to Dr Que, the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One member of the delegation, Mr Sidoti, met privately . . . with Tam Van, the wife of Dr Ngyen Dan Que. She advised the delegation on Dr Que's present whereabouts and condition. Dr Que is now held at prison Z30A-KA, Xuan Loc, Dong Nai Province.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is confined to a separate cottage where he is under close guard. Ms Van and four or five other members of his family visit him once a month for approximately twenty minutes.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the visit, about three prison guards sit close by and appear to listen in on the conversation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Que suffers from high blood pressure and has stomach problems . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Vietnamese Government recently announced a series of amnesties over the next 12 months there has been no suggestion to Dr Que or his family that he will benefit from this.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an outrage. Dr Que is not a well man. His only crime was to suggest that a one-party system did not reflect the aspirations of thousands of Vietnamese who want a democratic voice in their own country. The delegation report goes on to make this important observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a general belief that the economic reform process is irreversible. Vietnam is aiming to maintain annual growth of nearly 10% and to double present GDP by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7 of the report echoes this motion today. Vietnam is looking to countries like Australia to help achieve its growth targets. Hanoi wants its neighbours to open up our economies to closer ties with Vietnam. We must make it plain that we will not do so until Hanoi demonstrates that it is willing to move towards political changes that will prevent the future persecution of its citizens for political purposes. Recommendation 7 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia should continue to use political, diplomatic and other channels to encourage improvements in the observance of human rights in Vietnam, including the implementation of international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>But, remember, Dr Que proposed non-violent protest only. Hanoi's response to calls for human rights reform to date have been muted at best. In fact, in response to calls by Amnesty International for the release of political prisoners this month, Associated Press International wrote on August 17&mdash;just one week ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vietnam will not accept American human rights demands as a condition for trade and economic relations, a Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ho The Lan also said the Vietnamese Government's prosecution of six Buddhist dissidents and nine democracy activists had nothing to do with their political views or religion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty hard to believe. It is Orwellian in the extreme the way the Vietnamese government attempts to justify incarcerating its own people on account of their political or religious views. Hanoi continues to claim these imprisonments are a result of breaches of law and have nothing to do with political motivation. Ms Lan continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . (the trials were) . . . normal trials . . . against those who have violated Vietnamese law, completely not in connection with their political views or religion.</PARA>
<PARA>A report by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Rights Watch/Asia</EMPHASIS> had a different view. Before the US Congress House Committee on International Relations subcommittee on human rights, Dinah Pokempner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there have been annual releases or amnesties of such prisoners, every year there are new trials of fresh dissidents as well. The legal system remains both institutionally weak and highly politicised, unable to provide a check to these abuses.</PARA>
<PARA>A US Department of State report on human rights of February 1995 painted the following picture of the human rights situation in Vietnam today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for internal security, employing a large border defence force and the police to monitor persons suspected of involvement in unauthorised political or religious activities . . . Vietnamese citizens do not have the rights to change their government or to assemble, associate or speak freely.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to detail that, once arrested, people are often held for indefinite periods without formal charges or without access to legal help. But two Vietnamese were arrested in late 1983 for trying to organise a democracy conference in Ho Chi Minh City. A year later they had not been charged and were still being detained. Authorities arrested Pham Van Quang in 1992 for waving the former Republic of Vietnam flag during the Ho Chi Minh marathon. In 1994 he was tried and convicted of rebellion for this heinous offence and sentenced to 15 years hard labour. There are as many as 1,000 political prisoners in Vietnam. At least four film workers were sentenced to up to 16 months re-education for being involved with the making of a film which Hanoi considered was in violation of the criminal code by spreading information against socialism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vietnam government cannot have it both ways. In wanting to open up that country to the rigours of international trade and the benefits that would flow to the Vietnamese, it must also open itself up to the scrutiny of the international community in relation to its appalling record of human rights atrocities and the benefits that will flow from that process. As a first step, Hanoi must free all political prisoners, beginning with Dr Que, with the full restoration of his civil and human rights, Hanoi must guarantee equal protection under the law to all Vietnamese, regardless of their political and religious beliefs and previous associations and Hanoi must abolish the single party system or at least be seen to move in that direction by the international community. Only through moving towards democracy can the application for admittance to the world be properly considered. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to remember that there is no league ladder of human rights abuses across the world. We should not be comparing unnecessarily different levels of humans rights abuses in one country or the other. East Timor has to be considered on its merits.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Vietnam, we have an authoritarian regime which imprisons people for their political beliefs, represses religion and conducts a variety of other human rights abuses. It does, of course, have this in common with a number of regimes across the world in its region and elsewhere and more than anything else is reminiscent of the former regimes in eastern Europe. That seems to me to be the most similar model of repression with which one can compare the current regime of Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the motion of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I do not agree with everything that is in it. For example, just as the United Nations did not conduct the elections in Czechoslovakia, Hungary or Poland, I do not see any reason why it should conduct elections in Vietnam. But I do support the notion of free, open and multi-party elections in Vietnam. I also do not support the suggestion of trade sanctions, just I would not and have not supported trade sanctions against Indonesia. In my view, that is a device that should only be used in very extreme circumstances and with a multilateral foundation rather than a unilateral foundation. </PARA>

He has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and has been gaoled for founding a non-violent political movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Doan Viet Hoat was gaoled from 1976 to 1988 and again from 1990 till now. He was formerly the Vice Rector of the Van Hanh Buddhist University in Ho Chi Minh City. He was gaoled for 15 years for founding the Freedom Forum, in which his key act was to circulate a typed letter to a number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, head of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, has been under house arrest since 1982. The Venerable Thich Quang Do, Secretary General of the Unified Buddhist Church, was gaoled just recently. Pham Van Quang, as mentioned by the honourable member for Moore, was gaoled for 15 years for waving the flag of the former Republic of Vietnam at an international marathon in 1992 in Ho Chi Minh City. Dang Phuc Tue, Deputy Leader of the Unified Buddhist Church, was recently gaoled for five years for organising flood relief unofficially for victims of floods in the Mekong delta in October 1994. A number of other people who were part of the Buddhist Church were also gaoled for three and four years for that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Catholic Archbishop Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan previously spent 13 years in gaol and was then exiled and prevented from taking up his post as a bishop Ho Chi Minh City. Other prisoners include Pham Van Thanh, Thai Thi Kim Van, the Venerable Thich Tue Sy, the Venerable Thich Tri Sieu, Father Nguyen Chau Dat, Do Van Thac and Do Van Hung. They are just some of the political prisoners and religious prisoners currently held in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence also indicates that political prisoners are commonly mixed with ordinary criminal prisoners for reasons that we can only speculate upon. It is also clear that the government on occasions engages in classic tactics designed to mislead visiting delegations. So when the United Nations delegation visited the prison camp at Phu Yen in 1984 there were only four prisoners in the camp, the rest of them were allegedly out engaging in flood fighting activities. It just so happened that the four who remained thought that the administration of the prison was excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harassment of churches and religious activities is widespread, ironically, given that one of the main victims, the Unified Buddhist Church, was also very prominent in demonstrations and dissidence against the former Diem government in the early 1960s in Vietnam. We remember very well the self-immolations that occurred in that time as a form of protest against that government. Such things have occurred recently, including on 24 May last year when a Buddhist monk self-immolated and there was a following demonstration in which a number of people ended up receiving prison sentences for three to four years just for participating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prison conditions are generally poor and abusive treatment is not uncommon. The Human Rights Watch organisation last year described the provision of food and medicine for prisoners as `grossly inadequate'. As was outlined by the honourable member for Moore, both Dr Nguyen Dan Que and Professor Doan Viet Hoat have serious health problems. There are good reasons to believe that the level of treatment and medicine they are receiving for these problems is grossly inadequate. Convictions that have formed the basis of this imprisonment under the Vietnamese penal code are for crimes such as `violation of national security' and `anti-socialist propaganda'. Sometimes those trials last little longer than a few hours with minimal or inadequate representation of the defendant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that there is not a great deal of evidence that there is any form of substantial organised violent attempt to overthrow the ruling regime. However, perhaps at some variance with the honourable member for Moore, I think there are some positive signs of change in Vietnam. Last year Amnesty and also Human Rights Watch noted that there had been a relaxation of restrictions on freedom to worship. In 1992, Amnesty noted that there had been a release of over 100 former officials of the former Republic of Vietnam. Subsequently, in 1993, a number of religious prisoners were released. Economic liberalisation has been accompanied by some relaxation in censorship with a significant increase in open debate permitted on issues like corruption and mismanagement and by some degree of freedom of discussion in academic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are signs that it is easier to get an exit visa. The dissident writer Dinh Thu Huong was recently allowed to go to Europe for a conference for the first time. There are also pleasing signs with respect to labour rights. Strikes are legal in the private sector and do happen. There is at least some semblance of genuine labour management bargaining, although unions are still predominantly government controlled. The genuine union activity that does occur appears to be essentially on a localised basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amnesty has reported that there were no executions in Vietnam in 1994, although eight people were sentenced to death&mdash;from memory, for ordinary crimes, although I cannot be certain of that. Significantly, in 1995 the United States State Department in a report on the state of human rights in Vietnam stated there are `no credible reports of torture of detainees' and `no reports of political killings', which, given the source, indicates that things are perhaps not as bad as they might be elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With economic change we will continue to see, in my view, these improvements occur. I was very pleased to see that the government raised these issues recently in strong terms with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Closer ties and more aid will assist Australia in influencing better human rights performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I call on the government to ensure that human rights is always at the centre of our relations with Vietnam. Regardless of whether it is better or worse than any other country, we have to treat these issues on their merits. There is evidence of serious infringement of human rights in Vietnam. We have to look at those issues on their merits and put forward a very strong position on behalf of the Australian people that these sorts of things are unacceptable and that imprisonment of religious and political leaders is unacceptable in our region. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the member for Moore (Mr Filing) for bringing this motion for discussion before the House today. I know that he is one member in this place who has consistently exhibited a genuine concern for these sorts of issues. My involvement with Vietnam goes back a considerable time. I last visited there in about mid-1993. I am hoping to return on another private visit later this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that my visits have been private visits&mdash;although I have had some official contact with the government there&mdash;I think overcomes the potential problem that the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) made reference to: the possibility that one may be less likely, when going on an official delegation from this parliament, of which there has been one, to get to see what is really going on there. I was fortunate because of the friends and contacts that I had there to be able to have a good look at what was going on as far as human rights abuses in Vietnam were concerned. Vietnam now has over 70 million people. I particularly noticed when I was there last that it was, and I am sure still is, very much an ordered society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly interested in having a look at what was happening in the churches there. There is an official and an unofficial church very much in evidence. As has already been mentioned, in practice freedom of religious worship is restricted and controlled. On a Sunday that my wife and I were there we attended a Protestant church which was essentially part of the official church. This was in Ho Chi Minh City. I was informed afterwards by an American with whom I was able to converse privately outside the church that there would have been a state representative present at that service who would have observed who was there and what was said. The fact that we were there would have been duly noted, as I am sure most of our movements in the country were throughout the week we were in Ho Chi Minh City and in Hanoi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a discussion earlier this morning with a friend of mine who is a pastor and has just returned from Vietnam. He has had some dealings with the Full Gospel Church of Vietnam. It operates with permission but with severe restrictions and ongoing persecution. There is still a number of Christian pastors from that denomination and a number of others who are in prison in Vietnam. When I was there I gave the government representative with whom I met a list of names of Christians who were imprisoned. I subsequently found that some of them, though not all, had been released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vietnamese communists have a historical antipathy towards religion in general, and particularly to the Catholics and Buddhists. Reference has been made to the Amnesty International 1995 report which showed that there are at least 60 prisoners of conscience currently in Vietnam, and seven of those are Roman Catholic priests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the mid-1980s Vietnam has embarked on a process of what is called their doi moi. This is a process of economic liberalisation and market reforms. It has come about for a very practical and pragmatic reason: the country has realised that its very, very low standard of living will only be improved by opening up to international trade. Vietnam has a desperate need for foreign capital and it is going full steam to attract foreign capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been a major beneficiary in many respects of that push. When I was in Vietnam in 1993 Australia's BHP was the biggest foreign investor in the country. Of course, at that particular time there were still very real restrictions on American investment in Vietnam. Those restrictions have since been liberalised and I have no doubt that the Americans have probably overtaken Australia as one of the most substantial investors in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vietnam is also a beneficiary of Australian aid. The honourable member for Melbourne alluded to the fact that there needs to be a connection between Australia's aid program and human rights. In my view, it is quite unrealistic to do otherwise. Australia's aid program to Vietnam, introduced in 1992 on a four-year cycle, involved $100 million. That is a lot of money. Because we are so generous, and in many respects rightfully so, to some of our neighbours&mdash;particularly to Vietnam because, I suspect, of the history that we have there&mdash;we ought not to make aid entirely untied. We ought to make it contingent in some way on Vietnam accepting responsibility for improving human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republic of Vietnam is a one-party state, controlled completely by the Vietnamese Communist Party. Having seen it first hand, it is, in my estimation, a completely totalitarian state in almost every sense of the word. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press in practice are severely limited. I say `in practice' because in a lot of these things they make the right sounds and they write down the right words about these freedoms, but in practice those things are severely restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certainly very severe limits on public criticism of the regime. As we have already heard, the right to assembly is restricted both in law and practice. Ultimately, we ought to be under no illusions about Vietnam because it is in no sense a democracy. Vietnam has gone only a few tentative steps towards what must be an ultimate goal&mdash;at least from our perspective&mdash;of seeing the country become a democracy. Women face deeply ingrained social discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, Vietnam trades extensively with Australia. From 1987 to 1993 our exports increased at the rate of 50 per cent per annum. In 1993 our exports to Vietnam totalled $114 million. We imported goods worth $251 million from Vietnam. We have quite a noticeable trade imbalance with Vietnam but, as we have trading imbalances with almost all our partners, perhaps it is not worthy of particular mention. Most of the imports from Vietnam involved crude petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this debate let me observe, perhaps on a little wider basis, that our foreign relations with countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia and China are conducted on a remarkably pragmatic level. Obviously there is no point in cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. But&mdash;and it is a big but&mdash;East Timor has been mentioned in this debate and I think those of us predominantly taking part in this debate are members who have consistently taken up the cause of East Timor. It has not been particularly politically correct to do so and it has not got us anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who will be speaking after me in this debate on the other side of the House, is the chairman of that Friends of East Timor group. As has already been alluded to in this debate, I just want to say that obviously our relations with Indonesia are on the same level in many respects as they are with Vietnam in that we seem to somehow accept the status quo, and this motion is about changing it. I do not know in the end what will happen to the East Timorese people, but I hope that something sooner or later does happen to give them what I believe is their right to self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our relations with Vietnam, however they go, and there is every indication that they will continue to improve as a country of that size and with a standard of living as low as it has, represents for us a potentially substantial trading partner. However, let us not forget the oppression&mdash;and there is no other word for it&mdash;that our Vietnamese friends live under. Let us ensure that action is taken to improve this situation whenever and however we can. I once again commend the member for Moore for raising this issue in the House. It is an important matter and I support strongly his motion and commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Likewise, I congratulate the member for Moore (Mr Filing) for moving the motion and broadly support its wording. On 8 July the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine, a fairly free market publication, gave indications of economic advance in Vietnam&mdash;eight to 10 per cent growth each year; inflation reduced from around 300 per cent to 10 to 20 per cent; and the situation of increasing women's participation in the work force, up to 47 per cent. It indicated that it was the third largest exporter of rice, there had been an end to black market trading in hard currency, and the dong, the local currency, had a degree of stability with the US dollar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the point the previous speaker made about Australia once having been a major investor in Vietnam, the reality is that the growth of foreign investment in Vietnam is such that Australia is a minor player these days&mdash;in fact, $2,600 million of overseas investment in 1993, with both Hong Kong and Taiwan over $400 million individually. So the results of the 1986 doi moi renovation process are certainly being seen on the economic front. The country also has a degree of advantage with its educational system and the fact that there is a significant number of the population fluent in a number of languages. So, on the economic front, there has been some improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to political reform, whilst the state department annual report of various countries last year did indicate that there was no evidence of torture and no reports in regard to judicial murders&mdash;and one important reform in regard to trade union rights was that there had actually been a very significant improvement in the rights of workers&mdash;on a broad front Vietnam still leaves a lot to be desired. It is very timely because my colleague the member for Fowler (Mr Grace), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and I yesterday were present at the opening of the Tien Hau temple in Canley Vale in western Sydney for Sydney's Indochinese population. Whilst the degree of support for the Koumintong political line at that event might not represent all of the population, I think their emphasis upon the need for human rights reform in Vietnam was of importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the matters raised in this motion is the question of a one party political state. There is no doubt that there is a situation where no-one can essentially set up parallel competing party organisations. Ninety-two per cent of the National Assembly are members of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the other eight per cent got there because they were fairly compliant or else they were of national importance. So, essentially, it is important that that political system be opened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been claimed quite rightly that political prisoners are shoved in gaol with people who are in there for far different offences, that food and medical conditions within leave a lot to be desired and that quite obviously there is no or minimal international access to prisoners. Of quite serious concern is the failure of this system to allow proper review and proper access to political trials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though the situation in Vietnam has not gained international attention. Amnesty International, a very reputable organisation, concluded in its 1994 report that there were at least 60 prisoners of conscience. It reported that, in late 1994, the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam again came under increased internal pressure for its refusal to become part of the state sponsored Buddhist federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Buddhists have been a force for national identity. During the Diem, the pro-Vietnamese governments persistently said that Vietnam had a national identity and stood by national determination. The Buddhists are saying in 1994 and 1995 that they do not wish to have their religious freedom suppressed. They do not wish to be forced into a state sponsored organisation. We in Australia should stand up for those rights. Since 1982, a total of 13 years, their supreme patriarch, Thich Huyen Quang, has been virtually under house arrest. They have a situation where they cannot freely carry out their religious observances. They have been forced to the point where there has been self-immolation as well as a large number of arrests and incarcerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in Vietnam has been such that it has attracted international attention. Amongst the activities that tried to press the Vietnamese government towards an improvement was the pressure exerted by the UN working group on arbitrary detention in October 1994. In May of that year, Amnesty International issued a special report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Socialist Republic of Vietnam: Buddhist monks in detention</EMPHASIS> expressing concern about the situation there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November last year Amnesty International, again, wrote to the Vietnamese government seeking information. From February they had sought permission for a delegation to look at questions of the national security legislation, the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, the fairness of trials and&mdash;this, unfortunately, applies to a large number of other countries&mdash;the continued use of the death penalty. By September there was no response and Amnesty International again reiterated its request to the government of Vietnam to allow access and to open the country, in a very real sense, to international scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A 1994 United States Department of State report on human rights practices to the US Congress again reiterated the problem in Vietnam. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government was responsible for continued human rights violations in 1994. Vietnamese citizens did not have the right to change their government or to assemble, associate, or speak freely. The Government continued to prohibit establishment of an independent press and independent organizations. It also maintained its longstanding policy of not tolerating dissent.</PARA>

<PARA>There is some significant debate and conjecture about the number of people in detention, because we cannot totally rely on those people who have an axe to grind against the current regime. But the US state department itself supplied figures that are of concern. It stated in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reliable information on the total number of political prisoners in Vietnam. Anti-SRV exile groups have claimed there are as many as 1,000 political prisoners in the country; other reliable sources put the figure closer to 200. The secrecy surrounding the Vietnamese judicial and prison systems makes it difficult for outside observers to make an accurate estimate.</PARA>
<PARA>There are large numbers of people being detained because they seek to widen the political process, to put forward views that are found to be in contravention of very tight restrictions and to express their religious views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia has raised this matter internationally. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) has indicated that he has taken the opportunity of having contact with Vietnam to press home to them these matters. I, for one, associate myself with the previous speaker's view that Australia should, as far as possible, attempt to attach Australia's aid payments to good governance towards the liberalisation of political process and to fewer human rights violations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that article 4 of the 1992 constitution is also of concern because it certainly drives home the reality of the need for a very significant opening of Vietnam's political processes. It says, `The Communist Party of Vietnam, guided by Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh's thought, is the only force leading the State and society.' As I say, we do have a large way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to refer to Mr Greg Sheridan, who was cited by the last speaker on this side, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). This particular individual is a constant apologist for the Indonesian government and other suppressing regimes in this region. He is the same person who believes that Australia should take every refugee claimant that gets off a boat here and, as soon as they say that Australia is a better country than where they come from, they should be accepted as refugees. Our support for this motion today indicates that there should be some consistency. I again emphasise my support for this motion. </PARA>

If there is any way that I can help to displace the member for Bruce at the next election, I will do so. </PARA>

<PARA>Adult Learners Week will be celebrated for the first time across Australia from 10 to 16 September. The aim of the week is to increase community awareness of the range and quality of easily accessible adult learning programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adult education is the most popular, as well as the most misunderstood, form of education in Australia. It is usually underfunded and underresourced and, as such, is vulnerable to any funding cuts. Proof of its status can be found in the titles of publications associated with adult education, such as Mike Newman's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Poor Cousin</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS>, a report of the Senate committee inquiry into adult education in Australia in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Cinderella has been knocking on the door for long enough. To 1995, around nine million Australian adults have participated in adult education at some time in their lives, undertaking further education or training after and outside formal education. Each year, around three million adults participate in some form of further education or training. Of all the courses that people participate in, more than half are provided by employers. Some 20 per cent of all courses are in computing and business administration, and 13 per cent are in the area of health, fitness and caring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of those professions which have introduced mandatory continuing education, adult education and training is a voluntary activity. However, changes in the economy and in work organisation have created growing pressures and incentives for all work force members to continually develop their knowledge and skills and to have their knowledge and skills formally recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more of us are becoming lifelong learners, and this trend will continue. Gone are the days when we left school, did an apprenticeship or university course and settled into an occupation for life. Changing technologies mean that throughout our lives we will have many career changes, often necessitating learning new skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adult education has always responded in some way to the learning needs of working men and women. Thus a very important part of the history of adult education is to be found in the development of the mechanics institutes, the schools of arts and the Workers Educational Association, with which I worked before I entered this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that there has always been tension between adult education for vocational purposes and adult education for its own sake&mdash;for personal enlightenment and deeper understanding of the world around us. In the past, there have been distinctions between technical or vocational education and general or, as it was called, `liberal' education. The former has been referred to as `training' and characterised as inferior to `education'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some ways, these tensions have been accentuated by the national training reform agenda, which has given such a powerful impetus to skills formation for the Australian work force. The Australian National Training Authority negotiates with the states and territories over the allocation of some $3.6 billion for vocational education and training. However, there is now a growing appreciation in some quarters that the distinctions between vocational and non-vocational education&mdash;or between training and education&mdash;are of limited usefulness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within adult education itself, it has long been recognised that whether a course is vocational depends on the learner's motives. A computer course may be recreational for somebody who wants to play computer games or surf the Internet. A flower arranging course may be vocational for someone interested in working at a florist. In foreign language classes it is typical to find a similar mix of motives. Keeping this in mind, there is a good deal of evidence to show that adult education is making a significant contribution to the national skills formation effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, much energy has been wasted on debating what adult education really is. From a personal point of view, and as chair of my local adult education group, I accept the reality of vocational courses. Indeed, as direct government grants have been decreased, it has only been by running vocational type courses that groups such as the Kiama Adult Education Association have been able to survive. Yet, having said that, it would be to my mind a great loss if we did not continue courses referred to in the old jargon as `liberal' adult education&mdash;that is, learning for the sake of learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, there is also a role for courses enabling adults to come to terms with our modern, changing society. In the main, children today are better educated than their parents. The Scandinavian countries have recognised this and use the term `catch-up education' in reference to parents wanting to catch up with their children's education&mdash;I guess if for no other reason than to help them with their homework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some societies, there is a suggestion that everyone, regardless of age or educational background, should have the opportunity to gain an education which can be taken at whatever stage of life the person wishes to take it. Unfortunately, given that the economic rationalists have been let loose in the education sector, as they have in so many other sectors, such ideas have been abandoned before their time has come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, adults have gathered together in order to change their lives. In the 19th century in Australia, people gathered together in schools of arts and mechanics institutes to learn to read and write and to learn the new mechanical arts in order to change their communities and to gain a greater understanding of the world and how they might influence it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Workers Educational Association was founded in most states of Australia in the second decade of this century so that working people&mdash;often from trade unions&mdash;could learn together and gain more control over their lives. I have always felt it was a pity that the WEA was adopted full scale from Great Britain and was never adapted to Australian conditions and standards. But I acknowledge the tremendous contribution that the WEA has made to adult education in Australia. The changes were a bit late in coming, but they were made in the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also recognise, especially this year, the role that the Australian Army Education Service has played in respect of adult education. I was delighted to play a very small part in obtaining some funding to assist in the publication of the book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A sweet use of adversity: the Australian Army Education Service in World War II and its impact on Australian adult education</EMPHASIS>. There can be absolutely no doubt as to the tremendous impact that the Australian Army Education Service had on adult education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Frederico Mayor, the Director-General of UNESCO, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lifelong learning is a basic human right and a universal human value; learning and education are ends in themselves, to be aimed at by both individuals and societies and to be promoted and made available throughout the entire lifetime of each individual. This recognises the essential role of learning throughout our lives, in our workplaces, our homes, our communities and in our retirement. We are all lifelong learners!</PARA>
<PARA>Mike Newman, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defining the enemy: adult education in social action 1994</EMPHASIS>, draws on Gelpi, who has been head of the lifelong education unit at UNESCO for 20 years, in describing adult education. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He sees lifelong education as "education for all and by all". He sees it as involving new and dynamic relationships between political systems, work and production, and social and cultural movements. He sees it as bringing together traditional and modern, formal and non-formal, institutional and self-directed forms of education and learning. He sees it as a potential means of redressing individual inequities, doing away with unfair divisions of labour, transforming whole nations, and putting to right the unequal relations between rich and poor countries. The idea of lifelong learning has become increasingly important in a rapidly changing world. Although the concept has always been the essence of the philosophy of the adult and community education sector. Adult community education is an activity orientated towards lifelong learning that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">provides opportunities for people (of all ages, regardless of employment status or previous education) or enhances their vocational, personal, cultural or social development.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that in Adult Learners Week we are aware of the valuable contribution that adult education providers are making in order to enrich our society. Many activities have been conducted throughout Australia. Those people who work in the field of adult education do so with a dedication that is hard to imagine exists in any other field. I am proud that through much of my adult working life I have been associated with adult education, and I continue to be associated with it as Chairman of the Kiama Adult Education Association. </PARA>

I congratulate all concerned with Adult Learners Week 1995 for the initiative that it will bring into the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to my election to parliament, I had spent my life in education from the time I started school at the age of five. One of the areas of education in which I was personally involved as an educator was adult education. I can say to the member for Throsby, in commenting on his final remarks, that one of the reasons adult education is pleasurable for all concerned is that it has a totally motivated clientele. Having been a high school teacher&mdash;where the level of motivation amongst students can be mixed&mdash;it is certainly very welcome for an educator to be dealing with people who are in a learning situation because that is where they want to be and they are focused on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad goals of Adult Learners Week are to increase the profile and recognition of adult learning, to increase participation in adult learning, to enhance networks amongst all involved in adult learning and to promote national objectives for education and training. The three national themes that have been selected to provide a focus are creating opportunities for involvement in the areas of lifelong learning, women's ways of learning and leading, and access to learning for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that those who chose those themes must have had a very difficult task. It is always very difficult to reduce broad educational areas to narrower areas and to decide which of those areas need to be concentrated on. However, as the years go by and as the Adult Learners Week initiative is pursued&mdash;as I am sure it will be&mdash;there will be the opportunity to pursue other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the risk of being typecast, I intend to make some comment on the subject of women's ways of learning and access to education. Some years ago I chaired a subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which looked at the subject of returning long-term unemployed people to the work force. We very quickly identified that the basic client group was women. That inquiry was conducted in 1987. The levels of long-term unemployment amongst men, particularly young males, has increased since that time. Nevertheless, overwhelmingly we were addressing women at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very early the inquiry clearly identified that the area of education on which one needed to focus in order to get long-term unemployed people into training and back into the work force was adult education. This was for a number of reasons that are quite central to adult education. Its programs are usually short and do not have any academic prerequisites. They are designed as bridges, in many cases, to further courses of education and skilling. They can, in themselves, provide the opportunity to learn discrete areas of skill. These are characteristics of education and training relevant to people who are experiencing long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who have been unemployed long term tend to be undereducated in the first place&mdash;undereducated in terms of the demands for education and skill that presently apply in the work force. They may be undereducated by virtue of having left formal education prematurely or they may be&mdash;as in the case of women in our society, particularly older women&mdash;women who have been out of the work for a very long time. Whatever appropriate skills or education they previously had are no longer in demand or else are so rusty as to be considered not viable for employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not want it thought that, because I am talking in terms of employment, that is all adult education is about. However, when one deals with people who have been long-term unemployed&mdash;whether voluntarily or involuntarily&mdash;you very quickly identify that the matter of self-esteem is central to the ability of these people to adjust their skills, attitudes or whatever is necessary to get them back into mainstream society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that employment by somebody else is an objective value of your worth, or it is seen in that way by most people. The matter of collecting a pay packet is a way of seeing that you are of value to someone else. Or, if you are self-employed, the matter of making a profit, and therefore having the equivalent of a pay packet, is proof that what you do is something that is of value to other people. That is the easy benchmark and, I think, the easiest&mdash;in some senses it is the most relevant&mdash;way to talk about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, when you talk about women who have been out of employment for a long time, particularly because they have had family responsibilities, you are dealing with people who, in most cases, have some difficulty with that concept because they have not been in what they see as an objective situation of remuneration. No matter how supportive a woman's family, her husband and her children are towards her role as a mother and wife, the personal nature of their attitudes may nevertheless leave her with the niggling doubt that she does not have any real, objective worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The step out of the home is often one that involves a major psychological hurdle for a lot of women returning to the work force. Adult education bridging courses&mdash;the so-called short courses&mdash;have long since proven to be extremely important to such people. A number of them have been devised over the years and were starting at about the time of the inquiry of that House of Representatives committee I just referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That committee identified that the establishment of those formal bridging courses which were easy for the client group&mdash;in this case, women&mdash;to enter, which were non-threatening and apparently non-demanding, was important in easing someone into the learning situation. It is a matter of record that many women who started out on such courses as `New Opportunities for Women', which might appear to some people to be fairly low level courses, nevertheless have shown that they are capable of going on to very high levels of education indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is a little bit misleading to talk about higher education as though that is the area of true worth. As an educator in many different areas, including the tertiary area, I am aware that all levels of education and learning are of equal value. Because each level addresses a specific client group, success is measured with respect to that particular client group. Success at the adult education level is therefore every bit as worthy as is success at the highest possible educational level&mdash;let us say, supervision of someone doing a doctorate in philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make is that it is important that society focus for a period of time&mdash;in this case, through Adult Learners Week&mdash;on the very real social, economic and educational relevance of adult education. Of course, in this day and age we receive a lot of education daily and informally through the television set. Things that once upon a time one had to read learned books about are daily and nightly presented to us in a very learned way on the television screen. Valuable as that medium is as a general educator of society&mdash;and maybe even as a specific part of a formal learning course&mdash;there is no substitute for the interaction of teacher with student in the first place, and of student with student in the second place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adult education, because of its ease of access and its apparently simple and limited objectives at point of contact and entry, provides that necessary encouragement to gaining education as well as the basis for gaining the confidence to go on to achieve further skills and higher levels of education, or maybe to just try out the skills one already has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of record that many people have become successfully self-employed&mdash;producing goods and services through their own initiative, intelligence and imagination for our society&mdash;after having undertaken a very basic adult education course which may have been considered non-vocational, just one that was designed only for personal growth. My time has expired. As I said at the beginning, I am grateful to the member for Throsby for putting this item on the agenda and raising it to a level of public prominence. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I am pleased to be taking part in Adult Learners Week, which is being held between 10 and 16 September this year, and I was honoured to be asked to be one of its patrons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Learning is not just something people do at school; learning begins at school and continues for the rest of one's life. In some cases, like mine, learning really starts after leaving school. In my case, I was unable to participate fully in school programs because of literacy difficulties. After becoming involved in the union movement, I found it necessary to read and write&mdash;what would be called&mdash;properly, and I sought to find ways to learn. Learning to read and write was much more difficult for adults in those days, as they were assumed to have acquired those skills, and one really had to seek assistance throughout the education system and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowadays it is becoming much more acceptable to seek additional learning and training. The stigma of not having learnt at the right time is fading. In fact, Working Nation, the program geared to include additional training in all its employment schemes, is there and working very well. So, although there have been massive changes in the working structure of Australia, the government is in a greater part trying&mdash;and in a greater part succeeding&mdash;to take Australians through the changes for them to come out prepared for our next century and the challenges that lie there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Throsby quoted the words of the Director-General of UNESCO, Dr Frederico Mayor, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lifelong learning is a basic human right and a universal human value: learning and education are ends in themselves, to be aimed at both individuals and societies and to be promoted and made available throughout the entire lifetime of each individual.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very good quote; it says that learning in itself basically is worth while. I think that is a pretty good aim to have, and it is something worth saying. It is a great aim for all adult learners and a great aim for Adult Learners Week. It is a chance to give the basic right a good boost, and to make sure that learning is part of the agenda for all decision makers. It is essential in all aspects of our life, whether it be in the workplace, our communities, our homes or retirement&mdash;when we think about the third age universities and now open learning, which is part of the Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Learning will help us rebuild lives that have been damaged. It will help people with disabilities become part of our communities. Those from overseas can find ways of overcoming barriers to learning. Learning is also fun. Whatever areas we choose to develop our skills in, there are others who are also keen to develop skills in those areas. It is a way to make new friends and to set oneself challenges in friendly competition. Learning does not have to be `because you have to do it'; learning can be what you want to do, and that is stimulating and entertaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of Adult Learners Week is a celebration and also a campaign. It is celebrating the contribution made by adult and community education to the empowerment of people, to the economic and cultural development of Australia and to social change. It is a campaign to broaden the awareness of the diversity of adult learning and to encourage more adults to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can readily say that I participated in adult learning and it changed my life; it will do the same for others who are prepared to throw away their inhibitions and have a go. Taking the first step is always frightening, but it is like the first swim: once you're in, you have a great time and you can't think why you haven't done it before. I congratulate the organisers and look forward to the tremendous week in September that is being planned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the motion of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) today to recognise Adult Learners Week, and I commend adult learners around Australia. We know that education does not necessarily end when one leaves school. I came to this place with the desire to have further development in education. I studied until year 10 but, because money was short, I was not able to go on to further studies&mdash;that was 30 or 40 years ago. So it is with pleasure that I discuss this issue today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People can, and do, continue to participate in some form of education throughout their working lives and into retirement. In fact, further education is often an enjoyable pastime during retirement. As Francis Bacon once said, `Studies serve for delight.' It is estimated that there are around three million adult learners in Australia participating in some form of education or training and that about 78 per cent of all Australians aged 21 and over are participating in further education. It is most interesting to note that about half of the courses they are participating in are provided by employers. So on this day we must recognise the essential role that employers in our free enterprise system play in the training and learning process. Employers recognise the importance of having their work force up to date and fully trained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individuals also recognise the importance of further training. The workplace is extremely competitive today and education and training qualifications provide a distinct advantage. For those looking for a definition of `adult learning', there are several main categories: formal education within our universities and colleges; private-provider education through business colleges and so forth; community provided education through non-profit organisations such as third age universities; education through unions and the professional associations; education through government agencies; and, finally, the everyday education of ourselves in our contact through the community, through the workplace and through careful winnowing of the media. That is the enormous diversity of adult education available in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is increasingly recognised that at least 10 per cent of Australian adults have significant literacy and numeracy problems. Technological change demands that as many as possible become more computer literate. This is Australia's first Adult Learners Week, which seeks to promote all the positive aspects of adult learning that I have mentioned. The promoters of Adult Learners Week feel that, despite the vast number of people participating in adult learning, not a lot is known about it in Australia&mdash;a fact which is confirmed by my own experience in my electorate. Over the last couple of years a small band in Port Pirie has been particularly keen to promote adult learning, and I have been pleased to be able to support them. I have shared an hour or two with them in recent months, just watching, and have enjoyed their keen participation. I understand that guidance and advisory services for adults wanting to return to some form of education or training are inadequate. I hope that Adult Learners Week can start to redress some of these inadequacies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend those adults who are participating in further education and are continually renewing their skills and finding new ones. I know there a number of mature age students and third age university students in my electorate who enjoy their studies immensely. To those who are participating in Adult Learners Week from 10 to 16 September, I wish you all the best in many years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I will be brief. I want to thank all those who have participated in this debate today. As all speakers have said, it is an important debate which deals with a sector of the Australian education system that in many respects has been overlooked. I referred in my comments to Mike Newman's description of it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Poor Cousin</EMPHASIS> or in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sometimes think of adult education as a sleeping beauty waiting for the prince to come along. The prince may come along with the funding, but I think the time has passed for that because the economic rationalists have taken hold of the education system, like so many other areas, and now there is an emphasis on vocational training. Important as vocational training is&mdash;I always support vocational training&mdash;we must not get too carried away. There is the worth of education for education's sake. There is the worth of education to make us better participants in the community in which we live. The United States refers to this as civics. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said recently that money has been made available to teach civics, the political system&mdash;not in a partisan political way, but the general concept of politics in our schools. I support that very much. It would not go astray to have a more general view of that out there in the community as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that always surprises us as members of parliament is the&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;ignorance that many people have of the political system, which comes out in things that they talk to us about when they see us at social functions and various other things. It is a great pity that people are not more aware of just how the political system in Australia, with all its strengths and weakness, works. That is a very important role that adult education can play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly attracted to the comments of the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) in which he said that adult learning can be fun. It can be fun. The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) made the point that those who participate in adult education are doing it because they want to participate. That is so important. Although schools are much better than when I went to school, there was often a reluctance by some people to learn and you had to force them to learn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adult education is an activity that people participate in of their own free will. They are there because they want to learn, whether it is because of a vocational interest or a general interest. They are motivated and, therefore, the exercise of education is much more enjoyable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the aftermath of the 15 July poor showing by the Queensland Goss government and its particular disregard for the people of the metropolitan south-east in respect of the proposed tollway, we find three members opposite starting to panic about the federal implications. Last weekend we read of their opposition to the Goss proposals. Of course, their pleas are not on behalf of the many thousands of affected Queenslanders but on the optimum strategy for their electoral survival whenever we go to the polls federally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether Premier Goss eventually changes his mind is problematic, particularly where the ALP vote is at risk. That is in marked contrast to his and state energy minister Tony McGrady's arrogant and dismissive attitude on the Eastlink project, which is planned to join the Queensland and New South Wales electricity grids through the Lockyer Valley in my electorate and the southern part of the Darling Downs in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). While the federal coalition supports a national electricity grid, that support is conditional on appropriate environmental, health, economic and social impact studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, we have supported an Eastlink Senate inquiry, approved in the other place a few months ago. Mr McGrady's reactions have been to press ahead willy-nilly and without any thought for people, most of whom he knows do not vote for his side of the political fence. I say to the Premier and Mr McGrady that the anti-Eastlink lobby is strong and effective. Just as it did in the Labor state marginal seats in Brisbane on 15 July, so it will do in the federal Queensland marginals in the coming months unless they listen to people at the grassroots. </PARA>

Bob Carr's move is designed to turn Manly's Reef Beach into a nudist beach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the opposition front bench are celebrating the fact that they have a self-confessed liar in their midst. When asked about the fact that the member for O'Connor had publicly admitted to lying, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh, that. Well, that did occur a very long time ago and it hasn't occurred while he's been a member of my front bench.</PARA>
<PARA>`Oh, that'! The journalist had the temerity to go on and say, `Oh, there's a statute of limitations here, is there?' The reply was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, there's not a statute of limitations but I think quite a lot of water has flowed under the bridge . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Not the Hindmarsh Bridge, of course, but under the bridge. So the point that the news services made of it was that here he is, with this unctuous hypocrisy about the supreme truth, that truth is absolute, saying that the Prime Minister should not have on the front bench someone who he asserts is a liar. But when he has pointed out to him that he has an acknowledged liar, he says, `Oh, that.' There is no move to take him off the front bench. Let me go to a couple of recent instances about the Leader of the Opposition's penchant for the truth and his obsessive interest in absolute truth. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> on 25 August he was asked this by Fran Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And what about Carmen Lawrence and John Howard though? Did you have any hand in urging Richard Court to do this?</PARA>
<PARA>There's the question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did you have any hand in urging Richard Court to do this?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I have said to you that the initiative for establishing a Royal Commission came from Court. I've said that to you and there's a very good history for it. But . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And you thought it was a good idea?</PARA>
<PARA>Howard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . look. . . the Royal Commission has been established. It was his initiative to establish the Royal Commission, absolutely his initiative, and that was his decision. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, on 18 April, before it was clear we were going to have a royal commission, Mr Liebmann asked the member for Chisholm:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Okay, but Richard Court keeps threatening to call a state parliamentary inquiry, but he hasn't. Doesn't that say something to you?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wooldridge:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, it says that we've been liaising with Richard Court, we've been looking for the best way to do it.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WA is our model.</PARA>
<PARA>He made this clear on that occasion. Graham Kierath put the lie to it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 17 August.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House of the results of the recent visit to Australia by General Secretary Do Muoi of Vietnam?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="581" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The visit to Australia by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Mr Do Muoi, from 29 July to 4 August, was an important one by any measure. Mr Do Muoi is the most significant political figure in Vietnam. He has presided over a dramatic opening of that economy, which has seen it grow by around nine per cent and develop a private sector which now accounts for 70 per cent of economic activity. It is a country of 70 million people in which Australia has now invested around a billion dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Do Muoi's visit was the first he had ever made outside of Asia. He was accompanied by the Executive Vice Premier, Phan Van Khai, who, we are told, is a possibility of becoming the next Prime Minister. It was the most important delegation ever to come to Australia from Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business group which accompanied Do Muoi was sponsored by three of Australia's most respected companies: BHP, Telstra and the ANZ Bank. All have major current or planned investments in Vietnam. On 28 July, Vietnam became the seventh member of ASEAN. On 11 July, it finally normalised relations with the United States. The General Secretary's program in Australia covered power generation, alumina refining, coalmining, telecommunications, dairy farming, shipbuilding and tourism. Mr John Prescott, the managing director of BHP, had 80 minutes with him in Hanoi a week before he came to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is usual with such visits, the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether he wanted to meet the visitor and to support my speech of welcome at the official lunch. But, in an unprecedented snub, the member for Bennelong and his colleagues refused to receive Do Muoi and refused to send a frontbench representative to the official lunch. So far as protocol records show, this is the first time any Australian opposition has taken such a stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to ask: why did they do it? Was it because of some refined diplomatic sensitivities about him not being a head of government but rather a head of the party? If it was so, why, then, did Mr Howard see Hu Yaobang, who was General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, when he came? Why was Mr Do Muoi not received as other friendly governments have received him, including in Japan and New Zealand a couple of days before he came to Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow foreign minister, who also refused to see him, went on a visit to Vietnam as part of a parliamentary delegation. That delegation, the parliamentary consultative mission, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been a gradual relaxation of political control over private behaviour . . . in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA>Its first recommendation was that Australia should continue its high level of engagement with Vietnam so as to further encourage change, both political and economic. It is true that the opposition have had problems with Vietnam, of course. Honourable members will recall that earlier this year the member for Mayo claimed in a press release that he had raised human rights issues during a meeting with the visiting foreign minister, Mr Cam. In an unprecedented response, the Vietnamese Embassy issued a formal denial that the issue had been discussed at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get down to the real reason the Leader of the Opposition snubbed Do Muoi. It was because he thought there were a handful of votes in western Sydney and Melbourne amongst the Vietnamese community, for the same reason that he told those young people at St Joseph's College he would oppose the export of uranium to France&mdash;telling anyone he speaks to at any time that which they want to hear, as he told the Vietnamese community he would not see him. That is what was wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their policies are wrong. They are wrong for Australia and, worse than that, they are completely gutless. Let me make this clear: there is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition has damaged, probably irrevocably, the Opposition's own capacity to deal with this and the next generation of Vietnamese leaders. Those who have been snubbed in this way will not easily forget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is from the Leader of the Opposition who wants the stewardship of Australia's policy in Asia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can imagine what is thought by those inside of ASEAN who are going to sit down with Mr Do Muoi as a full partner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am certain all members of this House are concerned about the issues of youth homelessness. I am sure many members have also received representations from time to time about this issue and the operations, say, of the youth homeless allowance, and there have been inquiries into that particular payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Justice Statement attempts to direct measures at maintaining the family unit at the difficult time, which often occurs in many families, of adolescence where the level of communication between parents and their teenage children may be at its most difficult and where there is a potential for problems to arise which could, unfortunately, lead to children leaving the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government currently funds 11 adolescent mediation and family therapy services throughout Australia. All but one of those are located in capital cities. The Justice Statement proposes to expand these services quite dramatically by the provision of $3 million over a four-year period. This will enable the services to move outside the capital cities into regional and rural parts of this country. Advertisements have already been placed in major newspapers for the first of the services, advertising the availability of funds. Well over 100 applications have been received for the expansion of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hoped that we will see about 15,000 families assisted annually through these government funded services. Even if only a small proportion of those services maintain the family unit to enable parents to work through with their teenage children particular problems that that family may be going through and as a result we keep that family together and we do not have young teenagers leaving home, I think it is a very worthwhile endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community response to the program has been very strong. I assure the honourable member that the government will be moving as quickly as it possibly can to establish these very worthwhile services beyond Australian capital cities so that as many families as possible can benefit from the provision of adolescent mediation and family therapy services.</PARA>

Why won't the parliamentary delegation led by the honourable member for Kingston, Mr Bilney, also visit Beijing to voice our protest against nuclear testing there?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter which members have apparently had a considerable interest in, since I have had a lot of letters from members on both sides of the House and indeed from a great many constituents representing cystic fibrosis sufferers. I am sure that members will be aware that this is a disease that is genetically inherited. It impairs the functioning of people's lungs and often causes premature death and a great deal of suffering in the meantime. So anything that can appear to relieve symptoms is obviously going to be seized upon and I recognise that cystic fibrosis sufferers and their parents are desperate to try any new treatments that appear to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a very substantial campaign waged, but this decision has to be made on the basis of science&mdash;basically, whether it does in fact provide significant clinical benefits to the majority of patients. If we are to list it on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, it really does need to demonstrate that it is better than the existing remedies. To date the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which advises government on these matters, has decided that the drug does not and has asked the company Roche to provide further information about whether there might be subgroups of patients who would benefit. That information is apparently to be provided to the PBAC later this week so that they can assess whether there are some circumstances in which pulmozyme might be made available to cystic fibrosis sufferers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said to the pharmaceutical companies recently that it is most important, if they are to get drugs listed, that they do the science, they do the clinical trials and they provide that information to government. But government is not going to be swayed by campaigns. We have to get the recommendations from expert committees and act accordingly. I understand that Roche in particular has been encouraging the cystic fibrosis associations around the country to lobby to get pulmozyme listed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, their efforts are better spent providing the data which will convince the experts that it should be listed, rather than lobbying government to make political decisions in these very important and sensitive areas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bass for her question. On previous occasions I have spoken to this House about the terrible human, social and economic cost that the misuse of antipersonnel landmines has caused around the globe. On this national day of action it is incumbent upon all of us to remember that and to have a discussion on how we might best go about lessening this problem and ultimately ending it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The landmines that cause the most problems are the long-lived antipersonnel mines. Further, it seems that the bulk of these are being sown in various parts of the world by insurgent forces during largely internal conflicts. That is why this government is very strongly pushing for a ban on long-lived antipersonnel mines and a tightening of the inhumane weapons convention to prevent the indiscriminate use of mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month I led a delegation from this country to an international conference on this in Geneva. This country committed another $5 million, bringing our total to $20 million since 1989 in the fight against the misuse of landmines. Add to that our specialist human resources that we have thrown at the problem. We were amongst the first into Afghanistan and we were the last to leave. Our people are currently still in Cambodia and Mozambique. As well as the ban on the long-lived landmines, we are urging a ban on all non-detectable mines, a cut-off of the supply of all mines to insurgent groups and to all states which are not party to the convention, and the extension of the convention to cover internal conflicts. We are hopeful, in the lead-up to the coming inhumane weapons convention review by the UN next month, that our position is gaining strength.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of a total ban, the government sympathises very much with those calling for that total ban on landmines. Indeed, last year we supported in the United Nations General Assembly a resolution adopted by consensus that affirmed `the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines as viable and humane alternatives are developed'. However, the problem is, quite bluntly, that many nations are not prepared to forgo the use of landmines because they see them as legitimate defence weapons in their own national interests. My advice is that only nine countries internationally have indicated that they will support a total ban; the vast majority of those nine, it is important to note, with significant qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The verification and enforcement issues are very great problems. But it must be said also for Australia that, with our vast amount of territory to defend, the task of protecting vital installations in a conflict would be much more difficult if the Australian Defence Force were denied the use of landmines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of the matter is simply this: there seems very little likelihood&mdash;if, indeed, any at all&mdash;that a universal, verifiable and enforceable ban on anti-personnel mines could be achieved in the near future. Any unilateral gesture by this government will simply make more vulnerable Australian lives in any potential future conflict. We believe the government's position addresses the problems of the international proliferation and misuse of anti-personnel landmines in a realistic and cogent manner. We will continue to endeavour to push our view in the international forums in the hope of bringing about a better world for those who, hitherto, have dwelled in populations that have suffered from that misuse of landmines.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Can the minister explain the status of relations between the government and CARE Australia following the recent audit into its activities and the referral of matters identified in the audit report for legal advice?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="591" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSTON" MINISTERIAL="DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION & PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I very much appreciate his work, along with that of the member for Aston, on the committee on the code of practice for voluntary organisations. When I tabled the follow-up audit report into CARE Australia in the House on 11 May, I said then I had accepted the report's recommendation to seek legal advice in relation to two projects&mdash;firstly, a food aid project in Mozambique and, secondly, a health care project in Sudan. I had hoped that advice would be available pretty quickly and that, with that, the matter would be finalised one way or the other. In the meantime I took the decision that CARE Australia should receive no new government funding until I had received the legal advice that I had sought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it is now clear that that advice is not going to be available for some considerable time. That delay implies nothing about the nature of the inquiry or of the advice. It is simply an unfortunate, unforeseen delay. Neither the government nor CARE Australia is interested in anything less than a full and proper investigation of those matters. But CARE Australia must be able to get on with its business of providing humanitarian aid to some of the world's most disadvantaged people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to note that CARE Australia has taken positive action to address the problems it faced. Mr Tony Eggleton has been appointed as national director of CARE Australia and will take up his position there next week. CARE has restructured its operations, involving closing down state offices and restructuring management, with an increased emphasis on internal audit. AusAID and CARE are engaged in constructive discussions about follow-up action arising from the audit findings and, as well as that, all outstanding funds have been returned by CARE to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of CARE's positive actions and the unforeseen delays in finalising the legal inquiry, I have decided that from today normal funding arrangements through AusAID will be resumed with CARE Australia. There are some very important principles of natural justice involved in this. CARE Australia is a fine organisation with a proud record of achievement, particularly in delivering emergency relief and longer term development programs. Its efforts in recent months to restructure and rebuild should not go unrecognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, this is a situation where it can truly be said that judgment delayed could mean justice denied. Further delay in that judgment, through nobody's fault, and the consequent denial to CARE of government support for its work, could severely affect CARE's capacity to carry on. That is an outcome which nobody wants and which I could not justify. Nor is it in anybody's interest, in Australia or in those countries where CARE is active, for this organisation to continue to suffer from any lack of public confidence in its capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This announcement today that government funding will be restored is a mark of the confidence which I and the government have in the organisation. CARE Australia will have access to funding through all programs for non-governmental organisations which AusAID administers. The situation will be reviewed when I receive the outcome of the legal inquiry and when the auditors, BDO Nelson Parkhill, complete their follow-up audit of CARE, which is scheduled for November. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, may I say that I hope this decision will assist CARE Australia to continue its process of rebuilding and to continue its tremendously important work for poorer people in developing countries.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are the other matters I referred to in respect of the member for Chisholm earlier today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things will be tested in this commission if the commissioner provides the opportunity for that to happen. But I cannot say that I have ever seen any more unfairness than about this. Here is this huge mechanism set up at public expense&mdash;essentially politically&mdash;for no breach. The only law breached here is the federal Family Law Act, which has been breached by the Liberal Party. There has been no other breach of a law, yet a royal commission has been established which will cost probably $5 or $6 million&mdash;or maybe more. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;having himself been involved with the terms of reference and seeking to politically manipulate this thing against an opponent&mdash;makes very clear that he will not even see the processes run their course. He wants to try to run the processes of the commission in the House of Representatives under cover of privilege.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance Commission, which administers Medicare, has developed criteria to determine the need to open new Medicare offices.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the PBS, drugs and medicinal preparations are made available as pharmaceutical benefits on the recommendation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot match the dramatic appearance of the PLO's Yasser Arafat brandishing a loaded gun before the General Assembly of the United Nations, nor can I match the calibre of Arafat's weapon; however, I can reveal an equally dangerous means of destruction that each one of us&mdash;and, in fact, a majority of Australians&mdash;has in our own homes: this rather innocuous, almost cheerful, green, user and environmentally friendly weedspray, `Roundup 360', bought over the counter at any local supermarket. But, like Arafat's weapon, Roundup is similar to so many other readily available herbicide products in that it is a killer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is no idle claim. A recently published report from the Western Australian Department of Environmental Protection clearly shows that Roundup 360 is capable of killing Australia's native frogs and their tadpoles. Roundup 360 is being innocently used to destroy the very fabric of our environment: our native frogs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report, the brand name `Roundup' and the death of native frogs are only an introduction to the herbicide jigsaw. In fact, Roundup 360, although the target of this startling report, is only one of the range of herbicide products freely available in all retail outlets across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These products contain a cocktail of different chemicals, chemicals that have the potential to have a massive destructive impact upon our environment. Roundup 360 itself is made up of two basic chemical agents: a herbicide known as glyphosate and a wetting agent, or surfactant, which assists in plant penetration. It is great in killing weeds, I am told by my colleagues, but a terrible chemical for the native fauna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another commonly used product, Yates `Once-a-year Path Weeder', contains three different herbicides; namely, 22DPA, Simazine and Amitrole. Other seemingly innocent herbicides, too numerous to discuss today&mdash;one is Zero Weedspray&mdash;contain still other herbicides including Atrazine, Flauzifor and Hexaxinone, and almost certainly contain various surfactants as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the effects of these lethal chemicals on our frogs and, in fact, any other group of native fauna, I was appalled to find that we have absolutely no direct information available&mdash;no data, no information, nothing on the impact these chemicals have on native fauna, particularly frogs. But we do know, from laboratory tests on animals such as laboratory rats and ducks, that most, if not all, of these substances are substantially more toxic than the glyphosate found in Roundup 360. As to the wetting agents found in virtually all these mixes, these are also known to have harmful effects in their own right&mdash;especially on many creatures using gills for breathing, including native fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I was astounded and very concerned to learn of these facts. I was even more astounded to learn that these potentially harmful effects of herbicides on native animals have been known to the scientific community for more than 20 years. For 20 years we have known that the common herbicides we use in Australia are harmful to our native fauna. This is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, an article published in 1977 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herperogica</EMPHASIS>, one of the international reference journals of study in this area, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further investigations of the effects of herbicides to amphibia are clearly needed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, clearly needed almost 20 years ago. It also stated that in a study undertaken 86 per cent of frogs died after being exposed to a herbicide that was only one-eighth&mdash;I repeat: one-eighth&mdash;the solution recommended for agricultural spraying at that time in the United States of America. It is interesting to note that in other parts of the world some positive action appears to have been taken as a result of similar research. In the case of Roundup, for example, a report of the Department of Environmental Protection (WA) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much tighter controls apply to the use of Roundup in aquatic environments in Britain and . . . it is no longer permitted to be used in aquatic environments in the USA.</PARA>
<PARA>As Australians, how are we supposed to interrupt this information? Are our registered standards lower than those employed in other countries? Is our current government complacently sitting by and watching Australia becoming either a testing ground or possibly, more tragically, a dumping ground for chemicals either abandoned or used with greater caution in other countries? Does the government pay only lip-service to the true meaning of environmental protection?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to fully appreciate the magnitude of this issue, we need to take stock of herbicide use in Australia. I am not speaking of a few litres of herbicide being used in the backyard; I am saying that Australia uses some tens of thousands of litres of herbicide each and every day, a substantial proportion of which goes straight into the atmosphere or filters through into our soils and waterways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last two decades herbicides have become an integral part of many primary production industries such as forestry, broadacre agriculture and market gardening. They have become a fundamental tool in conservation strategies, where they are used to control both land based and aquatic weeds. Indeed, I understand that a significant proportion of the limited funds available from federal sources for nature conservation in nature reserves is used to purchase herbicides for weed control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an irony&mdash;federal funds being used to purchase substances that are almost certainly harmful to our native fauna. Sadly, the people who work in these industries and who participate in these conservation programs in good faith believe that these substances have been tested thoroughly for Australian conditions and are, therefore, perfectly safe to use&mdash;and doing no harm at all to any aspect of the environment. How wrong this assumption is turning out to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that we have all placed an inordinate amount trust in&mdash;well, in whom? To whom do we go to ensure that the products we use are safe and that we are given accurate information on the labels and warned as to any possible dangers to our natural environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an attempt to unravel the bureaucratic tangled web that underpins this appalling situation, I got an unprecedented run-around. The health department put me on to the agriculture department which, in turn, put me back to the health department. I then contacted the Environmental Protection Authority which suggested that I should contact the local council&mdash;which, by the way, uses Roundup 360 on street verges in my own electorate and possibly even on the verges in your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker. I finally got on to the National Registration Authority which provided a complex suite of information that discussed everything from schedules to warnings, to labels, to legal contracts&mdash;all marvellous stuff, but who is responsible?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must state categorically that I found the people with whom I dealt to be responsible public officers who seemed to perform their duties with efficiency and provided me with as much information as they could. However, there exists a void of accountability in the Labor Party thinking when it comes to the environment on this particular issue. Actually, the current government is void in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being a realist, though, I freely acknowledge that the issue of herbicides in our natural environment is a large and complex one which cannot be solved through simple legislative change. Moreover, we must acknowledge that herbicide use may be essential to maintain production in many primary industries and that it has an important role in both domestic life and conservation. However, it is also clear that we need to know more about the effects of these substances on our native fauna, particularly our frogs, so that we can determine the most effective way in which they can be used. A regime of use, perhaps based on accurate information derived from Australian conditions as well as sound management and educational practices, is urgently required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that will test the mettle of the Labor government. If they care&mdash;and I suspect that this is a very big `if'&mdash;they will need to take some immediate action. At the very least, I call upon the Labor government to promote local Australian based herbicide studies as a priority; to work with industry, conservation groups and the community to ensure that the needs for all groups are met, without unnecessary environmental degradation; to ensure that an effective program of education on herbicides is in place; to undertake a thorough and independent investigation into recognition and labelling standards in use by the National Registration Authority; to promote the effective monitoring of the impacts of herbicides on the natural environment; and to research into other forms of weed control in Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The onus for protection of our native fauna is on the government, as it should be. If they do not do not look after our environment and clean up their act on this particular issue of herbicides, our native fauna, such as our frogs, will be destroyed. I should remind members that the Liberal Party have just these strategies; we have the policies. If they do not do it, we will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of the eastern tollway, which has been proposed as a second road from Brisbane to the Gold Coast, continues to dominate political debate in Queensland. As a local federal member, I have had no direct involvement in this debate up to this time because the matter is a state government decision and, as was evidenced at the recent state election, it is the state government which is responsible and accountable to the people on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it was only a few months ago that part of the area affected was transferred into my electorate as a result of the 1994 federal redistribution. The community of Rochedale, where the eastern tollway commences, is now part of Moreton. In recent weeks my constituents in that community and the neighbouring suburb of Wishart, who would suffer some effects if the tollway proceeds, have expressed their concerns to me about the state government plan and have asked my views on the matter. I believe that it is my duty to examine the issue and to offer my advice to the state government and to my electorate on this question, which will have a direct bearing on the quality of life of many of my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point for consideration of the issues surrounding the eastern tollway proposal is an acknowledgment that action must be taken to address the problem of traffic congestion on the Pacific Highway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Anyone who travels along this highway at most times of the day or evening knows that the road is almost at its private vehicle capacity. At certain key points along the corridor, delays due to congestion are frequent and unacceptably long. I travelled this road regularly for five years, from 1985 to 1990, as union organiser responsible for Logan City and the Gold Coast region for the Queensland Teachers Union. It was significantly congested at times in those years, and the problem has grown considerably in the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question to consider is whether the current proposal to build a second highway east of the Pacific Highway is the optimum solution for the traffic needs of communities living along this corridor as well as for the communities at each end&mdash;the southern suburbs of Brisbane and the northern suburbs of the Gold Coast. In my view the answer is no. There are a number of reasons behind my conclusion on which I would like to elaborate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that sufficient analysis has been undertaken by transport officials into alternative strategies for reducing private vehicle usage on the Pacific Highway. Much of the necessity for the construction of the eastern tollway is due to the poorly developed local road network serving the communities along the Pacific Highway. There are only a few roads interconnecting the suburbs of Logan City in north-south or east-west directions with each other or with the communities on the other side of the Logan River. Apart from the Pacific Highway, there is only one bridge crossing the Logan River&mdash;at Waterford. Forty per cent of the vehicles on the Pacific Highway between Eight Mile Plains and Beenleigh are local traffic. Seventy-five per cent of vehicle trips in the region are not related to employment or business purposes. For people to move around Logan City communities, they frequently have to use the Pacific Highway for some or all of their journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A proper local road structure would significantly reduce the use of the Pacific Highway for local trips and would, therefore, alleviate a sizeable proportion of the congestion. The already purchased corridor for development of the tollway south of the Logan River can easily be converted to form the basis of part of a local road network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Associated with this problem are the poorly resourced and structured public transport services for these communities, as well as between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The federal government has made a significant contribution to the development and construction of the new rail link between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. I want to ensure that this important new facility is fully utilised and forms a vital part of the optimum transport solution for the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be an expanded, coordinated and integrated public transport strategy. The Queensland government has announced funding for a $100 million busway system, including a busway system from Southport to Coolangatta. A similar service needs to operate in this transport corridor, with busways linking in with railway stations to connect all local communities with the rail service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Timetables of local bus and train services should be synchronised, and a one-ticket system needs to be introduced without delay. `Smart signalling' should be incorporated along all roads that are busways so that public transport services do not suffer long delays from traffic signals at intersections.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures would significantly improve the service and efficiency of public transport and provide a real incentive for people to utilise such services in preference to private vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public transport will be an attractive service if it delivers on the problems of time lengths of journeys, reliability, safety and amenity of service. Travellers locked in long traffic jams watching their work colleagues speeding by in a bus along a busway or in a train will soon learn that the perceived advantages of commuting to places of employment in their own vehicles have disappeared. The investment in bus and rail stock, improved ticketing and timetabling, and synchronised traffic signals, is minuscule compared with the costs in social, economic and environmental terms of building more freeways for private vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There also needs to be further development of the rail link to enable it to provide a dual service between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The rail service needs to be a fast, reliable and affordable service direct to and from the Gold Coast, linking in with local bus services hubbed at key railway stations. It should also be a local commuter service, transporting workers and shoppers to the various communities along this corridor. The rail service direct to the coast will only compete with private vehicle traffic if it is as fast as, if not faster than, a car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An express service must be introduced, with stops at Nerang, Coomera and Beenleigh. It should then go nonstop to Brisbane city, with only three to four stops before Central Station in the CBD. Such a service will require the duplication of the track in some areas. The preserved corridor is wide enough to allow a third track north of Ormeau and a second track south to Robina. Further railway stations should be developed for the multistop commuter service, particularly at Yatala, where a growing industrial estate requires service from the railway line. With all of these public transport proposals, I believe there would be a significant easing of current and future private vehicle usage on the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other measure is also needed. The Pacific Highway should be expanded to six lanes as a matter of priority. The highway corridor is wide enough to accommodate such expansion without land resumption or property losses. This would enable a priority vehicle lane or busway to be introduced to improve accessibility and movement along the highway, particularly at peak congestion periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work on the proposed eastern tollway should be suspended immediately. The environmental costs of this proposal in terms of loss of native fauna and flora, of degradation of local communities, and of loss of quality of life along the route are unacceptable. All of the people living in the path of the proposed tollway have made their views abundantly clear, and the state government should heed their message. The alternative is cheaper, more environmentally and socially sound, and will unite rather than further divide these communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I sum up my proposal: firstly, widen the Pacific Highway to six lanes from Springwood to Nerang; secondly, build a third rail track to Ormeau to enable an express service to be introduced; thirdly, develop a better local road network to remove local traffic from the Pacific Highway; fourthly, expand and coordinate public bus services and rail services in the region, and introduce synchronised timetabling and one-ticket services; and, finally, introduce busways along major roads and the highway with `smart signalling' traffic signals for free movement of buses. With these measures, there will be no need to consider additional road corridors to the Gold Coast for many years to come, if at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Too often over the last few decades we have heard people talk about the issues and some of the problems in regional Australia. People simply say, `Well, you choose to live there. That's your problem. Bad luck.' It is a pretty callous and convenient approach when we consider that 70 to 80 per cent of our exports come out of regional Australia. For the privilege of producing this export income, the people in regional Australia end up with the lowest incomes. Whether you happen to be self-employed, on social welfare, in a small business, or an employee, in net terms you end up with a lower income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the family in regional Australia. If you have to make use of the Child Support Agency, you do not have access to the central office; you have to wait on the telecentre for up to 30 or 40 minutes before your issue is dealt with. Those dealing with HACCA, the parental allowance which replaced the dependent spouse rebate, know that that involves another penalty for regional people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you come to education, you will find, once again, that the percentage of students from regional Australia with a tertiary education is well below the national average. If you look at the school system, many of the regional high schools have at least a 50 per cent turnover rate. Let us just look at Austudy and the number of students going on to tertiary study. It is tough enough these days for families with a student living at home to make ends meet; we all understand that. But, if the student has to go away and live on the living away from home allowance, it becomes very much a matter of survival. So that is another disadvantage for regional people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told in regional Australia that we must adjust&mdash;`Adjust or perish; after all, you choose to live there, so that is your problem.' Not only do we have lower employment opportunities, and the higher unemployment that goes with it, but we have studies by the smaller labour market groups which admit that they cannot get on top of the actuality of the issues in regional Australia. We do not even measure the CPI in regional Australia. We do not even understand how the economy might impact on regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just move on to health, even though I do not really have a lot of time. We are told by the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) that we have an oversupply of doctors and that there should be fewer people going through university. Yet, in many of the smaller communities of my electorate and throughout Australia, it is very difficult, sometimes impossible, to have just one GP in a community. I wonder how many Australians would think about that for a while and say, `I live in a community without a doctor.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a case of whether we are lucky enough to get a doctor, but it also relates to the stability of that service&mdash;the changeover and the ability of, say, a young mother who has a young family to develop a relationship of trust with her GP so that when the children get sick she has confidence to know that the child will be cared for. If we can get a GP into that community, we have this constant turnover. It is very difficult for a young family to survive in the confidence of a stable medical service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to taxation, which is a pretty tedious subject. I mentioned that we do not even know what the effect of the CPI is in regional Australia. We certainly would not know what the taxation aspect is. We can guess that the fuel tax moved from 26c a litre up to 34c or 35c a litre and what effect it might have on regional Australia where this great export industry is trying to compete with world markets. We might guess what the impact of the wholesale sales tax has been since the government told us that there would not be any increase in taxation. Yet immediately it came to power in 1993 it lifted the wholesale sales tax and it has been steadily lifting it over the last three budgets. We might guess what the impact of the fringe benefits tax might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big taxes in the last budget was the wholesale sales tax increase on cars. If you happen to be on a lower income, as I have already said, you tend to reside in regional Australia. Part of that lower income is very much due to the taxation regime of the current federal government. If you have a five to six per cent increase in sales tax&mdash;actually it is more like a 30 per cent increase in sales tax, but it is a five point or six point increase in the wholesale sales tax on cars&mdash;imagine how difficult it is to buy that car that might have to last you a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional development is the catchcry since Kelty discovered regional Australia in recent times. He pioneered that great expedition out of Melbourne and found his way around Australia. It was a wonderful effort, Bill. Do you know what he said about the indirect tax system? He said it is too difficult and we cannot solve it. One of the greatest impacts on the standard of living of regional Australians is the indirect tax system, particularly the fuel excise. I keep coming back to the fact that we do not even measure the CPI in regional Australia. But if you choose to live there, bad luck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly touch on services and mobile phones. Today I tabled a petition with 1,600 or more signatures. We were not even thinking about it. We left it to three big operators. They were so flat out looking after the urban community, they did not even think about the smaller community or even highway 1, where perhaps you would get a reasonable return. What about SBS? Some of the bigger cities are getting it, but what about Port Lincoln and places such as that, which would be numerous around Australia? Triple J? No way. It might come in in some of the cities in 12 months. What about STD rates? Every time you use a telephone in the region you pay STD rates to go outside your own community. Even in some communities you have local timed calls. It is political rhetoric. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I wish to speak about the state of democracy in Western Australia and persistent refusals by the Liberal and National parties in Western Australia to place the Western Australian parliament on a truly democratic basis. This House would be well aware that the Western Australian state parliament is the subject of a massive malapportionment. That malapportionment applies both to the Legislative Assembly and to the Legislative Council. That malapportionment exists and applies today because the conservatives in their modern day guise&mdash;the Liberal and National parties&mdash;have always controlled the Legislative Council of Western Australia and have refused persistent and repeated attempts by the Australian Labor Party to seek to place the Western Australian state parliament on a one vote, one value basis. Very many attempts by Labor over the years have fallen foul of the Liberal-National domination of the Legislative Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The malapportionment in Western Australia is quite clear and quite stark. In the Legislative Assembly there are 34 metropolitan seats and 23 non-metropolitan seats&mdash;the metropolitan boundary drawn effectively by the Legislative Council. The average enrolment for a metropolitan seat in Western Australia is about 23,000. In the non-metropolitan areas the average enrolment is about 12,000. So you can see the stark nature of the malapportionment which occurs in the state parliament: 34 metropolitan seats, with an average enrolment of 23,000; and 23 non-metropolitan seats, with an average enrolment of 12,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Legislative Council that malapportionment rings true as well. The Legislative Council is divided into a number of regions&mdash;three regions from the metropolitan area and three regions from the non-metropolitan area, with 17 members of the Legislative Council from both the non-metropolitan region and the metropolitan region. An equal number of legislative councillors are elected to the Legislative Council of Western Australia&mdash;17 from the metropolitan area and 17 from the non-metropolitan area&mdash;and the maths are quite stark. If you want to be a member of the Legislative Council, you are looking at a mathematical equation of 34 by 23,000 and if you want to be a member of the Legislative Council from a non-metropolitan area, you are looking at a mathematical equation of 23 by 12,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have argued repeatedly in Western Australia that the model which the Western Australian parliament ought to adopt is the model which the Commonwealth parliament adopts: namely, in the House of Representatives, a system of one vote, one value and equal enrolment with a 10 per cent plus or minus disparity; and in the Senate, a system of effectively proportional or regional representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will concentrate on the Legislative Assembly model. The royal commission into executive government in Western Australia&mdash;commonly known as the WA Inc. royal commission&mdash;recommended that a commission on government be established by the state government. The Court state government was most reluctant to embark upon that course, but, after being dragged to the barrier, established a commission on government. One of the terms of reference which the Western Australian royal commission recommended be considered by the commission on government was the electoral system. It is clear that the WA Inc. royal commission saw a clear link between standards of propriety and conduct and the basis of a state parliament's electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Commission on Government reported on very many of those terms of reference in a weighty tome entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commission on Government: Western Australia: Report No 1: August 1995</EMPHASIS>. It is interesting to see the recommendations that the Commission on Government has made in respect of the basis of the parliament in Western Australia, the composition of the Legislative Assembly and the composition of the Legislative Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission conducted public hearings. At one public hearing I appeared to speak on the term of reference that relates to the electoral system and argued then, as I argue today, that the model that we adopt for the House of Representatives is the appropriate model for the Western Australian parliament. I refer to the recommendations of the Commission on Government. The commission deals with the Legislative Assembly of the state parliament in chapter 8 of its report. Recommendation 42 deals with malapportionment and vote weighting. The recommendation by the Commission on Government is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The present metropolitan and non-metropolitan zones for the Legislative Assembly should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The quota of enrolled voters for each Legislative Assembly electoral district should be determined by dividing the total State enrolment, projected four years in advance, by the number of seats to be distributed. A plus or minus 15 per cent deviation from the quota should be permitted based on the criteria listed below.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Electoral Distribution Commissioners, when exercising their discretion over the deviation of plus or minus 15 per cent from the quota, should be required to place the primary emphasis on community of interest as a criterion for the allocation of voters to electoral districts.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondary criteria are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)  means of communication and distance from Perth;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)  geographical features; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)  existing boundaries of regions and districts, including local government boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA>So the clear recommendation of the Commission on Government is that the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia should be determined on the basis of one vote, one value with a deviation from the quota or differentiation of 15 per cent, plus or minus. It is not as good as the House of Representatives model but a massive improvement on the current basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Commission on Government reports on the Legislative Council, which is dealt with in recommendation 52 of chapter 9 of the Commission on Government's report, it formally recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.The present regions for the Legislative Council should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The five, seven member electoral regions should have numbers of electors in each region determined as follows&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to effectively cite the criteria for the Legislative Assembly. The Commission on Government also recommends that, because it is recommending five seven-member electoral regions, the Legislative Council in Western Australia be increased from 34 to 35, which is not something that causes me any great difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the Commission on Government recommends that the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly should be increased by four, from 57 to 61. I must say I find this recommendation somewhat bemusing. On my reading of the various submissions just about every recommendation or submission to the Commission on Government was that the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly and parliaments generally ought to be less rather than more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservative response to the commission's recommendation is as we expected: disappointing. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that is, of Monday, 28 August&mdash;under the heading `Cowan firm on voting reform' carries an article which reports the response of the Deputy Premier of Western Australia and the Leader of the National Party, Hendy Cowan, on the Commission on Government's report. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEPUTY Premier Hendy Cowan says he is still unwilling to accept changes to WA's electoral system but a model which allowed electoral quotas to deviate by about 25 per cent might be more palatable to him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cowan, the leader of the National Party, said his party was happy with the current system of vote weighting&mdash;which the body studying post-WA Inc reforms wants abolished.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cowan said that the COG's recommendation of a deviation of 15 per cent was inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"They . . . have effectively modified the system we've got, so it can't be all bad," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I'd say plus or minus 50 per cent is just right but somewhere between the two is a compromise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It will be interesting what the National Party would accept; my answer is, at this stage, I wouldn't accept any compromise.</PARA>
<PARA>So the formal position of the National Party leader in Western Australia is that you can have equal voting provided you have a 50 per cent plus or minus differentiation&mdash;in other words, no effective change from the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that same article the leader of the state parliamentary Labor Party, Mr Jim McGinty, is quoted as saying that he thought the 15 per cent tolerance suggested by the Commission on Government was probably excessive but `it's so enormously better than what we've got that we would be prepared to accept that'. The article concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the other States had a deviation of only about 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>If I can quote from the body of the COG report, page 274, the commission says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe there is a strong link between the prevention of corrupt, illegal and improper behaviour in the public sector and the electoral system. This view was supported by public submissions to the Commission from across the political spectrum.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear indication by the commission that the adoption of a sound democratic basis to a parliament is necessary to ensure scrutiny of public standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members might be aware that Mr McGinty and others are currently challenging the Western Australian system before the High Court in a case which is due to be heard next month. I call on the Premier of Western Australia to do the right thing and to publicly state that, despite the objections of the National Party, he will implement immediately the recommendations of the COG report and save Western Australian taxpayers the expense of the Western Australian state government defending in the High Court a massively unfair, massively malapportioned and massively undemocratic state parliamentary system, which the Commission on Government, established by Premier Court, says quite correctly ought to be thrown out and thrown out now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The word `entrepreneur' has been given a rough time lately, particularly when we refer to people like Skase and Bond as being entrepreneurs.

The reason that John Cullen invented it is that his best mate's three-year-old son died when he stuck a fork into a power point. How many of us have seen children go to power points and start probing them? He recognised this problem and invented `Protecta-Point', which is, as the article states:</PARA>

<PARA>That is an inventive genius from Wagga Wagga. We move on to the issue of scaldings about which I have some facts that people may not know. Scalds account for two out of three child burn admissions to hospital; three out of 10 require skin graphs; more than 1.5 million children are at risk; and bathrooms are the location of the most serious tap water scalds. For some time people have been trying to work out a way to prevent scalds. In its edition of July 1995, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> tested some of these implements known as anti-scald devices to see which one was most suitable. Its verdict was:</PARA>

<PARA>While we would all agree that the best way of preventing your child from being scalded is by strict supervision while they are in the bath, a couple of gentlemen in my electorate have come up with a device known as a tap cap. It fits on the tap, you put this seal over the top, which only an adult can shift, and that prevents a child in the bath from touching the tap at all. Joe and Dom Sergi are to be congratulated on this device. It is now on the market. It is a simple device which they saw a need for and they set about to overcome the problem of the scalding of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A gentleman from Wagga Wagga in my electorate has invented a system he calls DARTS&mdash;disabled arm rest toilet support. As we know, there is a lot being done for people who are disabled and in most airport lounges or wherever you go where there is a lot of public movement there are toilets for the disabled. In those toilets, alongside the WC, you usually have a metal arm piece so that people can pull themselves onto the toilet. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The invention is simple. There is no cost of installation. It is simple to use. It is simple to maintain.

As I said, he has done a great service, particularly for those people who are confined to a wheelchair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another invention I want to speak about has been invented by Mr Ken Pagden of Leeton. I must thank the federal government because they have seen a winner and they have put forward $100,000 for him to carry on the project. In the Riverina, as you know, we grow quite a deal of rice. In the past disposing of the rice hulls has been a problem, and they have usually been burnt. There are many areas being investigated to see how these rice hulls can be used to great advantage and not wasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ken Pagden, with the assistance of Peter Klatt of the Rice Growers Association in Leeton in the MIA, has come up with an idea of compressing these rice hulls and making them into dunnage. Dunnage is what is used when you are packing, say, pipes or steel. Normally there is a piece of timber between them so that they carry well, do not move and are not damaged in transit. We are finding that this invention has enabled rice hulls to be compressed together and it is better than timber. It is certainly tougher. It is white-ant proof, fireproof and waterproof. So these pieces of what I suppose you call compressed rice hulls known as dunnage will be of great advantage in the shipping and the transport industries, will save the use of Australian timbers and will save those people who are using them a lot of money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the grievance debate this evening I would like to address a particular grievance not only of mine but also of most Australian citizens I have come in contact with over recent weeks: the testing of nuclear weapons by France in the Pacific. Over recent days I have been travelling around my electorate with an Australian flag. The outline of it has been drawn up on a large sheet of white cloth. I have been encouraging people to sign this flag in blue, where the flag will be blue, and in red, where the flag will be red. The white pieces have been blotted out. Over the past four days I have collected thousands of signatures and the flag is starting to take the appearance of an Australian flag as the colour has been added to it. Every one of those signatures represents a person expressing an opinion opposing nuclear testing in the Pacific by the French government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been very interesting to talk with people as they have been signing the flag and to find out why they oppose the testing. I have spoken to diggers who were present in Japan after the Second World War and who saw the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There have been young families most concerned that their children will be able to grow up in a world that will be much the same as the one their parents knew where there is no threat of increasing levels of radioactivity in plant and animal matter, particularly in fish, or increasing radioactive levels of the ocean. Before they go swimming, instead of looking only for faecal coliform counts they will also have to check the background level of radiation or radioactivity. These are some of the concerns. I even spoke with one cancer victim. The origins of cancer are often unknown, but the major concern is that radioactivity can induce cancer and so the concern of that particular person was also one of great concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This flag is a full-sized flag. I can tell all people that next Saturday I will be marching and carrying this flag at a rally in Tahiti to protest against these nuclear tests by the French in what essentially is our part of the world&mdash;the South Pacific. I visited a school last Friday. The school children had seen a report of this on television through the week and they asked me some questions about it. So we happened to have a look at the school atlas. One of the obvious things pointed out by the children was that when you have a look at the map of the world in the rectangular pattern you see that Mururoa Atoll is as far away from France as you can possibly get. That is an interesting fact. It is an interesting fact that the French are quite prepared to test their nuclear weapons but have selected a point on Earth that is almost as far from France geographically as you can get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that I have made continually is that the French, as a nation, are signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Of course, France's being a signatory indicates that it supports the phasing out of nuclear weapons. The obvious question to ask is: if such a nation supports the phasing out of nuclear weapons, why is it prepared to spend the billions of dollars I guess it would cost to test nuclear warheads that it says it is prepared to phase out? Surely, the injection of funds into the economy of Tahiti would be far more sensible and would have far greater effect for the long-term future of the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One family I have spoken with at length has a daughter, a high school student in Australia, with a penfriend in France. She received a letter from her penfriend saying, `I know your government is opposed to France testing nuclear weapons, but please continue to write to me. We do not want the testing either.' We, as a nation, have to continually attempt to get the message through to the French voters. Current polling in France indicates that between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of French people do not support nuclear testing. They do support France as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but they do not support the unilateral actions of their President. It is only the French people who vote for their President. Although he is in office for some time, we have to continue to reinforce our views to the French voters, because it is only through those actions that these tests will cease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other problems that I have with the French debate. France says that it should continue testing in the Pacific because it is safe. Obviously, it is difficult to measure exactly what the risks are. When I was at university I studied geology, and I know that the rock type involved here is basalt. Most amateur geologists know that basalt is a volcanic rock and, as such, it can be porous and can contain a significant number of vesicles where gas can be trapped. If this is the situation and some of the cracks that emanate from the explosion chamber travel as far as such porous rock can, then who is to say at what rate radiation will leak out into the ocean and the effect it will have on the surrounding environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that part of the staple diet of many of the people who live on those atolls is seafood. Many of the insidious effects of radiation over a long period, while not having been studied at great length, are not desirable. France has continually argued that the basaltic rock formations under the atolls will contain the explosions and that it has successfully done so to this stage. Mind you, it has admitted to the occasional partial submarine landslides. On the one hand, it is saying it is safe; on the other hand, it is saying there have been some very negative effects from the 160-odd nuclear explosions that have taken place in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem with basalt is that it is a brittle rock and the shock waves travelling out from the explosion do cause major fractures. Once this solid rock is fractured, it is  permanently fractured; it does not grow back together again. We are talking about not the effect of a single explosion but the cumulative effect of a number of explosions which will eventually destroy the whole rock formation and cause it to collapse. If that happens, there is no possibility of science being able to shore up this collapsing sea mountain. So the leaking of radioactive substances into the ocean would be permanent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity&mdash;somewhat unexpectedly&mdash;to join in the grievance debate this evening because it gives me the opportunity to put in a plea to the Caloundra City Council for a very important environmental area of Queensland known as the Glasshouse Mountains. The Glasshouse Mountains were seen by Captain James Cook during his explorations, and they are renowned throughout Australia as a very beautiful area. They are within an hour's drive from Brisbane. It is a major horticultural area. Basically, everything that goes into a fruit salad, and some things that do not, are grown there: pineapples, custard apples, ginger, strawberries&mdash;you name it, we are fortunate to have them produced in the Glasshouse Mountains. Dairying and beef cattle are also very important to the area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very critical of the state Labor government over its failure to bring in a management plan for the Glasshouse Mountains. Former Minister Robson, who lost her seat at the state election with a swing against her of about 20 per cent, pledged on many occasions that she was going to bring in a management plan and was going to call for comments from the community. It was only in the dying days of her parliamentary term that we saw any evidence that she wanted to have a management plan at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern relates to a proposal, which is currently before the Caloundra City Council, by Swiss company Excel Quarries to expand quarrying operations in the Glasshouse Mountains area. Quarrying operations have been carried out there for a number of years. The existing quarry employs about 20 people, and the extraction area is currently 16 hectares. In recent times, the quarry company has been buying up other properties. Indeed, I understand that it now owns over 90 hectares, 42 hectares of which it is proposed would be included within the area of a new quarrying permit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you can imagine, such a proposal being put forward for such a beautiful environmental and tourist area would create great community concern and debate. I have been approached by very many constituents who are worried about what is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing quarry has a lifespan of about 12 years. I understand from discussions with the quarry company that, even if the permit were granted and the quarrying area were extended from 16 hectares to at least 42 hectares, no additional jobs would be created. The existing quarry has a life of 12 years and the existing jobs are not in doubt, at least not for that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application currently before the Caloundra City Council seeks to extend the life of the quarry from 12 years to at least 50 years, and maybe 75 years. I always like to make a decision based on the facts, so I contacted Excel Quarries and said that I would like to inspect the present quarry and, indeed, the area which is proposed to be subjected to quarrying in the future. I was impressed with what I saw at the quarry operation. In my view, it certainly is a very well-run quarry. The company has gone out of its way to minimise the impact of that quarry on the local community. I had the opportunity of visiting all aspects of the quarry. I thank the company for its courtesy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do have a concern that such a massive quarrying operation is a use that is totally incompatible with the Glasshouse Mountains as a sensitive and fragile environmental and tourist area. I think it is entirely inappropriate for the Caloundra City Council to commit the community to the presence of such a quarrying operation for 50 or 75 years. I looked at the end use plans for the area to be subjected to quarrying. A number of proposals were put forward. Obviously those proposals, if they were carried out, could in the end be desirable. However, to give a quarry an extended life for 50 to 75 years is effectively to give a blank cheque to the company. None of us will be around in 50 to 75 years to monitor whether the end use proposals of the company are to be implemented. So I believed I had to take a stand and, consequently, along with very many other residents of the Sunshine Coast, I lodged an objection to the quarrying proposals currently before the Caloundra City Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that the council admits that it would have no control over any increased production levels at the quarry. The quarrying company claims that the level of production would not increase but the council would have no control over increased quarrying operations, should these occur, and the company itself admits that the level of quarry production will be governed by the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that the application by Excel Quarries is not in any way, shape or form at present a matter of federal political responsibility. It certainly would have been the easy course of action for me, as a federal member of parliament, simply to advise those who contacted me that they should refer the matter to the Caloundra City Council or perhaps to the local state member. But I think it is important, as a member of parliament representing people in the national parliament, to take an interest in all spheres of governmental activity, be they state, local or federal. I felt it important, therefore, to look at the relevant merits and demerits of the arguments being advanced in favour of and against the quarry expansion. I did not have any hesitation, after considering all the issues, in coming down on the side of the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to an objection lodged with the Caloundra City Council by Mr Ren Hinton of Glasshouse Mountains. His objection is based on seven major grounds. The council, in my view, ought to look very closely at what Mr Hinton has said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The quarry expansion is contrary to objectives 6b, 8c, 9a and 10a of the City Strategic Plan.</PARA>
<PARA>When one looks at the strategic plan, one sees that objective 6b is `to ensure that extractive industry activities are conducted so as to minimise any detrimental effects on the amenity of surrounding land uses'. Given the fact of primary production, given the fact that an increasing number of people are coming to live in the area, given the fact that there is tremendous tourism potential, it is fairly clear that a massive quarrying operation for 50 or 75 years is totally incompatible with the application which is currently before the council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Objective 8c seeks to `maintain and preserve the amenity and character of rural areas'. That speaks for itself. Objective 9a seeks to `encourage the development of tourist facilities in appropriate locations'. Objective 10a seeks to `conserve environmentally and/or visually significant areas of the city in an appropriate natural or rural state'. When one looks at all those objectives, it is fairly clear that the application fails on all counts. According to Mr Hinton&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The proposal is contrary to the provisions of Clause 46(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Town Planning Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The land use surrounding the quarry and the haulage route is a mixture of rural and rural residential type development which is incompatible with the quarry expansion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The haulage route (Coonowrin Road) and alternatives are inappropriate in terms of traffic requirements, safety and traffic noise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The quarry expansion would be a desecration of an area that is sacred in Aboriginal Mythology and traditionally important to present-day Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The further intrusion of extractive industries in this area is inappropriate in that it conflicts with the lifestyle and aspirations of an increasing number of residents. . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reopening the debate on the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill, I would like to say that the coalition very strongly supports the concept of superannuation, as I do myself. But that support, of course, is conditional on any superannuation scheme being properly structured, being relatively easily understood by the people who use it, being relatively simple and predictable, and by the scheme being worthwhile. I believe that on many of these criteria, if not all of them, the present government's scheme is shown to fail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in a recent survey by the Australian Consumers Council which showed that 50 per cent of participants in superannuation believe that it is a very poor investment. Apparently, the government is about to bombard us with an expensive advertising scheme costing $12 1/2 million. If they are going to expend that much of taxpayers' money, I believe the very least they can do is tell the full story on superannuation in this country as proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister this year has given a number of speeches about superannuation which have amounted to little more than hyperbole. We have had speeches on other topics which have fallen flat or on proposals such as changing the flag, bringing in a new republic, the budget that was brought down this year and so on. But when it comes to superannuation&mdash;which, it seems to me, is almost his last card on which to go ahead and win the election&mdash;he has done little more than exaggerate the benefits of the scheme and gloss over the numerous shortcomings within the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has built up a quite inaccurate and unrealistic expectation out there amongst workers who will be participating in the scheme. I believe that this cynical exploitation of vulnerable people with grand undeliverable promises will be seen through well and truly before the election comes about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote from a couple of the Prime Minister's speeches. On 12 May this year, at the Collingwood Football Club&mdash;what you would be doing talking about superannuation on such an occasion I am not sure&mdash;he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, let me tell you now, I'll give you the punch line, what it all means. It means this, that a person on average weekly earnings&mdash;that is $33,000&mdash;will end up at the end of their working lives with a lump sum of $470,000 in today's dollars. And they will have an annual annuity of $30,000. If we take somebody on twice average weekly earnings, they will end up with a lump sum of $670,000 and they will have a pension of $42,000.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of the Prime Minister&mdash;a little bit ambiguous but I was left with the clear impression after reading that that you will get both a whacking great lump sum and, on top of that, this very generous annuity. That, of course, is not the case and I will come back to that later. At the launch of the advertising campaign on superannuation, which I earlier referred to, at the Berlei factory at Rydalmere in Sydney on 8 August this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give an example, someone on average weekly earnings now&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `now'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that's someone on about $32-$33,000&mdash;when they retire, they will retire on a lump sum just under half a million dollars.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And this will produce an income stream in retirement which will guarantee them a much higher standard of living than they have today.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, a little ambiguous, but the only conclusion you can come to is that those people will have a much higher standard of living than they have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who would the Prime Minister be addressing at a Berlei factory? I presume the predominant number in the work force would be women. They would need to be earning $32,000 to $33,000, if not more, to have that much higher standard of living that the Prime Minister talked about, and I doubt if very many, if any, of them would be earning that amount. Even if they got the full lump sum and that was turned over into an annuity, they would be earning only $25,892 and, clearly, they would be on a lower standard of living. Again, the Prime Minister's words are found wanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2002 there will be a contribution for every worker of 15 per cent towards superannuation. That will be made up of nine per cent coming from the employer. That is already under way, building up from between four, five and six per cent now. On top of that we will have a one per cent contribution from the employee starting in 1997-98, which will go up to two per cent the next year and three per cent the year after. That will be matched by an equal contribution of one, two and three per cent by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a person who is, say, 18 years old now and who will turn 25 in the year 2002, if they work full time on average yearly earnings of $33,000, in the year 2042 will have a lump sum accumulated in excess of $461,000. But that is dependent on a number of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, you have to work for 40 years, which not too many people do now. The average male presently works for 39 years, and that is falling away rather rapidly. The average for women is 17 years, and that is increasing. Almost nobody in the future will be working 40 years. Secondly, they will have to be working full time. There will be no room for part-time work to build up this sort of lump sum. Thirdly, no breaks will be allowed in that work pattern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, you will have to be on average weekly earnings. It is worth noting that 70 per cent of the population today earns something less than average weekly earnings. In other words, 70 per cent will be excluded from getting the sort of lump sum that the Prime Minister was talking about in these speeches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need some explanation from the government as to how average weekly earnings will be calculated. If you start on a lower wage and halfway through that 40 years you suddenly crack the average weekly earnings and go on to earn a greater amount, that still will not qualify you because that average weekly earning will have to commence at an earlier stage. I will not go into the technicalities of that but it is a point that needs to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, this large lump sum is based on an annual average three per cent inflation rate, which, quite frankly, I doubt will be attained between now and the year 2042. Also, it is based on average wages increasing by four per cent every year on average. Perhaps most remarkably, it is also predicated upon the funds in which the superannuation amounts are invested returning seven per cent on average every year for the full 40 years, which is somewhat fanciful, to say the least. It sounds a bit like Bob Hawke's promise that by 1990 no child would live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that if you took the average wage now, taking into account full-time and part-time workers&mdash;25 per cent of workers at present are part-time workers and that percentage is increasing rapidly every month&mdash;the average wage is $548.10, a far cry from the full average wage of $650 that the Prime Minister talks about. With an average four per cent increase every year on $548, you would be earning $3,462 in the year 2042. I seek permission to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the real average weekly total earnings over the last 12 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table clearly shows that over the last 12 years, from 1982-83 up until last year, there has been a real increase in wages of a male worker of only about $40-odd, which represents something less than half a per cent per year increase. If we can achieve some of the figures that the government is talking about, we will be pleased indeed. Up until now we have not received much of the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, after the Prime Minister's speech at the Berlei factory, George Megalogenis of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> wrote an article saying that the Prime Minister had exaggerated the situation somewhat. The Prime Minister himself replied with a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never suggested that people on average incomes today will be entitled to pay-outs as large as $462,000 overnight.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a complete and utter contradiction of what he said at the Berlei factory and on which the journalist was commenting. Here is the Prime Minister in a letter to the paper denying what he said in that particular speech. It is an incredible situation when the Prime Minister denies something that he said only a few days before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested to see what will be included in this television advertising campaign. I do not think there will be much mention of the figures that have to come together for that large lump sum to appear. There will probably be no mention that we have to have no more than three per cent inflation on average every year, a four per cent increase in wages every year, and a seven per cent return on fund earnings. I think the chances of those figures coming together for 40 years would be remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt very little mention will be made of the fact that the unemployed will miss out altogether. They will not be receiving any lump sum. In fact, it must be very frustrating for unemployed and self-employed people who are struggling now. The farmers in my electorate come to mind. They are already feeling left out. The gap between the rich and the poor will continue to widen. I am told that the average worker on a low income is now getting only about 30 per cent of average weekly earnings. So they will be well and truly left out. They will be contributing to this superannuation scheme only to have the dubious privilege of forgoing part of their pension. I do not see this scheme as being of great benefit to those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women have really been left out by the Prime Minister. I am surprised that he did not mention women when we was talking at the Berlei factory because most of its employees are women. The average woman now earns less than half of what the average male earns. This is simply because women tend to do more part-time work; their work pattern is interrupted with having children and family duties; they tend to be lower paid; they tend to fill the lower ranked jobs; and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the average woman worked full time, received average weekly earnings for the 40 years, attained the lump sum of $462,000 and turned that lump sum into an annuity, what would she get? This is a poke in the eye for women. Here is sexual discrimination for you. The average male would get $29,000, but the average female would get only $25,000. The average female would get $4,000 a year less than the average male. The average female would get $80 a week less because women tend to live longer. It is an incredible situation, and I dare say that it will not be mentioned in the television advertising campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that will not be mentioned in the campaign is the fact that, even if you want to take the lump sum, you will not be entitled to get the full amount of $462,000. I am told by the library that you can receive $418,000 of that lump sum tax free but that the high marginal tax rate of 48.4 per cent will apply to the remaining $44,000. In other words, you will pay in excess of $21,000 in tax. So much for getting your claws on the $462,000! You would be able to get only $440,000 of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Prime Minister's speech at the Collingwood Football Club&mdash;I read it earlier&mdash;he said that you can get both the lump sum and `an annual annuity of $30,000', which in the case of a woman is only $25,000. But the fact is that you do not get both. You get only one or the other. That should be spelt out clearly in the television advertising campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other parts of this scheme which alarm me. For example, if you retired in the year 2042 at the age of 60 and you took the lump sum of $440,000, as I understand it there is nothing to stop you from blowing the lot of it and going on the full pension at the age of 65 anyway. That is a deficiency in the scheme, and the responsibility for that will fall on both sides of the House. That is something that should be debated and addressed in the course of time. It is a weakness in the scheme. In a strict sense, it is more a savings scheme than a retirement scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, we have to remember that these superannuation contributions are not just an addition that falls into the lap. You are forgoing wages in a sense. In effect, you will be forgoing 15 per cent of your wages. As I said, low income earners will be hit particularly hard because they are forgoing not only their wages but also the pension that was going to fall due to them anyway. </PARA>

Of course, this increase will cost jobs because employers will have to outlay the extra nine per cent. It just does not come out of nowhere. Even when it was three per cent when the scheme kicked off, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the ACCI, came out with the study saying that that amount alone would cost about 50,000 jobs. As desirable as it might be to start the superannuation scheme&mdash;I do not deny that&mdash;there will nevertheless be a cost to jobs. If the three per cent contribution cost 50,000 jobs, how many jobs will the 15 per cent contribution cost? Possibly it is in the order of 250,000 jobs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to hear more from the government about where this money will be invested.

If we are going to have vastly increased sums flowing through into superannuation schemes, I for one would not like to see them being invested in blue-chip companies as it would overly inflate their prices. Possibly more money will be invested overseas. I see that major pension funds now invest up to 15 and 25 per cent overseas. Some are projecting that that figure could rise to 40 per cent. I would like to hear more from the government on that particular point and on whether some of this money will eventually be going into infrastructure projects in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a cost to the government. At the moment they are forgoing tax revenue because of tax concessions of about $5 billion a year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill is technical in nature. It opens up the very important national policy question of superannuation. But the bill itself is restricted to the late payment component of the superannuation supervision levy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991 imposed a levy on the superannuation funds. The levy is imposed to recoup costs associated with prudential and other supervision of the superannuation funds by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The bill before the House makes some changes to the calculation of the late lodgment penalty for the levy component. The bill raises the general question of superannuation, and it is really in the general areas that debate on the bill has fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat bemused to find members of the opposition standing up and criticising superannuation because they really have not had a great deal of interest in superannuation. Until this government came into office in 1983, superannuation was treated by those opposite as a preserve for upper middle and high income people. It was a tax concession for people in those areas. There was no attempt to develop a national superannuation policy either for retirement incomes or for the purpose of national savings. So it was treated by those opposite when they were in government as a nice little tax break for upper income earners. Those opposite were not concerned about access to superannuation for low or middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983 there has been a range of very important effects of this government's policies in the superannuation and retirement income area. Firstly, there has been a massive expansion in the number of employees in the country who have access to superannuation and who take it up. Secondly, we have seen a massive increase in the amount of funds held by the superannuation industry, which of course has a direct positive effect on national savings. Thirdly, we have seen, particularly in recent times, a concerted effort on the part of the government to make sure that low income earners and those people who have small amounts in superannuation funds, particularly where those small amounts are in more than one fund, are treated fairly and equitably. So we have seen a massive expansion of access to superannuation for the Australian working public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a decade of reform. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics in June 1993 showed for that 10-year period a massive expansion in superannuation access. The ABS bulletin of 23 June 1993, effectively covering that 10-year period in office, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation coverage of employed Australians rose to 80 per cent in November 1993. This continues the upward trend reported in November 1991 when the level of superannuation coverage had increased from 51 per cent in November 1988 to 71 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 6.1 million employed people aged 15 to 74 were covered by a superannuation scheme . . . 82 per cent of men had superannuation coverage . . . The level of coverage for women was 78 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wage and salary earners reported the highest superannuation coverage rate with 89 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>So those are the figures for the decade. We should bear in mind, firstly, that there has been continued expansion since that time and, secondly, that in 1983 when this government came into office the number of employees with access to superannuation was less than 40 per cent of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the net effect of policy to date? It has been a massive expansion of access to superannuation, which brings with it very important consequences for retirement incomes and a massive boost to the potential for contribution to national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives in the budget for this year build on the previous superannuation policies put in place by the government. We now see a national superannuation policy which seeks to enhance and further expand upon both the access to superannuation and the contribution that that makes to national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's superannuation policy was very well and clearly set out by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in a speech to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia on 17 August this year. He clearly outlined the philosophical attitude behind the government's retirement incomes and superannuation policies when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's retirement incomes policy will continue to have three elements:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-the age pension and associated social security arrangements, which provide an income safety net in retirement;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-a compulsory saving element, achieved through the Superannuation Guarantee and now minimum employment contributions required under industrial agreements and awards; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-a voluntary element of superannuation, encouraged by the substantial tax concessions available for superannuation saving and the Government's matching payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will result in most employees having the equivalent of 15 per cent of their earnings directed towards their retirement savings from 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be achieved through a process that does not involve any reduction in employees' existing disposable incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matching Government contribution is specifically targeted to low and middle income earners. This group includes a significant proportion of women who, prior to 1983, traditionally missed out on access to superannuation benefits and concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The end result will be significantly higher incomes in retirement for ordinary workers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the philosophical approach of the government and is something that stands in stark contrast to the attitude of those opposite when they were in power. In continuing his speech, the Treasurer made some important points about the contribution that the budget superannuation measures will make to increasing national savings and, consequently, reducing the current account deficit. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the boost to savings from superannuation will be very substantial:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the award and Superannuation Guarantee arrangements already in place are estimated to boost national savings by around half a per cent of GDP this financial year;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">over the next five years, that is, by the year 2000-2001, the combined effect of all our superannuation measures is estimated to boost savings by two per cent of GDP;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">by the year 2005-2006, a decade from now, the impact on savings from superannuation is estimated to be three per cent of GDP; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">by the year 2020-2021 the impact will be more than four per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus there will undoubtedly be a rapid build up in national savings from superannuation over the next five years, with a slightly slower build up over the following five years, and more gradual additions over the next 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These figures demonstrate the complete falsity of Opposition claims that our superannuation policy won't provide a substantial boost to national savings until 2020 or 2042.</PARA>
<PARA>Opposition misinformation on the effect of the government's superannuation measures contained in the last budget has become something of an art form. I will refer to an article by Mr Megalogenis in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian.</EMPHASIS> He is a writer to whom the previous speaker, the opposition spokesman and member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), referred. Mr Megalogenis makes some interesting analyses which I think are correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third strand of the Treasurer's speech was in respect of retirement incomes. I will again quote from his speech, because it gives the philosophical flavour of the government's approach over a long period. He said that the government's approach had been:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . built up slowly over ten years to improve retirement incomes, to provide for Australia's ageing population, and to increase national saving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People support the system and want certainty and stability&mdash;but the Opposition continually refuses to endorse its main elements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has consistently and over a long period failed to match our commitment to ensuring the adequacy of the age pension. Remember, one of John Howard's first steps as Treasurer was to cease indexation of the aged pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers are now making plans for their retirement based on the full implementation of the Superannuation Guarantee, without any certainty from the Opposition about a bipartisan approach to this important long term policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, the Opposition's policy appears to be to freeze arrangements under the Super Guarantee and not implement the initiatives announced in this year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, Mr Howard said in his reply to the Budget "that on a change of government any existing retirement benefits will be preserved."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberals' apparent policy to freeze the superannuation guarantee at present levels and not to match employee contributions would mean a major reduction in retirement incomes for Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA>That sentiment is echoed in the article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which I referred to. I was not proposing to refer to it but, given that the shadow spokesman referred to an earlier article by Mr Megalogenis in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, I thought it was timely to pull out today's copy. This article is found on page 11 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and is entitled `Battlers will be first to fall into Howard's super trap'. How appropriate! The article starts with the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard and Peter Costello risk the credibility of their economic attacks on the Government if they persist in making misleading outbursts on superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) are squarely in the frame for their `misleading outbursts on superannuation'. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard tarnished his self-image as an honest politician this month when he said that Keating's promise of a super bonanza is "very deceitful and a distortion of the facts".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard said: "He [Keating] runs around Australia saying under his policy workers will be able to retire on $480,000. The problem is it only applies to somebody who's now younger than 11."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard was wrong on two counts. The number Keating has been quoting out of the Budget papers is $462,000; and the person it refers to is now 18 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Leader of the Opposition has given a massive, deliberate and complete distortion of the implications of the superannuation measures introduced by the government in the course of the budget. Mr Megalogenis goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Howard compounded his error with his attempt to rebut Treasurer Ralph Willis's claims that workers would lose up to $250,000 in benefits under the apparent Coalition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">" He [Willis] was quite dishonestly observing that I was going to snuffle out workers' superannuation entitlements . . . We're certainly not going to leave people worse off as far as superannuation is concerned," Howard said.</PARA>
<PARA>Then there is some helpful analysis from Mr Megalogenis. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Willis was saying was clear enough. If the Coalition maintains its present policy to freeze the Superannuation Guarantee Charge at the levels applying at the next election, then ordinary workers would end up with much lower payouts than under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that `ordinary workers would end up with much lower payouts than under Labor'. That is absolutely correct. Here we have an opposition, which over 10 years ago was only interested in superannuation for upper middle and higher income earners&mdash;a tax concession for higher income earners&mdash;now embarking on a strategy which will have the effect, according to Mr Megalogenis this morning, of ordinary workers ending up with `much lower payouts than under Labor'. The analysis goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Willis argument is self-evident&mdash;a 5 or 6 per cent SGC will deliver a smaller super benefit than the 15 per cent benchmark being phased in by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Howard will be vulnerable on this point for as long as he continues to put off industry and employer calls to embrace bipartisanship on the SGC. Howard would have a hard time supporting the line run by John Hewson at the last election that a freeze on the SGC somehow preserves people's existing entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that `a freeze on the SGC somehow preserves people's existing entitlements'. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Howard's battlers&mdash;the low-income workers who can't afford to top up their super&mdash;who are the most vulnerable. Freezing the SGC and then providing tax incentives for voluntary savings above that level will not help them break out of the small-amounts trap.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the low-income workers who can't afford to top up their super&mdash;who are the most vulnerable. Freezing the SGC . . . will not help them . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty consistent with the entire approach that the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition parties take. Because Mr Megalogenis has referred to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, let me give you his analysis of Mr Costello:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Costello repeatedly misquoted the Treasury estimates on the impact on the Budget measures on national savings; at one stage he got wrong the date for the implementation of the policy; and he suggested that paying the cancelled One Nation tax cuts into workers' super accounts would "be decreasing savings".</PARA>
<PARA>The inaccuracies diminished Costello's performance. The article refers to a debate that the Treasurer comprehensively won on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There we see the full array of government measures over more than a decade to massively expand the access of superannuation to ordinary Australian workers, to massively expand the pool of national savings and to ensure that, together with the age pension preserved by Labor, Australia's ageing population will have a much better go at retirement incomes in the future. What do we see from those opposite? We see from those opposite what we have always seen: no interest in superannuation other than how it might apply to higher income earners by way of tax concession arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow spokesman also referred to the Prime Minister's Berlei speech. I will finish with a quote from the Prime Minister's speech because this very aptly summarises the philosophical position of government members. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Award superannuation is one of the great undertakings of the last decade, and it is now starting to blossom as a result of the Budget measures we announced just a few months ago. It will be such that by 2002 . . . every Australian working person will have 15% of their income going on their account into a superannuation fund&mdash;into a superannuation account for them. What this will mean is when they retire, someone joining the work force will retire on what is now twice the age pension, someone who is in the work force already&mdash;in their 30s perhaps&mdash;will retire on about three-quarters of the age pension, plus the age pension. So, it's going to mean a dramatic lift in the standard of living of Australians in retirement, and, of course, put together a huge pool of national savings, which can make a country stronger, which means we will rely less on overseas savings and overseas debt, and which means we can power along investment and employment and exports.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the approach of those on this side: ensuring that the vast bulk of Australians have access and opportunity as far as superannuation is concerned, ensuring adequate and sensible retirement incomes policies but also ensuring that we have a massive pool of superannuation funds as a boost to national savings and as an offset to the current account deficit.</PARA>

Since 1983, this government, the Hawke and Keating government, has attempted to control the levers, to manage Australia's economic and social policies, but the result has been a disastrous current account deficit, a disastrous foreign debt, increasing taxes, increasing government expenditure and less opportunity for individuals to take initiative and look after themselves and their family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, there is a great feeling of cynicism in the community about the new-found zeal of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to introduce another form of compulsory superannuation. This is particularly so because it is accompanied by a grossly expensive advertising campaign that is running prior to calling the federal election. The campaign will cost Australian taxpayers some $12 million at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it little wonder that Australians see the Prime Minister's posturing in this way as another example of promises from a Prime Minister which can be regarded as pie in the sky? There is good reason for Australians to feel cynical and very disappointed about this government. Yet a debate on savings for this nation and the future should be accompanied by a lot more enthusiasm and a lot more commitment from Australians generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are entitled to feel very cynical because of the way in which they have been treated and the way in which the Prime Minister, since he became Prime Minister, has broken so many promises and left them in the lurch. In this current budget we see the government's proposal to abandon tax cuts that the government promised, that the Prime Minister promised, and that the Prime Minister enshrined in law, referring to them in his infamous statement as l-a-w. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has abandoned the tax cuts. Now he is saying, `If you elect me'&mdash;heaven forbid!&mdash;`at the next election, I on behalf of the government will in my next term of office introduce a form of superannuation contribution from the taxpayer to the low income earners of Australia which will make up for the l-a-w tax cuts that I promised them in the last election and that I have now taken away from them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is good reason for people to be very disappointed about this at a time when most Australians would rather see us devoting our time and attention to a bipartisan debate about savings, about encouraging families and about encouraging people to be self-reliant. How can we do that when the Australian people have been treated this way by the Prime Minister?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He cannot be trusted, as my friend says. He breaks promises, he brings in law to introduce tax cuts for low income people and then throws them on the scrap heap and now he turns around and spends $12 million of taxpayers' money and says, `Hang on, forget about that, after the next election I'll give you what I said I'd give you in tax cuts, which is what I said you could spend on your family and children, but I will give it to you in another way. Actually, I won't give it to you; I will compulsorily take it from you and put it into a superannuation fund.' There is a hell of a lot of cynicism and a lot of bitter disappointment in the Australian community because of this government's shocking record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill that we are debating is an administrative bill designed to allow the superannuation governing authority to introduce a levy for late lodgment of returns. I have no objection in principle to that, but it is important to note that in 1992, when the principal bill was introduced by this government, a ceiling of $30,000 per annum levy was set for the superannuation authority on superannuation funds. Then an amendment was passed which said this could be fixed by regulation. At the moment, the ceiling is $200 per $500,000, or part thereof, of the superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite members to think very carefully. That has in fact given particularly this government the opportunity to raid the savings of Australians in the superannuation funds, up to $30,000 per fund. I am not suggesting that they are going to do it now, but it is just an indication of where superannuation has got out of control under this government. It is just another example of the doors they have opened here, there and everywhere to enable them to interfere in the rights of people and to enable them to raid the savings of people when it suits them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $12 million advertising campaign that our constituents are being forced to pay for&mdash;they were not consulted by the Prime Minister about that either&mdash;talks of the collection of compulsory superannuation contributions to begin after the next election using taxpayers' money to pay a levy in conjunction with that. It is all compulsion and it is all using other people's money. I remind people of that. Sometimes people forget that it is not government money&mdash;it is other people's money, the people's money&mdash;that they are throwing around and making promises about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's promises cannot be relied on because they do not keep them. That is fundamentally the problem. How can you construct a substantial savings policy for this nation when the government cannot be trusted, for good reason, to look after it, to honour its commitments? It cannot be trusted because it will vary them after the election if it gets a mandate&mdash;heaven forbid. I hope it does not; I do not believe it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem I find is that we have the lowest level of saving in this economy since we started to record details of saving levels. Also, we have had very high unemployment&mdash;one million, now down to 800,000. I am happy that a lot of people have now found employment&mdash;we all are&mdash;but a lot of those people who have found employment are in part-time work or in training programs and, thus, not in unemployment statistics. There is a great deal of concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe&mdash;I try to regard myself as a practical person&mdash;that what the government should be concentrating on as a matter of urgency is ways to stimulate employment and ways to overcome the deterrents to employment that have been far too evident under the last 12 or 13 years of Labor government, and it has been getting worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses are the engine of the economy. They have the potential to provide hundreds of thousands of new jobs in Australia. They cannot do that because they are being pushed back and down as a result of this government's bad policies. The recession has hurt them very badly. Many of them have not recovered and will not be back in business again. Those that have survived are finding it almost impossible to carry on because they have not recovered. They have used their reserves; they have borrowed more. They have had three interest rate rises under this government and they fear another one, by Christmas or early in the new year. They have no confidence any longer to make further investments, to take risks and to offer people, particularly young people, new jobs, which is what we would want them to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's answer to that is very inadequate. The government's policy of spending $12 million to sell this compulsory superannuation scheme is only going to add to the cost of business and small business in Australia and therefore deprive many Australians, especially young Australians, of a job opportunity in 1996-97. That is the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why is this government not addressing the oncosts to employment and giving that at least equal billing, at least equal priority, in its dying months of government in Australia? Why is it not addressing the very important debate on retirement policy and savings? The government is not doing that at all. If you have a look at the business the government proposes to bring into the House this session and at the comments by the ministers, the senior ministers particularly, you will see that very little attention is being paid to the bottom line that Australia needs to address urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bottom line is: why are our savings so low, why are our unemployment rates constantly too high, why are the compliance costs for taxation too high, why are industrial laws not encouraging people to employ, to take risks and to make new investments, why is our current account deficit the worst it has been and almost the worst in the world, why is our foreign debt so high, how are we going to control this and what are we going to do about it? There is very little attention paid to that. But we do have a $12 million glitz campaign, paid for again by my constituents and yours, to sell this government's new found zeal in respect of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), attempted to reduce this debate to a class war and made mention that he had not heard anyone on this side talk about savings, retirement policy or superannuation. That is absolute nonsense and humbug. I do not think he does himself any credit to try to reduce the debate to a class war. In fact, you might remember in another place, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the Victorian parliament in the 1970s and 1980s, debating equal opportunity law and debating the need for superannuation to be reviewed so that women in Australia could have equal opportunity to save through superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have all had a fairly long-term commitment to do with superannuation. I do not want to hear any more nonsense such as that from the member for Perth, who attempts to muddy the water by turning the debate into a class war. If he wants to fight that way, the figures are too stark for him to defend. Out in the hustings, when the real election campaign starts, the truth of his government's mismanagement will destroy his political career. If he wants to hasten the process, that is fine by me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters that Australian people are expressing caution about in relation to the government's approach to superannuation. One of them is: what is going to happen with the management of all the money this superannuation policy is designed to attract? We have to get used to the expression `trillions of dollars'. That is, in fact, what we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By compulsion, this government is proposing to the nation that huge chunks of people's private funds and their efforts from working, for wages and in business, are to be taken from them by compulsion, invested by people into investments that the individual does not have much say in at all. If the Prime Minister does not believe me and does not think that is what the Australian people are worrying about, then I suggest he come down from his lofty tower and talk to the people. There is a heck of a lot of concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is this to be managed and by whom? Some of the people who have enormous say already in the placement of superannuation investment funds have already made some rather unfortunate statements about the approach to investment of these trillions of dollars that will come their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday 4 August. An article headed `Cautious Capitalists' attempted to analyse some of the views of people who are heavily involved in the management of superannuation fund investments in Australia. One of the quotes came from the industry fund guru of superannuation in Australia: none other than the ACTU Secretary, Bill Kelty. I am sure we all know Mr Kelty&mdash;a very interesting person, a very strong personality and a director of one of the major union funds in Australia. He is associated with many of the directors of other industry and union funds in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this article, Mr Kelty talked about the question of corporate governance, about whether investment moneys entrusted in their care by Australians in the superannuation funds should be dovetailed and placed in certain types of investment, selected by the board for criteria other than financial performance and expectation. He talked about important matters, such as the environment and human rights, and so on. They are all important things. I, for one, believe that corporate governance always should have regard to moral and ethical issues. But the bottom line must be that the financial safety of shareholders' funds has to be ensured. That is a principle of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in this article Mr Kelty is quoted as saying `we must not get carried away' with corporate governance&mdash;thanks for the warm, comforting statement, Bill. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We . . . own the shares on behalf of the members of the funds. We are entitled to ask questions.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies cannot assume that simply because they do not like unions, they can exercise policies of de-unionisation without question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a threat to corporate Australia that, if you want to bid for the trillions of dollars&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XU5">Mr LIEBERMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us just go through it slowly. That was a threat. In the future you want to apply for equity capital or loan funds from the trillions of dollars of superannuation money that will be entrusted into the care of these various funds. If you do and you happen to take the view of no union compulsion in the workplace, for example, Mr Kelty says that companies cannot assume, simply because they do not like unions, they can exercise policies of de-unionisation without question. That can only mean one thing: retaliation. So if you are a union fund and you have trillions of dollars to invest each year, and a company comes along and says, `We have a major infrastructure proposal for Australia requiring loan funds and equity' and it puts it up to the board of this particular superannuation fund, and the company happens to have a freedom of choice policy in that it is not compulsory to belong to a union, Mr Kelty is saying that from his point of view, `We can't ignore that.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very stark, frightening expose of the minds of some of these people who are already in control of very substantial sums of money belonging to ordinary Australians. That is why the debate, in my view, should be broadened to encompass just what sort of corporate governance principles will be allowed to be put in place in Australia in the emerging field of investment of trillions of dollars of Australian workers' money. Are we going to stand by idly and allow people with strong ideological viewpoints&mdash;and they are entitled to have them; I do not object in any way at all to that&mdash;to make the investment decisions for other people's money and to be able to discriminate against investment and growth in Australia because they do not like the non-compulsory union policy, for example, of some players in our economy in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the bulk of Australians would reject wholeheartedly decisions on investment of retirement funds being in the hands of people who will make those sorts of discriminatory judgments. But it is on the record for Mr Kelty to explain what he meant by it. I am very interested in knowing what he meant by it, and obviously the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> is&mdash;that is why it published the article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is that, in all of the changes that have occurred since 1983, very few people with the investment of their hard won investment savings and retirement funds have profited a lot by it. There has been an enormous amount of money made by the commission agents and by the brokers&mdash;and, sure, they have the right to be remunerated for their work. But this government's management of superannuation over the last 13 years has been attended by huge changes, lurches, from one policy to another, all of which have cost the savings of the ordinary worker enormously. I think that is most tragic and something for which this government should be brought to account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing now that it should be entrusted once again with the trillions of dollars that will come from this policy of increased compulsion. In fact, the government is proposing that it should be entrusted to the point where the Prime Minister with his $12 million is virtually saying, `Look, I'll pass the act before I call the election, and I'll implement all this policy after the election.' That has a very familiar ring to the l-a-w that before the last election he put forward so vigorously and then after the election repudiated, without any apology at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I think is lacking in this debate is the squaring up with the self-funded retirees and the people who are already in the work force for whom these proposals will not help at all in any shape or form. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here tonight debating the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1994, which is another government change to superannuation legislation&mdash;one of the myriad of changes introduced by this government, which has created absolute confusion amongst people who want certainty in retirement and who need to be able to make decisions for which they can plan. The government has a fetish with superannuation as being the only acceptable form of saving. Locking up funds with insurance companies seems to be the government's favourite ploy in claiming that it has a real retirement policy. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the decisions of the government over the last 10 or 12 years, one can see that it has fluctuated in its commitment to superannuation. The government says that it is committed to superannuation, but it has failed to take it up strongly even in this budget. For instance, the government, if it really wants employees to contribute to funds, has failed to legislate on behalf of them. The money tree will not exist. It will be working through the award system; it will not be working through legislation here in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not committed. There is a drop-off of around 10 or 12 per cent in the number of people who will be covered by superannuation, who will make a contribution towards their own retirement. The government will play favourites in this matter. For some, the government will say that if you are a member of a union, you will be forced to make a contribution, and if you are not a member of a union, you do not have to put in any money at all. What strange logic. What a queer way of conducting the affairs of this House, if the government has a real policy towards superannuation. I just cannot understand the logic of the way in which the government&mdash;and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in particular&mdash;has approached this whole matter of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made decisions in regard to superannuation as a smokescreen to hide the fact that it has failed to deliver on the tax cuts that were offered at the last federal election. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the last federal election said that all Australians could have what the Liberals had promised: no GST and tax cuts as well. The  tax  cuts have  gone.  He  put  them into l-a-w, law, and nobody received them. As for the goods and services tax: no, we have not got that, but we have a Keating sales tax instead. That tax covers food, commodities and clothing&mdash;all of the dreadful things that the Prime Minister through the election campaign said that the opposition's goods and services tax would pick up. We have, in effect, a goods and services tax; it should be called the Keating sales tax because it covers a wide range of commodities as part of an indirect tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this superannuation proposal in the budget was really to soften the decision the government had taken that it would not deliver on its tax cuts. Instead, the government is proposing some long distance plan of superannuation that is supposed to bring forward the money tree&mdash;and it is supposed to bring great results for all Australians if they water their money tree. If it were in private enterprise, this current government would be up for false advertising in the way it is presenting its money tree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the matter are that what is said on television is far from the truth, and it is nothing short of a political campaign by the government, using taxpayers' money, to ensure its re-election. We have seen this before. We have seen the use of taxpayers' funds in this obnoxious way before. This is self-promotion, advertising of government policies, and using taxpayers funds to do so. We have seen it before, and it is starting again. Here is an information kit on the money tree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister obviously has not read this. The minister is not interested in superannuation.

This is a taxpayer funded self-promotion program for the government, costing $12 1/2 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through some of the details so that it is easy to see why taxpayers of Australia and those who pay superannuation should be most unhappy about the claims of the government. In his speech for the national superannuation education campaign launched on 8 August, the Prime Minister said that someone on average weekly earnings now&mdash;that is, someone on about $32,000 to $33,000&mdash;will retire with a lump sum just under half a million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the community has been sold a pup. Why would anyone want to believe the Prime Minister on any of these matters? He dumped on Australia on the l-a-w, law, tax cuts. He is going to dump on this too. Why should anybody believe that something is going to be delivered by this Prime Minister in the year 2050? For goodness sake, he could not deliver on stuff two years ago; how is he going to deliver on stuff in over 50 years time? It is impossible to even imagine that the Prime Minister cares or believes he is going to be in this parliament, or anywhere in Australia for that matter, to have any influence on superannuation that far ahead in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Treasury's own estimates, to achieve the sum the Prime Minister has used, somebody would have to enter the work force in seven years time at the age of 25, when the government's superannuation scheme is fully implemented. So only such people can achieve the target that the Prime Minister spoke about. They must begin in seven years time at the age of 25. If you are over the age of 25 in seven years time or if you begin work prior to that date and you are now 25, these sums do not add up for you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's sums are not real sums. The very narrow starting point is that a person must be 25 years of age or younger and enter the work force in seven years time. That means that young people now at the age of 18 stand the prospect of this promise coming true. So, in seven years time, in the year 2002, the government's superannuation scheme will be fully implemented, but full-time workers who will have been on average wages for at least 40 years by then just cannot expect to own the Prime Minister's heavily fertilised money tree. There is no way today's workers are going to be able to earn anything like what is suggested in that false advertising that appears each night on television. It is a con&mdash;like everything else the Prime Minister does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians hope and yearn for realism from their Prime Minister, but he constantly lets them down. The promise sounds great, and it is what we really need. We need a savings scheme that has some options but which is not linked as strongly to superannuation as this government is linked; nor should it make the promises that the government or the Prime Minister make. They are false promises; they are misleading promises. I would say that the Prime Minister is practising the deception on the Australian community that he has tried time and time again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You do not believe, Minister, surely that a government can go to the people of Australia and say, `You can have all of this, no GST and tax cuts as well,' and then renege on every part of that promise and say that it is good government. You cannot say that is good government, because the Australian people do not want that. They would prefer to believe you; I acknowledge that. But the fact is that they are so cynically sore and bruised from the pummelling they have had from this government that they will not believe a promise that is coming into fruition in 50 years time and commences in seven&mdash;a promise of a Prime Minister who has broken promise after promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has made a number of assumptions in his estimate of what the superannuation package will be. The assumptions that he made are these: that there will be a steady CPI rate of three per cent over the period, and that is a long time to run a CPI at three per cent; that wages growth will be four per cent&mdash;one per cent above the cost of living&mdash;and that there will be a generous fund earning rate of seven per cent. If there is any variation on any of these figures, the payout of half a million dollars will be inoperable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have so many factors that are improbable, yet the Prime Minister brushes the facts aside and, with some sleight of hand, produces round figures that he expects Australians to believe. They are flawed figures. That money tree is a figment of the Prime Minister's imagination, because a CPI rate of three per cent has not been achieved over the last 10 years. We are looking at the long term here. Superannuation and retirement benefits are in the 20- and 30-year term, and we need funds and investment processes to be able to handle that term and that length of investment. We do not have proper processes in Australia, and we need to have them. But the Prime Minister has assumed that three per cent CPI rate and wages growth of four per cent for that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make an assessment of the earnings of funds, it is very interesting to note how superannuation has worked, and I do not believe that there is any likelihood of change. Let us look at how well superannuation funds have earned interest. As at 30 June 1994&mdash;and these facts were produced by super funds in February 1995&mdash;over a 25-year period there was a real yield of only two per cent. Yet the Prime Minister has based his calculations on seven per cent. Over a 30-year period it was only three per cent, yet he has based it on a seven per cent yield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The margins are so tight&mdash;they are right on the border&mdash;that it is just a figment of the Prime Minister's imagination to expect that his calculations will come through and that after a 30-year period people will receive a payout of half a million dollars. It is not borne out by any facts at all. It is an ad campaign drawn up as part of the re-elect Keating campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that for shorter periods, for 10 or 15 years, there are reasonable yields from superannuation funds. But, for the length of time that the Prime Minister needs&mdash;that is, somebody commencing work at the age of 25, in seven years time, and then working beyond the year 2002 for 40 years from the date of commencement&mdash;a working life of 40 years is nearly finished these days, but we will say that that is achievable&mdash;the yields the Prime Minister claimed cannot be met. If one looks at the effect of changes in real earning rates&mdash;that is, say, a superannuation contribution of 10 per cent of income&mdash;one has to realise that the end benefits, as a multiple of the final salary, can be substantial but their earning rates are as low as two or four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the superannuation funds themselves? Where are they investing to achieve such modest results? The superannuation funds, as of December 1994, were putting about 15 per cent of their money overseas, about 14 per cent into short-term and liquid assets, about 21 per cent into fixed interest rates, 37 per cent into equities and units in trusts, and about nine per cent into land, buildings and non-financial assets. So they are basically playing the money market, and a lot of the superannuation funds of Australians are being invested overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this whole process should sound the warning alarms for any Australians. We need to get superannuation right; I am not denying that. The government has fiddled and played with superannuation as its sole cause and its sole attraction for people seeking retirement. Once you start to criticise the government, the Prime Minister flies into a rage and starts to deal with people, as he did with the business community before the last election, making the sorts of comments that caused Dick Warburton to say that we have been getting much closer to the politics of hate&mdash;in other words, `If you don't agree with me, I'll not only hate you but I'll destroy you.' Those are the comments that the Prime Minister makes. We should look at the Business Council of Australia and some of the treatment it has had. CRA chief executive John Ralph agreed that serving on two coalition committees brought the threat of penalties against his organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister cannot adopt these processes. He can lead by example and accurate information, but to slag people and abuse them because they disagree with the hyperbole of his  retirement program is unrealistic. The facts do not stack up. They cannot be achieved. The narrow gateway of entry for superannuants in seven years time and the Prime Minister's predictions of the package which assumes a CPI growth rate of three per cent, a wages growth of four per cent and a fund earning of seven per cent cannot be realised over a 20- to 30-year period, which is the period that is essential for the Prime Minister's package to be realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the thing that really hurts most people is the fact that between now and the year 2002 the retirees who would otherwise have had the benefit of income tax cuts which were to start on 1 January this year will not receive the full benefit of the government's superannuation promises and will remain largely dependent on the age pension. That is a promise that anybody over the age of 40 can just forget. This is not a commitment for the over-40s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the under-40s, you have to believe that the Prime Minister will deliver something in 50 years, when he is living in Switzerland, France or somewhere else and not giving a continental about Australia. Why should we believe Keating on this issue? He will not even be around to see that these things come into place. He will wobble out from some retirement hole, with the press there, and say, `The current government has let me down. I planned superannuation to survive and give a real return of half a million dollars in 40 years time.' He will not be in Australia; he will be gone. He will be out of it because he thinks this place is the backside of the earth, and he has said that and he has written that. We need to be realistic about what the Prime Minister has in mind for the workers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No worker in their 40s on average weekly earnings has got a chance under the compulsory superannuation scheme. For self-funded retirees, there is nothing. For those who have worked and saved and scrimped, there is nothing. Forget them and write them off. Many women will not benefit by this process because a great proportion of women do not earn average weekly wages and the Prime Minister's commitment and that money tree are based on average weekly wages. That is the con of the whole thing. There are many people on lower incomes who will not achieve that amount. If they are over 40 there is nothing for them at all. If they are over the age of 25 in seven years time, they will not get the half a million dollars anyway. The con for workers is realistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Accord Mark VIII a worker on the lowest award rate who received the accord safety net pay increases but makes employee superannuation contributions in 1998 will be $8.25 a week worse off in real terms. Where is this going? We have a problem that the Prime Minister does not talk about. Current workers are paying for unemployment benefits, they are paying for retirement benefits for those who are currently retired and they are contributing towards their own superannuation as well. This is the dilemma that the Prime Minister will not confront. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill that we are dealing with here today is relatively minor, but it opens up the entire issue related to the government's policy on superannuation. Over a long period the issue of compulsory superannuation has been discussed and has been the subject of numerous reports. People try to say that during the Fraser and previous governments the matter was considered and abandoned and that that is some form of criticism. The simple fact is that it was abandoned because it did not seem to produce the benefits that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) now seeks to give it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and everybody else who supports this system does so on the basis that Australia has to do something about its abysmal savings record and its substantial overseas debt. That debt represents a significant risk to Australia, even in terms of our independence. I quote frequently Hartcher, the Japanese correspondent for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> who&mdash;I think it was on 8 or 11 November 1994&mdash;reported in that paper how during the trade negotiations between Japan and America a very senior Japanese official threatened people, including Lloyd Bentsen, the then Treasury secretary, that if America was not prepared to pull back from its attitude on trade negotiations, Japan would encourage its financial institutions to withdraw their money out of America. The interview quotes the person who told this story to the journalist. The journalist said to this fellow Koo, from Nomura Securities, after this threat had been made to the Americans, `What did the Americans say?' The answer was, `Nothing.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a country of the financial power of Japan is prepared to make that sort of threat against a country of the financial power of the United States, one might wonder if at some time in the future, for whatever reason, a particular country in the world, holding a large amount of Australian paper, which it could simply acquire, were to require something of Australia that the government of the day was not anxious to provide, how quickly our government could be brought to heel in terms of threats of that nature. When one has to start worrying about whether our so-called head of state is a person living in England, I would find the threat to our independence much more concerning in regard to our established debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another piece of wonderful childish folklore that is constantly published on this particular issue by our Prime Minister&mdash;that is, that you cannot blame this federal government in any way for the terms of our overseas indebtedness; that is all achieved by the nasty private sector and its irrational behaviour. The Prime Minister quite rightly points out that in this regard the federal government owes practically no money overseas. That is absolutely true. Over many decades federal governments have only gone to the foreign money markets when our balance of payments or our holdings of a particular currency&mdash;be it yen or something else&mdash;at the Reserve Bank were not sufficient to finance our activities and as a consequence have raised a bond issue in that currency to get our foreign currency levels back into balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Otherwise, why would a federal government, even ahead of a state or local government, bother to borrow on international markets with all the associated risks when it has first call on the national savings of Australians? Contrary to popular opinion, whilst our savings levels are low, they are not nil. The simple fact is that governments have first call on those for various reasons&mdash;namely, that they appear to offer the best form of security. As is the current case in the federal government's accumulated debt, if you have the federal government sucking about $100 billion out of the domestic savings pool, it is pretty obvious that those wishing to advance their business through borrowings might find themselves going offshore to borrow their money for the simple reason that there is none left in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we start to moralise on the level of Australian savings, we find there is an obligation on a government that owes $100,000 million and is paying $10.077 billion in interest, according to the budget this year. Public debt interest is listed, I think, at $10.077 billion. That exceeds defence. That amount of money is having a severe effect on our overseas indebtedness. I think it is reasonable to argue that, notwithstanding the impossibility of the circumstances, if the government were to pay back its $100,000 million in debt tomorrow, Australia's overseas debt would fall by $100,000 million. That is a simplistic presentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, any government that stands up, sticks out its chest like a great big kid and says&mdash;and I have heard both the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) and the Prime Minister make this claim&mdash;`We don't owe any money overseas. Don't blame us for the overseas debt,' is being foolish and childish and demonstrates absolutely no understanding of the fundamental economic issue that, if you have a major borrower in your domestic market, in the end they will drive less powerful borrowers offshore. The first issue when we consider this process of forcing Australian individuals to save is that there is a substantial responsibility on government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made the point time and again that the fundamental of Keynesian economic theory was that governments borrowed in recession at extremely cheap interest rates, which usually followed that situation, to restart the economy. When the policy was first proposed, politicians of that era found it imperative that they also invest in infrastructure. Roosevelt built the great Boulder Dam, et cetera. Today we tend to borrow the money and pay it out to people to do nothing, and that is not very smart. That is just another aspect of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been accepted that governments would borrow in bad times. But the other side of that theory was that, as the effect of that borrowing and spending became apparent, it was time for government to get out of the borrowing field and start to run surplus budgets to repay the debts of bad times and gain the revenue from the increased private sector activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has not happened in recent years. The trouble is that too many people have been put on one gravy train or another during the recession, some are not too anxious to leave and a government that is purely focused on seeking votes turns around and accommodates them with borrowed money. Last year, as records and the budget papers show, borrowings in what was probably the five minutes of economic sunshine was $12 billion. If we readjust the figures for this year, as the Australian Bureau of Statistics has, with regard to assets we find the net effect is that the government is borrowing some $8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Isn't it amazing&mdash;we have got back a little bit of money on our foreign debt because we sold to foreigners over 50 per cent of Qantas in the Qantas float&mdash;more than we were promised. The simple fact is that all of the money that came out of Australia&mdash;$750 million or something like that&mdash;came out of someone's savings account, came out of their resources, or they borrowed to make the purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In every one of those cases, the sale of an asset like Qantas or for that matter the Commonwealth Bank within the domestic situation in Australia clearly does not improve national savings. It is just a matter of simple arithmetic. It appears the Prime Minister does not understand that. The first factor is that, if all this superannuation deal is to do with improving national savings, we are squeezing dollars out of individuals when the government of the day could make a genuine contribution if it looked to its own activities and followed accepted economic principles and just did not borrow&mdash;be it good times or bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate then goes to what we are doing to people. It then goes to process. I find the process amazing because we still do not have a proper response to how people might benefit from their superannuation by giving them a clear and unambiguous opportunity to invest in a single policy throughout their working life. It is fine for someone who, as the Prime Minister envisages, just happens to turn 25 in the year 2002, or whatever it is, and just happens to be earning average weekly earnings. Not too many people who vote Labor earn average weekly earnings&mdash;$33,000 to $34,000 a year. My family runs businesses and employs some 30 to 40 people. Very few of those, as hard working as they are, earn anything like that sort of money. A top wage for sub-managers is about $25,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the first assumption of the Prime Minister's calculation is that you have all these people on $33,000 to $34,000 a year. I have usually found, although I have not checked recent statistics, that the number of people who earn average weekly earnings or better are in only the top 10 per cent of taxpayers. All the rest earn substantially less. Many earn less than $20,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is out there painting this picture of almost half a million in returns. We know the conditions by which that might be achieved, including all the protections about inflation and wage rises. What is it&mdash;three per cent inflation and four per cent wage increases? Not too many people around the world are experiencing that sort of situation. To suggest that that will apply for 40 years, commencing in 2002, is a pretty optimistic situation and quite simply one the Prime Minister will not be answerable for. So we have the issue of the process and where it is leading in terms of its ability to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have in relation to the issue of process whether superannuation in isolation should be the sole means of generating savings or generating people's retirement income. Superannuation and managed funds typically and traditionally have invested in very large enterprises, particularly blue chip. You cannot blame them for that. The simple fact is that those people are charged with protecting the public's money. When one has that responsibility, one generally tries to invest very cautiously. The more cautious your investment, the less your return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years in recent times inflation looked after that. Asset values in nominal monetary terms grew dramatically, and these companies could declare big profits. That has ceased. The Prime Minister again tells us how wonderful it is that he has low inflation, but he also has low asset growth and low growth on people's investments&mdash;ask any typical self-funded retiree who has been devastated by this process. The simple fact is that the fund managers found the ease with which they could declare substantial returns became extremely difficult and they next found themselves obliged to go out and gamble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not give you a full run-down on derivatives, but derivatives are just another form of bookmaking unless you retain it as it was originally intended: for people in trade to take a position that allowed them to meet a contract or repayment, or do something. One would still be a winner and one would still be a loser but they both achieved their aim of fixing either a price for the goods they were selling or a price for the goods they were buying at some time in the future, which allowed them to meet other contractual arrangements, be it repayment of debt or meeting a contract to provide goods. That was quite proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the money managers stepped into the market and tried to second-guess people in those trades, anything was possible. We saw it with the Leeson case. We have seen it here in Australia where, in dealing on the bond market in that particular regard in what is basically a fairly artificial proposal, huge losses were sustained. People have been getting letters in the mail. People I know are being told that the value of their accumulated superannuation in recent years has not gone up. It has in fact gone down because people made mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only certainty of moving outside of those very secure investments is that there is always a loser for wherever there is a winner. And that is what the Prime Minister is telling Australians. We see these little cartoon advertisements back on with people pouring these coins into little flowerpots. I understood we were going to have a $12.5 million campaign so that people might understand how the system works and why it is good for Australia. We get a cartoon that, after you have turned five, would not be of great interest. But it is also very misleading because, as I have said, it predicts all these wonderful results in cartoon form when in fact the experts&mdash;and there are now a legion&mdash;are raising some fair questions about it. I find this as something that is a grave problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now taken another step. The Prime Minister had to duck out of his l-a-w tax cut promises and he had to put something forward that looked like he was not ducking out of his tax cut promises&mdash;some sort of a con trick, if you like. The simple fact was that he said, `I'm not going to give you your tax cuts, but I'm going to give you something much, much better: I'm going to put some money into superannuation so in 50 years time you can get the benefit of that tax cut you did not get.' I have to tell him, in political terms, that that will be very unconvincing. I think the Treasury estimate is that by the year 2002 some government has to find something like $4.5 billion for the government's contribution to this program, compared with something like a $1.8 billion tax cut. In fact, the government contribution could be in the order of $10 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find all of this very worrying, because the other point I always like to make in this particular debate is the fundamental issue of this super investment strategy. I have mentioned the aspect of how they so frequently invest in very large enterprises. They also invest substantially offshore. I read the other day that AMP, one of the better-known fund managers and longstanding vendor of superannuation in its various forms, had a dreadful time at home and, if it were not for its offshore investment in Pearl insurance in the United Kingdom, it would have had some very sad news for its policyholders in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, now we find major funds taking 15 and 25 per cent of their funds offshore. This is one of my major complaints, with a small business background. When the employees of a small business employer put their savings into a bank, there was a fair chance that the small business employer could go and borrow some money at the bank and probably expand his or her operation and create more jobs and more savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when all this money is forced to be diverted into superannuation funds&mdash;and as you start to take three per cent of the wages of people, as you propose in the next couple of years&mdash;they will see that money as the money they would have otherwise saved. They will refuse to save it, because they will say, `The government is looking after that.' The end result is that their employer will have a further narrowing of borrowing options through the bank and if he goes around to the superannuation fund he will be laughed out the door. They would say, `How many hundred million did you say you wanted?' when he wants $100,000. They are not geared to handle that sort of business as the banks are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government missed a great opportunity to allow people to open prescribed deposits instead of their own response to multiple funds for workers such as shearers and other seasonal and part-time workers. Some of this money needs to go into the banks. It is more tragic when you think that these small business people I am putting the case for are the ones who are forced to pay money into these accounts and, when they need it to expand their business, they cannot even go and borrow that money back&mdash;it is not available to them. It is just silly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, when you set out to generate investment within your country, the first thing you have to be able to do is have some flexibility. It is quite obvious that a good retirement income policy would give individual Australians a number of options&mdash;not just the one that Bill Kelty liked because he felt there was an opportunity to pick up some revenue for the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family home, as the Singaporeans have recognised, is a component of a viable retirement situation and I think there should be, as part of a program, the opportunity for people for a period to claim tax deductions for investing in their home. I think they should be able to invest in the bricks and mortar component of their own small business. That is quite practical if you keep to those sorts of assets because the tax man can put a caveat on it to see that that money is preserved if there is a sale of the property. But all of these things are quite complex. The simple fact is that the government has not succeeded. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to record the grief of Adelaide's Jewish community and my own distress over the desecration of Jewish graves in Adelaide last month. On Friday, 7 July, 62 graves in the Jewish section of the West Terrace Cemetery in the city were attacked. Some graves were so badly damaged that the names of the people that they commemorated were unreadable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jewish section of the West Terrace Cemetery has a history as old as South Australia itself. The first Jewish settlers arrived in 1836, the year of Adelaide's foundation, and the first Jewish burial took place at West Terrace in 1843. Several prominent members of the South Australian Jewish community are buried at West Terrace. The grave of Sir Lewis Cohen, Lord Mayor of Adelaide from 1889 to 1901, was amongst those damaged. Other vandalised graves included those of a stillborn baby girl and a one-day-old boy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The desecration of the graves was not an act of random vandalism. Instead, the evidence suggests that it was carried out by an organised group consisting of at least three teams of two people each. Somewhere in Adelaide there are well-organised anti-Semites prepared to carry out such a cowardly and contemptible act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adelaide has a small Jewish community, with around only 2,000 members. Some of its facilities, including a school and a synagogue, are located in my electorate of Sturt. Earlier this year I was shocked to receive a copy of answering machine messages to the synagogue. I hate to have to repeat it, but I will put it into the record. One went:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now instead of Good Friday we should be celebrating Gas Friday. We take great pleasure in the fact that your ancestors sat in this chamber with their arms blowing up, with their legs shrivelling, with fat dripping from their bodies, with Adolf sitting in his chair saying, `Wa, wa, look at the Yid.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And this is one of the milder messages. Also disturbing was a message from the National Action organisation in which they warned `that the Jewish community will become a political target of National Action'. I do not make any allegation that either the obscene message or the desecration of the graves was committed by National Action, who have denied involvement in both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, despite this, there is no doubt that someone is conducting a campaign of persecution and harassment against Adelaide's Jewish community. Jewish homes and businesses are being vandalised or daubed with swastikas and slogans. Members of the community who have publicly aired these problems have had rocks thrown through their windows. An elderly Holocaust survivor who told her tale on ABC television anonymously has been tracked down and subjected to threats and harassment. If these events occurred in Germany or in Poland they would be national crimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the Jewish community was not immediately notified by the police about the vandalism. The South Australian police appeared to have been unable to adequately deal with this problem and there are no leads in this case. The Adelaide attacks have not gone unnoticed in the international community. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin described them as an `ugly, dastardly deed which is the violation of every civilised law'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fortnight after the attack, over 1,000 people&mdash;including politicians, leaders from all faiths and members from ethnic groups as diverse as the Shi'ite Muslims and Ukrainians&mdash;attended a memorial service at West Terrace Cemetery. Premier Dean Brown spoke for all South Australians when he said, `I join with you at this time of mourning.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Norman Schueler, President of the Jewish Community Council of South Australia, told the meeting that South Australians must work together to prevent such mindless acts. He said, `We must not allow a detestable few to unravel the fabric of Australian society.' He also spoke of the tremendous support that the Jewish community has received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Restoration of the graves began last week. The state, federal and local governments have contributed $15,000 each towards the graves' repair, and members of the public have offered their expertise or donated money.

This book is a statement of unclaimed moneys. Under the Banking Act 1959, the contents of bank accounts that have not been used in seven years with balances over $500 are transferred in trust to Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In previous years, the names, addresses and amounts were published in the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, but this did not attract very much attention, so Treasury released a statement in a book format. Apart from my office making an effort to write to all people of Leichhardt in the book, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> also cooperated by publishing a list of names, and it even tracked down the owners of some of the larger bank accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article sparked a huge amount of interest in Cairns. Behind each name in the book is a different story, covering the spectrum of life's experiences. My office had a phone call from a man who had opened up a bank account into which employers could deposit his wages. Several jobs later, he had forgotten the bank account. One couple had several phone calls from people who had seen their daughter's name in the newspaper list, long after she had moved interstate. Another woman's daughter had died and she was trying to locate her bank accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> also found a woman, now living in a nursing home, who had unfortunately forgotten her bank account, and a man who had never known his deceased wife had been saving for a rainy day until the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> contacted him. It certainly was an interesting exercise. I simply thought it was a chance to let people know how they could claim their money and a chance to prod a few memories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this exercise stirred up some other problems. I was inundated with phone calls from people who had received letters from so-called money finders, who vaguely alluded to lost or bequeathed money and offered to retrieve this money for a fee of up to 15 or 20 per cent. What these organisations are doing is not illegal, but the information is freely available by buying the statement of unclaimed funds. But these letters are deliberately vague and certainly neglect to mention that people are able to claim the money themselves without paying any fee. They exploit those who think there is no other way to retrieve lost money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem is that many of the banks seem to have failed to write to any of these people before closing their accounts. I can understand the banks having problems tracing people, particularly if they have moved, but many of these people who have contacted my office have been living at the same address for the last 20 years and still have accounts with the same bank. I cannot think of any reason why the banks cannot check open bank accounts and send out a letter, at least, before transferring the contents to Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advice in relation to the Banking Act is that there is no legal requirement for the banks to write to their customers, but the banks should have the common courtesy and sense of duty that would compel them to write to all customers before transferring the contents of their accounts that have not been used in seven years. We are not talking about trifling amounts. The largest amount listed in this year's statement was over $400,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally agree with the statements that were made by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh), the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) on the adjournment last week about the excessive fees that banks are charging. But we should also look at the basic customer service. I cannot see why banks cannot perform the simple service of writing to people before transferring their bank accounts to Treasury. I hope to see this happening in the future. </PARA>

I did not have the occasion to meet Fred personally but knew of him through his political life, his good works and his love of Canberra&mdash;in that, he was rare, for it is very rare indeed to find a federal politician who expresses a love for Canberra. The people of Canberra returned this feeling of goodwill by making Fred the King of Canberra, a duty in which he revelled.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, his contribution to ACT tourism was great. His good friend from ACT Tourism, David Marshall, asked that I pass on that Mr Daly's contribution to tourism and the image of Canberra was fantastic. In particular, he developed the political discovery tour map and the Murrays coach political tour. Both exercises provided tremendous insight into the intriguing world of politics in the nation's capital. He was a great contributor to the tourist infrastructure in the ACT and gave it a new dimension. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday, 16 August, seeking information from the Department of Human Services and Health on behalf of a church welfare agency&mdash;which was urgently awaiting its emergency relief grant&mdash;my staff and I had the distinct impression that we were being given the run-around. My staff were given information that there had been some delay in getting the July payments out but that the cheques were in the mail. There was a reluctance to discuss detail with my staffer, who said that he felt the information was being deliberately withheld.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Thursday, 17 August, I rang the department myself and received a number of evasive answers. I pointed out that there was a press release already in the marketplace and that, therefore, it was public information. In fact, that morning a journalist had sent me a copy of the duty senator's press release, dated 15 August, which I understand was received in the newsroom at around 8.00 a.m. on 17 August, two days after the release was prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was told it would take some time to get the information together for my electorate, despite the fact that areas of my electorate had media releases, in the name of the duty senator, already being sent to them in quite comprehensive and detailed form. When I said, in exasperation, that I had welfare agencies that had approached me for information, I was asked, `Why didn't you refer them to me?'&mdash;`me' being a departmental officer concerned. In other words, the information had been in the marketplace&mdash;the duty senator had it, some media had it and the department would answer individual inquiries from potential recipients&mdash;but the elected representative had this important information concerning church and welfare agencies deliberately withheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked the blunt question, `Was the officer under instruction not to provide coalition members with the information?', I received the reply `No, but there is an embargo.' `Embargo'&mdash;what is that, other than a deliberate withholding of information?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I expressed my dismay, I was told that I should not be too upset and `I think yours'&mdash;that is, the embargo&mdash;`is lifted at lunchtime today; some are kept on for two weeks.' This is an admission from the department&mdash;` for two weeks'. Despite this, I still did not receive the information until after 4 p.m. that day&mdash;presumably by which time the electronic media would have lost interest in my response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time I have experienced this treatment. It has happened in relation to an aged care grant. On that occasion, the information was in the marketplace but I was told that I could get the data from the ALP duty senator. On that occasion his staff were cagey&mdash;obviously not sure whether the local media had used his release. Again, I objected and was told by the department, `That's the way it works.' When I asked how we might get around this I was told, `How you know the big dark secrets, I wouldn't know'&mdash;in other words, the surrender of professionalism to subservience and outright bias by the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this current instance my protest is twofold. I object to the withholding of information on cheques&mdash;already some six weeks late&mdash;when three charity agencies were totally out of emergency funds and were dipping into other scarce resources to keep the organisation going. I object to organisations like the Salvation Army, Lifeline, women's crisis centres, Aboriginal housing cooperatives and teams of voluntary people being used in such a shabby and manipulative way just to suit the government's grubby political agenda, scoring cheap points and using, if not exacerbating, human misery to achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it staggers me that officers of the Department of Human Services and Health have become so imbued with the party political processes of the government that they think it is the right thing to do to deliberately withhold legitimate information from elected members. No doubt some officers do this unwittingly, others unwillingly; nonetheless it happens. It shows that the infamous guideline in the department's October 1993 handbook&mdash;I refer you to the Senate estimates on this matter&mdash;that says, `Under no circumstance should advice letters to opposition MPs be prepared' is still alive and well under Minister Carmen Lawrence. In fact, it is worse&mdash;departmental officers are instructed or induced to withhold legitimate information already in the marketplace from elected members of parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is nothing short of a perversion of the political process and I object to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now eight months since the report into the Child Support Agency was released, in December 1994. In that time, many thousands of people throughout Australia have raised serious concerns about the Child Support Agency, but not much has changed. Most of us would know that the CSA is one of the most contentious and problematic government agencies, ruled by flawed legislation. I meet with a steady flow of constituents most weeks who believe that the Child Support Agency is a major problem in their lives. Most of all, constituents are angry about the federal government's tardy response to the inquiry into the CSA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people held out hope that the inquiry into the CSA would change things. They believed the CSA would be sorted out, client service would improve, payments would be made on time and payment requirements would not be so harsh. Instead, they are seeing a too tardy response from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tabled an interim response in March this year, four months after the original inquiry report was tabled. The government stated that the inquiry report had raised many `sensitive issues' which also had `budgetary implications' and that it needed to `seek expert advice, both legal and technical'. The government estimates that it will not have a final response to the CSA report until the first half of 1996, over a year from the tabling of the original report. In the meantime thousands of Child Support Agency clients have to wait for improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are at least five main issues of concern about the CSA which people bring to my attention. There is the fact that the child maintenance formula takes very little account of non-custodial parents beginning new lives, and that is becoming an issue of increasing concern. Another issue of concern is that child maintenance levels are too high and discourage non-custodial parents from working at all. Regularly, I have people in the office telling me that they are just going to disappear out of the system. The CSA cannot ensure that the payments are made on time. In one case, one of my constituents was owed $4,000 by her ex-partner. While she was earning $23,000, he was earning more than $50,000. By the time the CSA caught up with him, he had declared that he was only earning $8,000 and the CSA wrote off the debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next concern is the fact that the CSA is located in the taxation department, has very little concern about anything the clients are going through and is merely focused on the dollars. The last concern I have here is the location of the CSA in metropolitan areas. People living in my electorate of Grey would appreciate the opportunity to discuss their cases face to face with CSA staff. But, instead, they queue on the telecentre answering line. If they are lucky, the waiting time may be only half an hour&mdash;half an hour too long. That is a system we know does need looking at in a number of other government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, from the point of view of most parents&mdash;custodial and non-custodial, male and female&mdash;the CSA is not delivering the service it was established to deliver. The CSA and the legislation it enforces are causing frustration, anger and hurt in the community. While they continue to do so, we must continue to remind the government that the job has not been finished. People want the CSA to change, they want the CSA to work and they want it to work fairly. They want the federal government to act now and not in another year's time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions in this House I have had cause to criticise the actions of state governments. I guess I do not really have a terribly high opinion of a lot of state governments around Australia. But tonight I am in the not so pleasant position of having to criticise a state Labor government&mdash;that being, of course, the New South Wales government&mdash;and its recent decision to abandon its promise to lift the tolls on the M4 and M5 motorways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of this House will recall, it was the Fahey coalition government that introduced these unfair and inequitable tolls on the M4 and the M5, despite the fact that the federal government over time has provided plenty of funds to the New South Wales government to provide for first-class major highways. It was a fairly dishonest move at the time by the then conservative government to shift those funds into another part of Sydney to fix up another problem on the North Shore, while deciding that it, therefore, had to raise money through private means to fund what is a very good road&mdash;although a half-finished road&mdash;now called the M5. It made it a tollway, which means that the people of south-western Sydney&mdash;and, for that matter, western Sydney with the M4&mdash;have to pay for the privilege of driving to Sydney, whereas people on the North Shore these days do not. It was a disgraceful decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party&mdash;not just before the state election, but for almost four years before&mdash;promised, quite rightly, to remove those tolls. Indeed, I can recall significant protests occurring when the tollgates were first put in near Moorebank on the M5. The former mayor of Liverpool, now the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), was, quite rightly, at the forefront of those protests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do we find now? The state Labor Party under Bob Carr won the state election by one seat on the basis of a number of things, including the unequivocal, fairly clear and fundamental promise to lift the tolls on the M4 and M5. Now we find that they have not done that, that they find it a bit difficult and that all sorts of excuses are being made, particularly by the minister responsible, Michael Knight, for why they cannot lift the toll. They say they are sorry. I do not think that is good enough. I think people are getting a bit tired of the cynicism of people elected on a specific promise. We have seen it before on the other side of politics, but now we are seeing it, unfortunately, on this side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a federal member for a seat that is affected by this, I know that a lot of my constituents, Labor Party branch members and party voters&mdash;I mean genuine Labor Party branch members, not the people who have been stacked into the party and who have never voted Labor in their lives around my area&mdash;are very concerned about the fact that the state Labor government that they worked so hard to elect has gone back on this fairly fundamental promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning that Bob Carr is going out to the electorate of Badgerys Creek to open an electorate office for the local member there, Diane Beamer. I hope that on Wednesday, Bob Carr takes the opportunity to announce, following public pressure&mdash;there has been a lot of it&mdash;that he will lift the tolls. That was a fundamental promise. The tolls are an unfair burden on the working class families in western and south-western Sydney. I think it is appropriate that those tolls be lifted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I issued a press release some six weeks ago about this matter. I was also on ABC radio talking about the need for this promise to be kept. I was attacked by the minister, Michael Knight, who accused me of being motivated by sour grapes because I lost federal preselection. What a pathetic response from a minister responsible for such an important thing!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Knight should be aware that the preselection is over. One thing that is not over is the toll on the M5 and M4. Obviously, I would have preferred to have been the Labor Party candidate for the next election, but I still want the Labor Party to win seats in western and south-western Sydney. It is making it very difficult for this government, with all the talk about honesty in politics, when a state Labor government breaks a fundamental promise that affects people in their everyday lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Mr Knight, Bob Carr and the whole state Labor government: think again. I hope the Olympic Games are not stuffed up the way this has been stuffed up. I urge the state government to respond, to look after its voters and to lift those tolls. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, clearly, the Labor governments in New South Wales and Queensland have one thing in common, and that is that word `tollway'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This evening I want to talk very briefly about an aeroplane. It will come as no surprise to a number of my colleagues in this place that this is not the first, second or third occasion on which I have spoken about this particular aeroplane. I have lost count of the number of occasions on which I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer, of course, to the Australian designed and built Nomad aircraft, about 180 of which were built at the old Government Aircraft Factories, now Aerospace Technologies of Australia, over the last 20 years. A large proportion of those aircraft are still in service in Australia in military guise and on the civil register and are also overseas, in both military situations and on the civil register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I want to remind the House of a crash in March 1990 in which a young RAAF flight lieutenant was killed near Edinburgh. His widow and her parents, his brother and his brother-in-law have been in touch with me constantly since March of 1990, so we are looking at something that has gone on over five years, and for many that is too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to mention is the continual sloping of shoulders&mdash;if that is the right terminology&mdash;of ministers. Ministers, in particular defence ministers, have continued to abrogate their responsibilities in relation to that aircraft. I hope that we will shortly come to the point where the present Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) announces that those aircraft are to be retired from service in the Australian Defence Force. I will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention negligence. I refer to negligence on the part of the Australian Defence Force, and the air force in particular&mdash;which is being brought out in fairly large measure by the ongoing Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee which is hearing at the moment about the circumstances of that fatal crash in 1990&mdash;and negligence on the part of Aerospace Technologies of Australia which, I understand, has given very poor evidence to that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to refer to the Ombudsman's 1994 report of that particular crash which was the result of a reference by the Minister for Defence on 25 November 1991. It took a long time to get to the Ombudsman; it took a long time for the Ombudsman to report on the matter. The issue continues to bounce around in terms of an incomplete response to the relatives. That leads me to another point, and that is the persistence of those relatives. I pay tribute to those relatives tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Therefore, it comes as no surprise to find that the Defence Force grounded those aircraft in November last year. The previous Chief of the General Staff, prior to his retirement in July, recommended to the minister that they be retired from service. I only hope that Senator Ray will take up that advice&mdash;as he indicated he would several weeks ago&mdash;and announce that those aircraft, the so-called `widow makers', will be retired from the Australian Defence Force in the very near future. I also hope that Minister Brereton will take appropriate action corresponding to that taken by the Minister for Defence in terms of those Nomad aircraft on the civil register. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk about a group of young Australians who have won international and national acclaim because of their incredible talent, their hard work and their tenacity. Of course, I am talking about the kids involved with the Flying Fruit Fly Circus. They have been aptly described by Tony Wright of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, who has had a long-term interest in the circus since it first developed in Albury-Wodonga many years ago, as `ordinary kids doing extraordinary things'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Flying Fruit Fly Circus is doing an extraordinary thing at the moment: its supporters are circulating lizards to all federal members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The idea of the lizard is to draw to the attention of members of parliament from all sides the plight that the children in the circus find themselves in. That is because the federal government has, despite two or three years of intense effort by the circus, failed to resolve the funding problems of the circus. In fact, the government has subjected the circus to not one, not two, but now three separate inquiries as to the basis on which its funding should be developed for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that two major reports were done at Commonwealth request in the last three or four years, both of those reports recommending that the Commonwealth provide funds to enable both the circus and the training part to continue. Yet those reports appear to have been substantially ignored. When media attention began to focus earlier this year on the circus's plight, the government commissioned another study. I might say that the circus has no objection at all to another study. But the problem is when does this end and, in the meantime, the circus's reserves are being depleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I think the circus performed to 300,000 people in Australia, which is more than the Australian Opera and the Australian Ballet together. Incidentally, while they got $7 million worth of taxpayers' money, these kids got $150,000 or thereabouts&mdash;I am a bit rusty on that figure but it is in that area. I do not think those children in the circus are being treated properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that all members when they get their lizard take the trouble to ask the minister for the arts what on earth the government is doing, why can it not resolve the issue and why can it not be honest with these kids. If there is something that the government does not want to do&mdash;that is, if the government does not want to fund the circus because it does not have the aura of the opera or the ballet&mdash;then it should come out and tell the truth. In my view, the Commonwealth should fund them so that the Flying Fruit Fly Circus can continue to be the treasure of Australia's circus performing children and an organisation which continues to gain increasing international recognition and acclaim. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Federal Government estimated that the cost of subsidy for interferon alfa-2b for use in the treatment of Hepatitis C would be approximately $5.6m in 1994/95.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The Federal Government is committed to monitoring and reviewing the usage of interferon alfa for the treatment of Hepatitis C. Access may be possible in the future for a larger patient population if the impending review recommends a broadening of the usage criteria. This will lessen the cost considerably for patients who may not currently qualify for subsidy. There are no plans to further reduce the cost to patients who currently receive subsidy under this program as the cost to these patients is consistent to those applying elsewhere in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</PARA>
