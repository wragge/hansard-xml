<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was attracted to an article which appeared in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 2 May 1995. The headline read `The rains to end the heart-breaker drought'. I can attest that it has not broken the drought in central Victoria. It has rained water, but it has not rained any money. The farmers in my area will have no income for at least nine months. They are now at the stage of trying to put in a crop. It is costing them between $20,000 and $25,000 for fuel, for superphosphate and for the time and effort spent putting that crop in. It will be at least nine months before they receive any income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern about this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> was that it raised speculation that the federal government would not provide any drought assistance to the area of central and northern Victoria.

Eighty-nine schools have been sold and closed, and $127 million has been raised by the Kennett government from the sale of those schools.

A one per cent increase on an average mortgage in my electorate will add a further $80 per month to the mortgage of young families.

This is an example of how various departments of this government are working together in very intelligent ways to create employment and to promote tourism. The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) understands that tourism is a major growth industry in this area, and it is certainly being promoted in a most sensible way by this government and creating jobs while doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it fascinating that the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) would be concerned about the way that the current Victorian government is working. I think he has a case of Alzheimer's disease, frankly. He really needs to look at the similarities between this government and the Cain-Kirner government of Victoria he seemed to talk so loudly about. Some people may remember the state Treasurer in Victoria writing the letter in support of the Pyramid Building Society. There are some similarities between that and the letter that has gone out in the prospectus from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and between the selling off of the trains and other assets in Victoria and the selling off of Comcar.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to turn the mood of the chamber from the aggression and humour we have just had to a more sober subject. This morning I would like to grieve about the state of the administration of family law in Australia, which, frankly, is approaching proportions of a modern horror story. The subject of family law&mdash;and I am not just talking about the Family Court and the Child Support Agency; they are part of the overall story&mdash;is something that is touching an increasing number of people in our community today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week or so it has perhaps been given a particular prominence through a dispute, carried on through the media, between the head of the Family Court, Justice Nicholson, and the chair of the parliamentary committee conducting a review into family law, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). Whilst I do not agree with every comment the member for Chifley made in a recent speech, I have some sympathy, as many members in this place will have, with his clear frustration at the administration of the Family Court and the fact that, quite manifestly, in the view of many of us, it is not functioning very effectively. I would also have to say to him that, as the chair of a committee currently conducting an inquiry, it was probably somewhat imprudent of him to make those views on the public record at this particular point in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting, however, to see the response of Justice Nicholson. He got very heated and upset about those remarks. I have noticed on previous occasions, when people had the unmitigated gall in a democracy to actually question the operation of the Family Court, that Justice Nicholson frequently gets very upset and disputes other people's rights to make any comment, constructive or otherwise; but he, himself, is quite happy to enter into the public debate. I would suggest to him that if he wants to enter into the public debate he must expect some robust responses from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that for most people who come into contact with family law in this country, in one form or another, there are very few at an operating level who would have a view other than that it is a mess.  What is not in dispute is that the Family Law Act and the Family Court do not really operate in an effective way and the Child Support Agency continues to be an absolute shambles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think government administration is lacking here. It is a major area that affects a lot of people. I think the government has some responsibility to start doing something about the situation. The slowness of government to move; the slowness of government to respond to reports; the slowness of government to bring forward meaningful legislation, I believe, is doing lasting damage to our community. The costs for the individual man or woman who comes into contact with the family law system in this country are considerable. The grief and personal upset for not only adults but also children are, I believe, unacceptable. The delays are often horrendous and quite frequently we actually see injustices done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that as a member of parliament, as with all members, I would spend a lot of time with constituents on issues affecting the family law system in this country. I have also been through the Family Court and experienced some of the problems. It is interesting to note that some 40 per cent of people in this country are going to finish up in the Family Court in one form or another by the end of this century. So we are not talking about an area of administration that affects a small minority. We are talking about something that affects a large number of people. Therefore, it is more deserving of attention from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recently a parliamentary research service report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian family law: some current issues</EMPHASIS>, by Dr Juliet Behrens, a consultant to the law and public administration group, was released. I certainly do not have time this morning to go through the details of what she talks about and her findings, but I will say that she raises great concerns. It seems to me to be a pretty well reasoned paper. In it she states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. There needs to be greater coordination between the two levels of government on "family law issues"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The Commonwealth Government should legislate for a broader range of relationships than is currently the case</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. A great deal more should be done to change the rhetoric of children's rights in family law into reality</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The recommendations of the ALRC's report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Equality before the Law: Justice for Women</EMPHASIS>, concerning the treatment of violence in the home in family law should be legislated</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. The FLA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Family Law Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should be amended to make it clear that violence in the home is relevant in determining how property should be divided on marriage breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not saying that I support all the conclusions that she has come to but she has highlighted a number of very relevant issues that we need to talk about. Frequently when constituents come into my office&mdash;and I am sure you, Mr Speaker, and many other honourable members in this place have experienced this&mdash;they are concerned about costs. The costs to deal in the family law area these days are just phenomenal. Unfortunately, for many people, it is money that they do not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time scales are horrendous. It can take months just to get a hearing to get something ratified, or agreed to. The inconsistency of decisions means that you really do not know what is going to happen in your case. People in identical circumstances with the same judge being heard on different days have had different decisions made, so the lawyers who specialise in the field do not really know how to advise you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own personal case I had a solicitor who said, `Frankly, it depends on which judge you happen to draw.' There is no consistency in the rulings. There is no guidance as to what the situation is. When we went to court and saw our barrister for the first time on the morning of the case he said, `I really don't know whether we are going to do very well today or not because it'll depend on which court we are allocated.' We then found out which judge we had got and he said he thought we would probably be all right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For your case to depend on the whim of the judge, the luck of the draw as to which court you get, the state you go to, the judge who happens to be on duty that day or whether the judge got out on the right side of the bed, is an appalling state of affairs. There is need for some consistency and some guidelines to avoid a lot of the aggravation and difficulty and to ease the pain of people seeking advice and going through the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to say a couple of words about the counselling and mediation services that are available through the Family Court. One of the problems is that it is very difficult to get an appointment within several weeks. An emotional situation is quite often involved with a couple who have separated and are perhaps having a dispute over the children. They cannot afford to sit around having the next world war while waiting for the counselling services to become available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Counsellors have been known to take sides. They do not necessarily stand up afterwards to back up agreements made in those counselling sessions. One of the major problems in that whole counselling and mediation area is that usually the articulate person comes out the best, and that often is reflected in subsequent orders in the court. Where there is a power imbalance in the relationship, the weaker member may not be in the wrong but often loses because of his or her inability to be articulate or because of a lack of financial resources. The Family Court does not seem to acknowledge that situation in its administration of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a major failure in the way the court is organised, apart from the fact that when you go there you might have to wait for an hour or five hours before your case is even called, which is often bad news for people travelling interstate, those who have jobs or those with scarce resources. The failure is that the court itself does not carry out its own instructions. I know one notable case where a judge said in June, `I want this case brought back to me in November so that I can make a decision by December and the children's schooling will not be affected when the decision becomes operable in January.' The court administration did not even bother to bring the case forward and look at it until December and a date was set for the following March, which immediately destroyed the prospects of making any suitable schooling arrangements. I could go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I do not agree with the honourable member for Chifley in some areas, I think he makes a fundamental point that I would certainly commend Justice Nicholson to take on board. That point is that there are many administrative problems with the family law in this country. We all know about the Child Support Agency, but the Family Court administration, not just the law, needs to be sorted out. I urge the government to give it urgent attention. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`It's a bloody disgrace' were the words I used at Anzac Cove in the early hours of 25 April 1995 to describe a situation which, to my mind and those of many thousands of other Australians and New Zealanders, should never have happened. As well as being the 50th anniversary of the end of hostilities in World War II, 1995 is the year we celebrate the 80th anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove in 1915.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government in its wisdom chose to honour the memory of those who fought and died at this most hallowed of places by selecting nine young Australians, descendants of the original Anzacs, to return to Gallipoli to take part in and be the focal point of the celebrations this year. They were joined by three servicemen, also direct descendants, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), the shadow minister, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), and their wives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was privileged to be part of the pilgrimage, my motivation being the fact that my late father, Robert Quick, served with the 7th Battalion at Gallipoli. All who went had in their own minds their separate and personal thoughts about what they would find on the Gallipoli Peninsula and whether the many stories they had listened to and the diaries they had read would convey the real meaning of what took place there so long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day before we left for Turkey, the pilgrims were farewelled at the Merrylands RSL by 40 World War I veterans, some of whom made the trip back to Anzac Cove five years before to celebrate the 75th anniversary. These blokes are now known as national treasures&mdash;a term coined by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. This was an emotional time for all of us as we shared their memories of a place we would soon visit. Later that evening we were feted and farewelled at a function at the Gallipoli Club in Sydney. Leaving Australia, many of us were not just carrying memorabilia from our own families, but carrying it for others in our community. They wanted us to take back to that hallowed place souvenirs, colour patches, photos, letters of loved ones and diaries of those who served there so long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Touring Istanbul made us realise that we were in the streets of the city that proved so elusive for our forefathers to capture 80 years ago. It really hit us that we had finally arrived at a special part of the world when we drove through the town of Gelibolu, or Gallipoli as we know it. To actually be able to see the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelle Straits first hand and not just from photos in books increased our enthusiasm for what lay ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, the pilgrims, were fortunate to have as our guide for the battle sites Kenan Celik, a Gallipoli historian and English teacher at one of the high schools in Canakkale. The two days prior to Anzac Day were spent exploring the various sites&mdash;Anzac Cove, Lone Pine, the Nek, Shrapnel Gully, Cape Helles and Gaba Tepe. These were very special days for each of us as we individually sought out places, graves and trenches that held memories for our relations who fought there. Kenan embellished our memories with his expert commentaries at each site and in all places enabled us to better understand what actually took place those 80 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we returned on the ferry from the peninsula, fresh from the many memories gained as we explored the trenches, picked poppies, waded ashore at Anzac Cove, read our diaries as we sat alone by special gravestones, you can imagine that most of the touring party had started to build up expectations regarding the dawn service to be held the following morning. Most of us found it difficult to sleep that night, and it was not just because we had to get up at 3.30 a.m. to catch the ferry. All of us had attended dawn services before, but this was the special one&mdash;Anzac Cove for the 80th anniversary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arriving at that hallowed of all places for Australians, we were greeted by an amazing sight. Thousands, from all parts of the globe, had gathered in the darkness to participate in the ceremony. Candles flickered in the pre-dawn darkness, someone played <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waltzing Matilda</EMPHASIS> on a mouth organ and Australian flags fluttered in the crowd. The air was electric with expectation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the pilgrims braced themselves for the emotion charged ceremony that was about to envelop them. Tears glistened on cheeks as the lone piper played his mournful dirge prior to the arrival of the Governor-General. A hush gathered over the assembled throng as we waited for the official party. The last strains of the piper wafted over the darkened hills that tower over Anzac Cove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mindful of standing order 74, I would now like to recount how this wonderful atmosphere of solemnity and remembrance was totally destroyed by a lack of thought and understanding on the part of what I would call `the official party'. To everyone's dismay, 5.30 arrived and there was no sign of the Governor-General and the other high ranking dignitaries. There were gentle murmurings in the crowd, but because of the security and the amount of traffic on the roads we could all excuse a slight delay. Fifteen minutes passed. The soldiers were still at reverse arms with heads bowed; it was still dark but the approaching dawn light enabled us to see the outlines of the hills behind us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The atmosphere and solemnity that is a dawn service were rapidly dissipating; tempers not only among our pilgrimage party but throughout the assembled throng became frayed. Voices could be heard expressing outrage that this service, above all others, could be desecrated in this way. `Start without them.' `It's a bloody disgrace.' `Why haven't they let us know they'll be late?' Tears of frustration could be seen running down the faces of the pilgrims as they saw the fiasco unfolding before them. `Our leaders stuffed it up before; it is happening once again,' shouted someone from the crowd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six-fifteen a.m., 45 minutes after the scheduled start. Dawn. Daylight bathed the thousands huddled at the cove. The dignitaries finally turned up. We were all beyond caring. We had each in our own way paid our respects to the memories of our forefathers and we went through the ceremony with our thoughts far away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`At least we have the ceremony at Long Pine; let's forget this and concentrate on Lone Pine,' commented someone in our party. We journeyed down to the international ceremony at the Martyrs Memorial at Morto Bay, and once this concluded we headed back to Lone Pine. As I stated previously, the 75th anniversary contained the original Anzacs; the 80th has their descendants. One would rightly assume that in the Lone Pine ceremony these 12 young Australians would feature prominently, be the centrepiece of this ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lone Pine, for those lucky enough to go there, has a haunting and wistful beauty. For me it is a special place, as my father's battalion, the 7th, fought there with distinction, winning four Victoria Crosses and losing 12 officers and 342 other ranks in these trenches. My wreath was to be placed at that beautiful place in memory of my father and his comrades, many of whom lie buried there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the morning fiasco at Anzac Cove, we were all looking forward to a service at Lone Pine. Because of the security evident on the peninsula, our bus arrived between five and seven minutes late. Unbelievably, the `official party', the Governor-General and the ambassador, David Evans, had decided to start without the pilgrims and the minister, those people who should have been the focal point of this wholly Australian ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reasons for the delay in the morning ceremony were believed but not excused: protocol demanded that the dawn service commence on time irrespective of what travel arrangements had been made. Lone Pine was ours, a totally Australian affair. The ambassador knew we were not there and should have insisted that the Governor-General wait for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the same officials to compound the anguish of the pilgrims was beyond belief. Our party was forced to scramble from the bus with our wreaths and hustle our way through the large crowd to find that the ceremony was almost over. I expected better of our representatives. To do this and then wholly ignore the pilgrims, and for the head of state not even to meet and talk with them, does not fit with his high office, nor the spirit of being an Australian epitomised by this hallowed place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feeble attempts by the Foreign Affairs officials to paper over this disaster do them little credit. I sincerely hope that any future pilgrimage will be wholly the domain of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which recognises the importance of this place and those who fought and died there. It certainly would not put the welfare of veterans' descendants second to trade considerations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this morning's grievance debate I want to highlight a couple of things that have taken place in my part of Australia, the electorate of Lyne, on the mid-north coast. They revolve around community service obligations as far as the provision of services by government is concerned. This is a very important subject that will sift through to the higher level regarding a lot of issues of concern to the constituents in my electorate and, indeed, the taxpayers of Australia. Later this morning the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts will table a report into the efficiency and appropriateness of the commercialisation of government business enterprises. An integral part of that report is about the identification, funding and provision of CSOs to people around Australia and particularly people in regional Australia, outside the greater metropolitan areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to concentrate on this morning regarding the electorate of Lyne is what I perceive to be the very important community service obligations regarding the services provided by government or semi-government bodies. Since coming into this place in March 1993 I have been continually pressuring the minister for communications with regard to the extension of SBS television services into my area. They have gradually come down the coast and in the current program I believe they are being extended into the northern parts of New South Wales, but not quite down to the mid-north coast region of New South Wales. The consistent answer I get from the minister is that these decisions are made based on growth generally but particularly on population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, the mid-north coast of New South Wales between Forster and Port Macquarie is experiencing enormous growth equal to that anywhere else in Australia. During the time when I received these answers from the minister for communications, SBS television services were extended into the north-west areas of Tasmania. I fail to see the growth that has taken place in the mid-north coast in New South Wales being outdone by growth taking place in north-western Tasmania. The most pressing issue at the moment is that of ABC radio services on the mid-north coast of New South Wales and regional Australia. In years gone by we have received the service in my electorate based at Kempsey, radio 2KPTR. It services an area from Coffs Harbour down to the Forster, Tuncurry and Gloucester areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of last year I made an adjournment debate speech in this chamber about the changes being made to the services provided by ABC radio in my electorate. The position of the journalist posted at Taree, servicing Taree, Forster and Gloucester, was being relocated to Coffs Harbour. That decision has been made permanent now. So in regard to ABC radio services on the coast of New South Wales, from Lismore to Kempsey there are six journalists: at Lismore, Grafton, Coffs Harbour and Kempsey&mdash;a distance of 300 kilometres down the coast. From Kempsey to Newcastle, which covers Port Macquarie, Taree, Forster, Tuncurry, Gloucester and Bulahdelah and, I might add, down into the government-held electorate of Paterson, how many journalists are there? None. Another 300 kilometres and there are no journalists; there is no service from the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So community organisations, local government, state government bodies and representatives, federal government bodies and representatives have no access face to face with journalists to get their message across through the taxpayers' owned organisation, the ABC. That decision has been taken recently. I will reiterate it: in the 300 kilometres from Lismore to Kempsey there are six journalists. In the 300 kilometres from Kempsey to Newcastle there are no journalists. There is no service being provided in an area where there is probably a population of 200,000-odd people. I bring this to the attention of the House and I propose to raise it with the minister yet again. I know that the response I will get is that it is an ABC management decision; it has nothing to do with me. But it is of great concern to me when my constituents are trying to access information and I am doing interviews with a journalist in Coffs Harbour, 200 kilometres away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that speech in October 1994 on the adjournment debate, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taree outpost services&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this was at the time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the biggest ABC audience in this region in an area which includes the fastest growing town in New South Wales&mdash;Forster/Tuncurry&mdash;the population of which grew by 30 per cent in the period 1986-91. The city of greater Taree grew by 25 per cent in that period. In contrast, Coffs Harbour&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and in due deference to my colleague the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">grew by only 14 per cent . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And that is where this position has been relocated to. So we have the main base station at Kempsey, a journalist at Coffs Harbour and nothing at Port Macquarie, Taree or Forster-Tuncurry. I then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audience response on 2KPTR is by far greatest in the region encompassing Forster/Tuncurry, Taree and Gloucester . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Bear in mind that part of the Forster-Tuncurry area and Gloucester are in the electorate of the member for Paterson (Mr Horne)&mdash;and I am sure that he has been made aware of the withdrawal of these services. So we have the greatest audience response in the region which has lost all the services of the journalists who have been taken out by management decision. I just highlight that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, some of the decisions that have been taken by the ABC management as far as its radio services are concerned are very interesting. Some interesting statistics have been brought to light by the research that has been undertaken following these actions. The information coming from the department of planning indicates that the Coffs Harbour outpost covers Coffs Harbour and Bellingen, with a population of 700,400 people; the Kempsey news room covers Nambucca, Kempsey and Port Macquarie, with a population of 91,500 people; and the now closed Taree bureau, as it was, covered Taree, Forster-Tuncurry and Gloucester, with a population of 71,900 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New population projections about to be released by the department of planning give the following population estimates for the areas in the year 2001: Coffs Harbour, 79,000 people; Nambucca, Kempsey and Port Macquarie, 112,000 people; and Taree, Forster-Tuncurry and Gloucester, 89,000 people. The actual urban centre populations are: Coffs Harbour, 20,000; Forster-Tuncurry, 14,000; and Taree 16,000. So as to the actual population centres now, as they are serviced, there is in excess of 30,000-odd people in the Forster-Tuncurry area who have no service, and we have built up or boosted the service in Coffs Harbour where there is a population centre of 20,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is beyond me to understand this decision. I do not believe that the ABC is providing a service to the region that is equitable, as far as government intentions should be where community service obligations are concerned. If we look at the 1993-94 ABC annual report, the ABC's objectives are `to provide the best programs, performances, products and services it possibly can to all the people of Australia and to our target audiences overseas'. It says that it will do this by `providing the best, most reliable and independent coverage and analysis of contemporary issues, ideas and international, national and regional events'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That begs the question: in providing the best possible products and services to all the people of Australia and to cover regional events, it is beyond me how the ABC will adequately cover on ABC radio the regional events that take place between Port Macquarie and Newcastle in the south&mdash;a distance of 300 kilometres&mdash;without any journalists, apart from the journalist based in Coffs Harbour who is actually delegated with the responsibility of covering the day-to-day events in that area. The lady is doing quite a good job; I do quite a few radio interviews. But the present situation is nothing like the situation where, upon an event occurring in Taree, we would have the local commercial radio news person turning up, the ABC news person turning up, the community FM radio news person turning up. The ABC radio news person cannot turn up because she is based at Coffs Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that my area in the electorate of Lyne on the mid-north coast is being discriminated against. I cannot understand this management decision and, as far as I am concerned, it is quite inequitable. I repeat: 300 kilometres, Lismore, Grafton, Coffs Harbour, Kempsey&mdash;six journalists; Kempsey, Port Macquarie, Taree, Gloucester, Forster-Tuncurry, Bulahdelah&mdash;no journalists. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Between 21 and 26 April this year, I was privileged to represent the Speaker at the 75th anniversary of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and to participate in the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the Anzac landing at Gallipoli. I was joined on that occasion by a number of members, including the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who is in the chamber today, and the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). Representatives from the Senate included Senator Baden Teague, Senator Grant Chapman and Senator Michael Baume and their families. It was a very moving occasion and, like most Australians who have had the opportunity to be present at Gallipoli on Anzac Day, something that all the delegation looked forward to with great anticipation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague and friend the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) had a very special reason for being there. He was part of the separate pilgrimage organised by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). I wholeheartedly concur with the sentiments he expressed in the grievance debate this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not dwell too much on the dawn service, but I will relay my concern and my grievance at some of the events that occurred subsequent to the dawn service. I will begin by making the point that, from about 9.30, most members of the delegation were present at the international service. The Governor-General, as the principal international representative, was able to give the speech on behalf of the international representatives at that ceremony on 25 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some distance between the Turkish memorial and the Australian memorial at Lone Pine, where a special commemoration ceremony was scheduled for later in the day. As the member for Franklin has commented, the whole point about this event was the fact that some descendants of the original Anzacs were involved in a very special pilgrimage to mark the occasion of the 80th anniversary. He has already indicated the excitement and obvious anticipation of that event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of our arrival at Lone Pine, the parliamentary delegation moved to an area near the memorial, principally because no-one from the department of foreign affairs seemed to know where we should stand. Members of the general public were positioned in an area which was roped off. At the time of our arrival the ambassador, Mr David Evans, and the Governor-General were speaking to the public, presumably waiting for the rest of the group to be in place. They had received an official escort and were in position some considerable time ahead of our arrival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would appreciate, security was intense because President Demirel was on the Gallipoli Peninsula at that time. Some members of the delegation became concerned when we moved into position because the Foreign Affairs officials could not locate the wreaths that had been ordered by certain members of the delegation ahead of the ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administrative assistant to the head of mission, Ms Betty Sutinen, was in charge of these arrangements. She said that there was no wreath for the parliamentary secretary, the member for Herbert, and there was not a second wreath for Senator Grant Chapman. This second wreath had a very special significance to Senator Chapman, who was accompanied by his spouse and his two children. His son was the captain of the prep school at Prince Alfred College in Adelaide. He was laying a wreath on behalf of his school, which had 14 members as part of the original Anzacs, and some of those 14 lost their lives. Senator Chapman was visibly upset&mdash;and I do not blame him&mdash;at the mess-up that occurred. The member for Herbert was also upset, and he then moved to a separate part of the proceedings. Subsequently, the missing wreath was found and given to Senator Chapman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was obvious at this point that the Governor-General, the ambassador and the rest of the official party were moving into place for the commencement of the ceremony. I commented to Ms Sutinen that surely the ceremony could not begin in the absence of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the shadow minister and the nine pilgrims who were accompanying them. She commented to me that the ceremony had to begin as there were time constraints. I further suggested to her that, knowing the reaction of my parliamentary colleagues, the minister and the shadow minister, she should think again and perhaps advise the ambassador that the minister, the shadow minister and the official party were not yet in place. Again she ignored those requests and then, of course, the ceremony went ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Captain Jackson, who was the master of ceremonies on the occasion&mdash;I attach no blame to Captain Jackson, who was simply carrying out orders&mdash;then began the ceremony. I turned to Ms Sutinen and said that it was an absolute disgrace that such a ceremony would commence in the absence of the minister. The ambassador then came to the microphone, apologised to the gathering for the events at the dawn service and explained to those gathered that many of the events had been beyond the control of the Australian authorities&mdash;comments I largely endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was obvious, though, that the ceremony was going to continue. I suggested to the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, that he be ready to deliver the speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. To my amazement then, the captain called upon the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to give his address. There was, understandably, a pregnant pause. There was a titter from the crowd, laughter, and, of course, total embarrassment among the rest of the party gathered for this very special occasion. To his credit, the Minister for Trade went forward and delivered the speech&mdash;mistake and all. I had pointed out to the deputy head of mission the day before that the speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs contained a reference to Friday, 25 April when it should have read Tuesday, 25 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the Governor-General gave his speech. Shortly afterwards, the rest of the official party, including the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the shadow minister and the pilgrims, arrived. Even when the shadow minister read the ode and there was a wreath laying ceremony, Ms Sutinen asked me whether I knew who Wilson Tuckey was. I suggested to some of my colleagues that she must be the only person in Australia never to have heard of Wilson Tuckey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I make no criticism whatsoever of Captain Jackson in my grievance today. In my view, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's inadequacy is being shifted largely, I believe, to the Australian Defence Force because the department knew it would be very difficult for the ADF to respond. I am grateful for the reports that have been given to me to examine by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, but I must say in this House that some of those reports are at odds with my observations and, I would suggest, the observations of many other members who were present on that particular occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that, at the very least, Ms Sutinen be certainly severely reprimanded for providing an obviously false statement to the department of foreign affairs and that Mr Perry, who was charged with the responsibility of organising the events, should have his position very closely examined. In my view, the organisation was absolutely disgraceful. It was appalling. There was little attention to the detail of the solemnity of the occasion and some of the basic techniques that any organisation should be aware of were totally ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it quite fascinating and quite appalling that at the wreath laying ceremony that took place towards the end of the proceedings we as members of parliament, but even more significantly the nine pilgrims, were somewhat herded like sheep or cattle without there being any account taken of the significance and special meaning of the occasion by Mr Perry, who seemed intent on getting the ceremony over and on fulfilling the time obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attach a great deal of blame to Mr Perry. At the conclusion of the ceremony I asked Captain Jackson who gave him the order to commence the proceedings and he clearly beckoned to me that it was Mr Perry. I have no reason to doubt that advice from the officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great occasion was marred by a disgraceful piece of organisation. It seems that 80 years later the confusion and the planning mishaps are a continuing legacy. As the saying goes, on this occasion: the tradition continues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, as honourable members would be aware by the previous comments, seek to grieve today about a circumstance that really and truly destroyed what must have been one of the great highlights of my political career and one of the great highlights for a group of young Australians who are descendants of Anzac veterans some of whom are buried on the Gallipoli Peninsula. They were also greatly downgraded as a result of what were just plainly foolish planning arrangements associated with the events of 25 April 1995 on the Gallipoli Peninsula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, as the custodian for the coalition of the Australia Remembers program, as must be very plain to the parliament, I have been committed totally to avoiding controversy in terms of conduct this year. I think whether it be the Gallipoli program, the other ceremonies, the general activities or the distribution of money&mdash;everything&mdash;I am not prepared and will continue to not be prepared to allow minor issues to override the great bipartisan support that exists in this parliament for what is a wonderful remembrance program of the contribution of literally millions of Australians in the wars that are past and in particular those who attended and fought at Gallipoli where 8,141 Australians were killed and 17,970 were wounded. So let me just put that on the record because I do feel, as obviously members of the government feel, that criticism is warranted. I just do not want it in any way thought of as a criticism of the general program and Australia's outstanding commitment to remembering the efforts of soldiers and service personnel of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me just add to the remarks that have been made. I was very grateful for the invitation to be one of the party that travelled directly to Turkey. In fact, after a short stay in Istanbul, I went to the peninsula to spend four days there not only just to attend the ceremony but also to spend two days on the battlefields with the assistance, as the member for Franklin (Mr Quick) has drawn to our attention, of an outstanding Turkish academic, Kenan Celik, who gave us huge enlightenment as to the war with the benefit of his 12 years of research into it. I think he exploded a few myths for us but he certainly highlighted the high regard of the Turks for the skills and the courage of Australians in what was a very difficult task, which he identified as being the people who had to draw away from the British landing a large proportion of the Turkish defenders, which they did. They were sent to Anzac Cove with that purpose in mind, which of course is proper military strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were given a very well organised tour, if I can use that word, during the two days prior to going to the ceremony. We viewed the battlefields and the intensity that we understood in that battle. We are talking about an area fought over by tens of thousands, where 8,000 Australians were killed, which is only half the size of my farm! When you see trenches that are eight metres apart from opposing forces you can understand the words that I used at one stage, that this was one of the last battles where the human body was the principal weapon of war. It was tragic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when we had been there and experienced that we headed off for the ceremony, which was a dawn service. The Australian dawn service is because of that dawn landing. Our whole procedure to remember the fallen is built around the dawn. That is not common to many countries. It is not common to the Turks, who conducted their ceremony later in the day. So, as the member for Franklin said, we were woken at 2.30 in the morning because there was no accommodation on the Gallipoli Peninsula; it is a national park. We had to be transported across the Dardanelles. We were loaded on to buses to get to Anzac Cove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As the member for Franklin said, I guess the first thing to strike us was that we were preceded by literally thousands of people, primarily Australians. There was a very large number of young people who were backpackers, many of whom we had met in the streets of Canakkale. It was mentioned that I am well known. I was delighted to be confronted by a number of these young people in the streets and in the restaurants wanting to talk to me. They knew who I was and they were delighted to see me present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here were all these people; here was the ceremony; and then, as an observer, things started to go wrong. Our huge media contingent&mdash;not unexpected; everyone knew they were going to be there; the service was well publicised&mdash;had no facilities whatsoever. Consequently, they sought to crowd around the memorial to the dissatisfaction of the other thousands of people&mdash;quite properly. But, as one television camera man was herded away, he said, `Well, there are 2,000 there, but I am trying to get a message to 18 million.' Nobody thought to give them a couple of elevated stands where they would not interfere with the people, yet which at the same time would give them some opportunity to pass this great ceremony back. That was one of the first things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone had put up a lectern for the purpose of delivering these speeches, but it was behind a tree. You could not see the speakers from it, and nobody knew where to stand. There was no organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we were in the dark. Young people were on the hills behind that had been climbed and fought over by our soldiers. They knew why they were there because they had bought Australian flags. One of the great pictures of the whole thing was one of those young fellas up there with his flag. Everybody knew what they were there for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden, out of the blue, it starts&mdash;at 5.30. They march the Kiwi soldiers&mdash;as it happened to be this year&mdash;into their positions as a guard of honour, and over in the crowd they started to light all these candles. All of a sudden we had the piper, and then we had nothing. We just watched this whole thing collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just could not understand it, because all we needed was one phone call from an officer of the people who were delayed. A lot of Australians were delayed, as well as the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand. All they had to say was, `Go without us. It's a dawn service. We understand that.' I can say that it was not their fault, except that I thought their schedule for getting the people there was impossible. The ship was to anchor an hour before our ceremony. I just thought that was ridiculous in terms of planning. Somebody should have said something. At that point you could not ask the soldiers there; you could not even ask the members of the embassy to say, `We're going without the Governor-General.' Someone on his staff or on the other staffs should have simply sent the message&mdash;and communication was available&mdash;`Go without us.' By the time they got there, the speeches could have been made at the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to do something in this parliament to ensure&mdash;maybe an amendment to the Anzac Day Act is the answer&mdash;that it never happens again. The fundamental thing is that it is 5.30, if that is the time that is appropriate on Anzac Cove for the ceremony. Let us say that it should be primarily conducted by our service personnel and the clergy; let us say that there should be hymns. We had no hymns. We had good background music with a beautiful PA system, but nobody thought to give us some background music for a couple of hymns. It would have brought another tear to my eye, I have to say, but that is how the ceremony should be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few seconds I have remaining, let me concur with the other two speakers. The big deal for our pilgrims was the second ceremony at Lone Pine. The first one had to be conducted on time; the second one could have been half an hour late; and we got the reverse of that. But, worse, by that time those young people's expectations were very high. In fact, most of them had brought other items with their wreaths to put before the shrine. Some had the names of their relatives listed there. Some had found the gravestones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They should have gone through one at a time. They should have been introduced. They should have told where they came from. If you could please give me another minute, Mr Deputy Speaker, they were called out as a group, and they were sent through two at a time as though they were just members of the public. It was their ceremony. Why were they sent through two at a time? So the official party could get away to a luncheon with the President. They had plenty of time for that luncheon. As we discovered later, they had double the amount of time because the President just happened to be an hour late getting on to the ferry that then went out to this luncheon. He knew where his responsibilities were: they were to the Turkish people and the ceremonies that were going on on the peninsula. We wanted to rush our officials back to the bay. It just was not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wanted those points to be made. It was a tragedy of a great ceremony. I hope that, when we come up with some solutions by way of a little bit of simple legislation, we can all support it in this parliament, as we have supported everything that has happened this year. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your consideration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I concur with the comments made by my colleagues this morning in the grievance debate about the difficulties they encountered on their mission to Gallipoli for the celebration of the 80th anniversary of Anzac Day. This morning I rise to bring to the attention of honourable members the contempt with which the opposition holds the north coast of New South Wales. Last week the Senate committee on long-term unemployment, led by Senator John Tierney, visited the Tweed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure members that the actions of Senator Tierney were nothing more than a political stunt, as the day prior to the hearing the opposition frontbench also visited the Tweed. I can understand why it would want to hold a shadow cabinet meeting in that location at this particular time of the year. I am sure the people there enjoyed the amenities, not to mention the climate. It was all very conveniently timed, you may well suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney later stated that he was concerned that unemployment levels in the Richmond-Tweed area could reach levels of the Great Depression. Not once did Senator Tierney attempt to back up any of his rhetoric with figures. His concern was nothing more than a cheap attempt to have a shot at the government at the time. Unfortunately, all he managed to do was show his utter contempt for the region and the hardworking people across the region who have committed their time and efforts to get the region moving. But why let the facts get in the way of a good headline, you may ask. Senator Tierney certainly did not, nor did the daily news at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) pointed out on local radio, unemployment in the Richmond-Tweed region has fallen from 17.5 per cent to 12.1 per cent in the last 12 months. In actual fact, the figures started to show a downward trend at the start of 1993 and that steady decline has continued all the way. At each three-monthly interval when the figures are released I am asked to  comment, at the behest of the media, as a result of comments made by my political wannabes. I respond by pointing out that the figures are showing a downward trend, which is to be commended, and that it is a hopeful sign, but certainly there is a lot of work to be done because, obviously, the unemployment figure is still too high. I did that on every occasion during the year, so on at least four occasions I did that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that time, 25,600 jobs have been created and the participation rate in the region has increased. These are not pie in the sky figures or any of that hollow rhetoric that coalition candidates in the region are renowned for but are figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Despite the fact that there was only one set of figures used in the editorial in the daily news, the editorial did state that there was a dispute on local unemployment figures between me and Senator Tierney. So what figures were in dispute?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment, while it has fallen in the region, is still unacceptably high. We cannot afford to be complacent just because of this fall. I have never backed down from that statement, nor have I ever neglected to say it. Having grown up and been educated on the north coast, I am well aware of just how far back the chronic nature of unemployment extends on the north coast. I went to school there and, like most of my friends who finished school, without having a tertiary institution established there, I had one option and that was to get on the train and head for Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most would also be aware of coalition politicians and hopefuls changing their opinion now to see unemployment as a government fault and not that of the unemployed. It is a welcome change for them not to be blaming the unemployed for being unemployed. Nevertheless, there certainly has been a sea change in their attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of unemployment is something the federal government will continue to tackle through innovative employment programs targeting the needs of employers in the region. As I understand it, the only legacy of decades of National Party representation in the seat of Richmond is the Murwillumbah Post Office. It takes only a drive through any part of my electorate&mdash;Tweed Heads, Byron Bay or Ballina&mdash;to realise that the north coast economy is growing rapidly and new jobs are being created, bringing with it long-term benefits to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How dare Senator Tierney treat the region with such contempt. Maybe I should remind him that the Northern Rivers region was the first region in Australia to establish a regional development organisation. That organisation, the Northern Rivers Economic Development Organisation, or NOREDO&mdash;an organisation that has worked tirelessly for the betterment of the region&mdash;is pulling the region together and striving towards the future. It is made up of many different organisations across the region&mdash;some of them, I would dare say, have quite diverse political persuasions, not to mention economic and sociological backgrounds. Nevertheless, they come together in NOREDO and they work for the common betterment of the north coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NOREDO has received funding through DEET and the Department of Housing and Regional Development and now has a chief executive officer, Mr Charles Liggett, at the helm. With NOREDO, the North Coast Area Consultative Committee is now driving initiatives from the Working Nation package on the ground in the Northern Rivers region. In some ways there seems to be some concern from Senator Tierney and others that there may be some success in that. I hope there is, and I hope that, if that is the reason for their concern, they do have great concern. I have met with Mr Liggett on a number of occasions and have impressed upon him the need for these programs to be implemented across the region. I am glad to see that this is now happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NOREDO is a unique organisation in that it has the broad support of a wide cross-section of community, industry, employer and trade union representatives. But the people who deserve the accolades in this situation are the north coast employers. Employers are the best people to create and sustain jobs. I point out, as I have done on a number of occasions in this House, that the north coast has probably the largest number of small business operators per capita of any area in Australia. I know New South Wales has the largest number of small business operators per capita of any state, and the north coast has certainly the highest of any region within New South Wales. So this region probably has the greatest number of small business operators anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would Senator Tierney like to say to the employers who have created some 25,600 jobs in the year to March? The region is far from reaching the unemployment levels of the Great Depression. Far from it&mdash;the region is growing rapidly in terms of both population and economic growth, a factor that Senator Tierney seems to wish to disregard. Our tourism sector continues to grow, particularly the ecotourism sector. Exciting opportunities are being explored in the Byron Bay region in multimedia, and there are the knowledge and skills in that area to develop a major multimedia industry. It could even become an industry leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many exciting possibilities in terms of industry development in the region. It is about time the perpetual knockers of the region, and in this case some coalition supported wannabes, started to wake up and smell just one or two of the roses. It is important that the community as a whole and the government work together to keep the region moving. I am certainly committed to doing that. The negativity uttered by raving senators like Senator Tierney, and for that matter some local conservatives talking down the region, does not achieve anything at all. It is about time some of the local National Party apparatchiks and others around the region woke up and faced some facts about, firstly, unemployment and, secondly, some local bungling from the former government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go into that, I wish to point out in the few remaining minutes that I have to speak that I understand Senator Tierney will propose a motion to the Senate with regard to some of the figures I have quoted. The figures that I have quoted are those put out by both DSS and ABS. There is a difference between the ABS and the DSS figures. They have to be compared very carefully. The ABS figures take the standard that is set down by international labour organisations so that we can compare ourselves on an international basis. The DSS figures obviously are those which come from the local offices. There are substantial differences between those, and I will point out just one or two of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS series includes unemployed persons whose spouses are working, irrespective of income, whereas the jobsearch allowance and the newstart recipients are subject to an income and assets test for themselves and their spouses. The ABS series also includes persons being paid a pension but looking for work. For example, a sole parent in receipt of a sole parent pension looking for work would be included in those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the difference means that they have to be compared very carefully. Two of the major things Senator Tierney does not seem to want to recognise at all is that the DSS figures he has quoted also include those people who are working part time and that the population is growing on the north coast&mdash;by some five per cent or six per cent over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another fact that seems to be disregarded is that the participation rate has increased substantially. In other words, more people are seeking to re-enter the work force on the north coast. Overall, I think Senator Tierney had better have another look at the integrity behind some of his comments. In the small amount of time that I have left, I would very much like to point out that in some of the bungling&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is with this federal Labor government and its inability and unwillingness to deal with the complexities and inefficiencies inherent in Australia's centralised wage fixing award system. Australia's centralised system of wage fixation and labour market regulation is one of the most complex and overregulated anywhere in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently there are approximately 2,500 federal awards in force, varying in length from 10 to 300 pages. The awards are full of examples of inefficient and outdated work practices which have interfered with the ability to transform the workplace into a flexible and competitive environment. Australia can no longer afford to maintain an uncompetitive labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Awards have traditionally been overprescribed in terms of content and coverage because of their protected legal status, enforced by the Industrial Relations Commission, and the bargaining strength of trade unions. However, there have been recent improvements to the system, such as broadbanding of award classifications, development of training and skill models, and provisions for career structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there are still numerous award complexities yet to be addressed. The most obvious are: too many award classifications; excessive penalty rates, special conditions and allowances; outdated, poorly written and overlapping clauses; overlapping state and federal jurisdiction; rigid and outdated work practices; and expensive administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of federal awards reveals the problems associated with the complexity of award provisions. The metal industries award 1984 is a benchmark award that influences many national wage increases through the flow-on effect. It is arguably the most complex and fought over of all federal awards. Some of the statistics for the MTA 1984 award are as follows: there are 288 pages; over 200 penalty/special rates, excluding non-cash payments such as clothing, tools and food; 340 different award classifications; 26 basic pay rates; coverage of 63 industries or workplace classifications; nine unions are respondents to the award; and coverage of more than 400,000 employees in over 10,000 different enterprises or companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The metal trades award terms of reference have extensive scope and coverage. Many of the 288 pages relate to employee classifications, wages and working conditions. There are numerous mandatory award conditions that include: boiling water at meal times; drinking water, which must be wholesome and cool and dispensed by bubble taps or other suitable drinking fountains; seats for females, in addition to adequate toilet seats; a notice board and the positioning thereof; and special allowances for damaged spectacles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions add unnecessary bulk to an already lengthy document. Although many of the conditions are reasonable, the great majority could be satisfied under various occupational health and safety statutory regulations. If needed, additional requirements could be included at the enterprise level that were specific to the individual enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the more complex features of this award are sections that have been added on to previous clauses, covering aspects such as special rates and conditions in different states and industries. These variations were made to allow for regional differences and for special circumstances. However, their effect has been to add unnecessary complexity to wage rate calculations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best example of unnecessary complexity is clause 37, which refers to special provisions for various districts, industries, plants, et cetera. This clause covers 20 pages and lists separate rates of pay, penalty rates, allowances and employee definitions for different states, territories and enterprises. An employer who has plants in more than one state would have to calculate multiple wage variations for each enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of excessive variation in the MTA is the debacle over Boxing Day. According to the award, Boxing Day is a public holiday in all states except South Australia where it is Proclamation Day, except for Whyalla where it is Boxing Day. It is provisions such as these that make the award excessively lengthy and unnecessarily difficult to decipher, particularly for the small employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small employers find it difficult to ascertain their award obligations in an easy and concise manner. The use of enterprise specific awards and/or certified agreements would greatly reduce many of these unnecessary complexities. Under such a system, award provisions would include only those relevant to the individual enterprise. Employers and employees would then be free to tailor an agreement that best meets their needs and would better reflect an employer's capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Metal Trades Award also fails to take into account multi-skilling of employees. The classification structure is rigid and, with few exceptions, does not allow for one worker to perform multiple tasks. Broadbanding of base wage rates has made the base rate calculations simpler, but the 340 different award classifications remain and each has various allowances attached. With increasing demands on modern business for more multi-skilling of employees, outdated and inefficient award structures desperately need to be changed. Unions have been reluctant to support changes to award classifications because many fear this will lead to competition for membership and the end of exclusive coverage rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further examples of award complexities include the fact that the length of federal awards varies greatly from 10 to over 300 pages. The reason for these variations is largely due to the extent and coverage of each award. In many instances, the more variations contained in an award the greater its extent, coverage and complexity. This would indicate that many awards, particularly those more than 50 pages, need to be examined for excessive content. For example, the Transport Workers Award 1991 is approximately 225 pages long and covers workers in most states and territories. It has 14 base rates and more than 60 special allowances. The award has been amended 141 times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Graphic Arts Award 1977 has numerous examples of too many subclauses regulating working conditions and wage rates of employees. Clause 42 covers 24 pages of work conditions, including the size limit of screens employees are to use. Clause 33, production of drawings, strictly forbids payment of wages for piecework and only permits an hourly rate. There is no allowance in this award provision, clause 33, for flexible wage payments and/or incentives for piecework. While clause 33 protects minimum wage entitlements, it rejects the possibility of over-award payments based on the productivity level of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many mandatory working conditions and federal awards are covered under state law in various health and safety acts. Some awards have resolved the problem of concurrent powers by giving state statutes precedence over federal awards. Clause 44 in the Metal Trades Award gives the South Australian Industrial Safety, Health and Welfare Act 1972 overriding jurisdiction over industrial award provisions. It could be argued that award provisions relevant to state or federal statutory regulations, such as occupational health and safety, should be removed from awards and enforced under the appropriate statute. This would greatly reduce the complexity and length of awards while placing the enforcement of uniform conditions in the hands of the relevant professional authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various awards have outdated clauses that are yet to be changed. Some examples of existing award provisions are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every man shall have half a pound of meat a day in his allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each person is entitled to half a pint of free milk when bronzing/dusting machinery for 2 hours or more in the morning or afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA>That is contained in clause 48(i) of the Graphic Arts Award 1977. There are also examples of difficult to understand and legalistic clauses that make award interpretation cumbersome. One such example is contained in clause 28(c)(i) of the Graphic Arts Award, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should an employee to whom this subclause applies have less than twelve months' employment with his employer, the employer may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subclause (a) hereof, pay that employee pro rata wages calculated on the basis of one-fifth of his pay specified in subclause (a) hereof, for this period of employment which includes the period of close down.</PARA>
<PARA>Many organisations maintain that the award system should be reduced to a simple level. They believe that provisions should be made for basic hourly rates, holidays, equal pay for males and females, and simple basic award conditions. They also believe that the majority of working conditions in the workplace should be negotiated on an enterprise level. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there was widespread support for the proposal from the Victorian government and industry groups, the CSIRO division of the Community and Public Sector Union raised concerns regarding the proposal, particularly the impact on the research program. The committee, having carefully considered all the evidence presented to it, is of the view that relocation to Werribee is the most viable long-term option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that co-location at Werribee with the Australian Food Research Institute will lead to advantages in research collaboration and in reduced infrastructure costs through the sharing of common facilities such as the library, canteen, auditorium and workshops. In addition, relocation to Werribee offers the opportunity for collaboration with a wide range of both public and private research bodies which are, or will soon be, established in the Werribee area. The committee is also aware that the Dairy Research and Development Corporation has offered CSIRO a grant of $4 million towards equipment at Werribee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee accepts and understands the reluctance of staff to relocate to Werribee and also agrees that the relocation will have some temporary adverse impact on the research effort, the committee believes that the relocation will have a positive long-term impact on the work of the laboratory. In particular, the project provides opportunities to develop a coordinated research and development centre for the food industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third report of this hardworking and very busy committee which I have tabled deals with the proposed redevelopment of housing for service families at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS>. By way of background, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> is a significant and expanding Royal Australian Navy training establishment located at Western Port. There are currently 554 families located both on board HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> and ashore in the surrounding area. The proposal which the committee examined is aimed to partially redress the imbalance in housing available on board compared with ashore by increasing on board housing from 109 to 152 in accordance with the Defence Housing Authority mission to provide defence personnel and their families with good housing consistent with community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the works examined by the committee is the provision of an additional 55 houses on new and revised lots, the provision of 45 houses as replacements for existing substandard houses, substantial upgrading or replacement of 10 existing older brick houses and the retention of 27 existing houses which require less substantial works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When referred to the committee the estimated cost of the proposed redevelopment was $14.2 million. In recommending that the redevelopment should proceed, the committee has concluded that there is a need to replace or modernise existing on-board housing at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> to match contemporary standards and expectations. Many of the on-base houses are well below acceptable community standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the overall scope of the project, the committee has concluded that it is soundly based, the extent can be justified on the grounds of reduced cost penalties associated with the payment by Defence of isolated establishment allowances, it will enhance personnel efficiencies, and it makes good use of available land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of design features were commented upon during our inquiry and the committee therefore believes that the Defence Housing Authority should continue consultations with the Tenants Consultative Group concerning the provision of features and fittings which will enhance the habitability of the houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is planned that the housing area at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> may be excised from the base sometime in the future. The committee has therefore recommended that before this goes ahead it will be necessary for the sewerage system serving the housing area to be connected to the Hastings system independently of the base.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background to the Inquiry. </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is the result of the committee's inquiry into the commercialisation of public sector operations, which began nearly two years ago. In setting up the inquiry the committee was responding to concerns at that time about the operation of certain government business enterprises, GBEs, particularly the monopoly businesses of the Federal Airports Corporation, FAC, and the Civil Aviation Authority, CAA. The committee was also aware of a series of reports by the Auditor-General about difficulties with the introduction of commercialisation in departments of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee decided to limit its inquiry to examining commercialisation in GBEs and business units in departments of state, and to focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of commercialisation and corporatisation, particularly in the FAC, the CAA and the Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Efficiency and effectiveness, and the framework for commercialisation and corporatisation.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took evidence from 14 of the Commonwealth's 19 GBEs and five of the nine departments which have business units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We concluded that commercialisation and corporatisation have been successful in increasing the efficiency with which GBEs and business units deliver goods and services. This increased efficiency and effectiveness reflects the fact that, generally speaking, appropriate frameworks for commercialisation and corporatisation have been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The framework that has been established for the operation and oversight of GBEs has proved functional, and was finetuned with the issue of new guidelines in 1993. The oversight arrangements will be locked in and extended to cover government companies as well as GBEs with the passage, hopefully within the next month or so, of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill. As you may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has played a central role in the development of this legislation&mdash;first recommending that it be prepared in 1989 and then considering the bill in detail in report 331, which was tabled in September last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to GBEs, business units in departments of state are more recent creations and the framework for their operation is less well established and is still being developed. The committee believes that the Department of Finance should be taking a more prominent role than it has up to now in assisting departments to set up their business units. It should be putting more effort into monitoring the problems that arise in the course of commercialisation and identifying and disseminating best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also noted that business units in departments of state are currently disadvantaged by the requirements that being part of a department of state imposes. Given that corporatisation provides increased flexibility of operation, the committee has recommended that corporatisation should be extended to successful business units. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Key issues in commercialisation and corporatisation in the Commonwealth public sector.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee examined many aspects of the operation of GBEs and business units, more than I can cover in my speech here today. I have therefore selected three topics of importance on which I wish to concentrate. They are:</PARA>
<PARA>.safeguarding the public interest functions that were once required of what are now government businesses;</PARA>
<PARA>.the need for GBEs and business units to have clearly defined, non-conflicting, commercial objectives; and</PARA>
<PARA>.whether the arrangements for ministerial oversight of government businesses are fully appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In choosing to concentrate on these topics, I do not wish to give the impression that other matters were not considered&mdash;because they were, quite considerably. The committee's report also covers, for example, the accountability and financial regimes that apply to GBEs and business units, their performance in competing with the private sector, and the impact that commercialisation has had on staff. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The public interest: community service obligations.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years the government has become involved in providing essential goods and services when they were not available under reasonable circumstances from the private sector. When the provision of these goods and services is commercialised, charges are levied for them which may be too expensive for the consumer. In this case, the consumers' access to these goods and services has been safeguarded by the government imposing community service obligations&mdash;better known as CSOs&mdash;on the relevant GBEs to supply what is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee examined the system by which CSOs are identified, costed and funded, and has recommended that more attention be given to defining CSOs so that the social outcomes that the government requires are precisely known, and the methods of costing and funding them are clear. This observation applies whether the CSO is being delivered by a government-owned business or by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also believes that consumers and their representatives should be more involved than at present in helping to identify new CSOs and making changes to existing CSOs. In addition, consumers should play a larger part in monitoring the delivery of CSOs and assessing how well they are meeting needs. However, if consumers are to have a meaningful input into the definition and monitoring of CSOs, they will need to have better information about the goods and services provided as CSOs than is available at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another avenue for monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of CSO programs is through performance audits. The committee believes that there are strong arguments for the Auditor-General, who is at present effectively barred from carrying out performance audits on GBEs, being able to examine the delivery of CSOs. Scrutiny of the operation of CSO mechanisms by the Australian National Audit Office may bring substantial improvements to the efficiency with which CSOs are delivered. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Focusing on commercial performance: avoiding conflicting objectives.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the prerequisites for commercial success when parts of government departments are commercialised is that they are able to focus single-mindedly on their commercial activities. Thus, when a government business is commissioned to perform a social function, it is important that the commercial focus of the business is not unnecessarily blurred by its social responsibility. Conversely, it is equally important that the commercial activities of a business do not impinge on its social welfare functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the now commercialised sections of government departments formerly had policy and regulatory roles, as well as social welfare responsibilities. With the introduction of commercialisation, these policy and regulatory roles need to be removed from these businesses and transferred to other agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it was frequently quoted to the committee, it was not clear that the full implications of this principle of separating different functions had been grasped and that adequate steps had been taken to implement it. The committee acknowledges that the government's businesses now no longer have regulatory functions in areas where they compete with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the experiences of the CAA have drawn attention to the problems that can arise with the combination in the same organisation of a commercial function&mdash;air traffic control&mdash;and a regulatory function that does not have a commercial focus&mdash;air safety. The committee found that this situation has led to confusion among the CAA's clients and within the organisation itself. The committee welcomes the government's decision to establish an Aviation Safety Authority separate from the commercial arm of the former CAA, and has recommended that the government review the operation of all agencies with a similar combination of commercial and regulatory functions, with a view to separating the functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two other businesses that came to the committee's attention where the potential for a conflict between different objectives appeared possible. One such business is the legal practice of the Attorney-General's Department, which provides legal services to the government on both a commercial and public interest basis. The other business which is perceived as being caught in a conflict of interest is the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group&mdash;Auslig&mdash;with its large public interest function and a smaller commercial one. In both these instances, there may be a case for separating the functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some circumstances, it may not be possible to separate different functions. With such cases, very clear guidance must be provided on structures that can be set up to minimise conflicts of interest and to manage any conflicts that do arise. It may be appropriate at times to provide an independent review of areas where apparent conflicts of interest are causing concern. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Oversight of government businesses.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime responsibility for the oversight of a GBE's performance lies with the minister responsible for the industry sector in which that GBE operates. In carrying out this responsibility, the responsible minister&mdash;or portfolio minister&mdash;liaises closely with the Minister for Finance on the financial aspects of the GBE's performance. In this arrangement, the portfolio minister has a diverse range of interests&mdash;for example, he or she is interested in the financial performance of portfolio GBEs, sets policy for the industries in which the GBEs operate and ensures that appropriate regulation is in place. By analogy with the considerations that I have just raised in relation to the CAA, the legal practice and Auslig, it appears that such an arrangement may expose portfolio ministers to a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was interested to learn during a visit to New Zealand that, in that country, a different system for GBE oversight has been established. In the New Zealand system, responsibility for policy affecting state owned enterprises rests with a different minister from the one who is responsible for their financial performance. In fact, the New Zealand Minister of Finance and the New Zealand Minister of State Owned Enterprises are joint shareholders of all state owned enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first glance, the committee felt that the New Zealand model had much to commend it. Compared with the Commonwealth's arrangements, this model appeared:</PARA>
<PARA>.to allow more consistent monitoring of GBE performance;</PARA>
<PARA>.to promote more efficient identification and dissemination of best practice; and</PARA>
<PARA>.through their separation from policy portfolios, to enable state owned enterprises to concentrate on their commercial performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee explored these points with a number of Commonwealth agencies and GBEs and found little support for any of them. </PARA>
<PARA>.The agencies argued, with a consistent voice, that there should not be too great a focus on the commercial performance of GBEs. For example, a sole focus on commercial performance of the CAA's air traffic services might jeopardise its emphasis on safety and erode public confidence in the safe operation of Australia's air traffic services. </PARA>
<PARA>.They argued further that, with the Commonwealth's current arrangements, the strategic direction for each GBE is set by negotiation between the GBE's board and the responsible minister. This minister is said to be knowledgeable about the circumstances under which the GBE operates in a way that would not be possible for a minister who had responsibility for all GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA>.Furthermore, it was pointed out to the committee that the involvement of the Minister for Finance in GBE oversight provides a check on the portfolio ministers, and any conflict between them can be brought to the cabinet and resolved there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that at present there is no compelling evidence that major changes need to be made to the Commonwealth model of GBE oversight. While the New Zealand system of GBE oversight has worked well in that country, so too has the Commonwealth model in Australia. Government businesses, central agencies and portfolio departments all reported to the committee that they were satisfied with the way in which the current arrangements are working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to the question of whether the government should be involved in business at all. The committee accepts that it is appropriate for the government to be involved in a range of commercial activities. For example, it is appropriate for the government to operate businesses so as to provide services that are not available from the private sector and to foster the development of emerging markets. By being involved in business, the government can also maintain the sort of expertise needed to facilitate the work of the private sector through joint ventures, export enhancement and technology transfer and develop effective monitoring and regulatory regimes. The judgment of precisely how involved the government should be is difficult and is subject to change over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee notes that in recent times the government has moved to sell a number of its GBEs. In fact, that has been a matter of some debate this week. The program of asset sales is based on considerations of whether the public is best served by owning these businesses. Some of the considerations are: whether significant competition already exists in the market in which the GBE operates; whether increased market exposure would bring improved performance; whether the enterprise would benefit from those sorts of strategic partnerships and capital injections that can be negotiated in the marketplace; and whether social objectives are still dependent on public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the government's commitment to a continuing examination of its involvement in commercial activities is appropriate. I note in passing that the Auditor-General is currently conducting a performance audit into the efficiency and effectiveness of the procedures used in the sale of Commonwealth assets. Given the magnitude of the returns expected and already achieved from the asset sales program, it is important that the sales process be conducted as efficiently as possible. The committee awaits the Auditor-General's report with some interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that government businesses have greatly improved their level of performance since the introduction of commercialisation and corporatisation. There is evidence also that they are determined to improve further still. In this they will be assisted by the recommendations contained in the committee's report, particularly those which call on the government to update the operating framework for government businesses, to clearly define, cost and fund CSOs, and to avoid imposing on government businesses conflicting commercial policy and regulatory functions. A positive response to these recommendations will ensure that public business will indeed be conducted in the public interest. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As vice-chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I am pleased to support the remarks made by the chairman, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), in his tabling speech this morning. The committee's inquiry into public sector commercialisation was very broadly based and there were many issues which arose in the course of the inquiry, as the chairman explained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pay tribute to the secretariat of the committee&mdash;Grant, Sarah, Cliff and Lorraine particularly. The effort they put in was well beyond the call of duty in many instances. While I concur with the conclusions and recommendations in the report, I will make some general comments about one of the areas which has been covered by the chairman and which the committee examined. I am not quite as comfortable as the chairman is with the conclusions in relation to ministerial responsibility for the oversight of government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee notes in the report that responsibility for the overall commercialisation framework and for individual government businesses is less centralised in the Commonwealth sphere than in some Australian states and New Zealand. In New Zealand, for example, the crown company monitoring unit within the treasury oversights the planning and reporting processes for all state-owned enterprises and advises the Minister for Finance and the Minister for State Owned Enterprises, who are joint shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arrangement differs from the Commonwealth model where the shareholder for the government is the relevant portfolio minister, who consults the Minister for Finance on major matters affecting GBEs within the portfolio. The New Zealand model appeared at first glance to have some advantages over the Commonwealth's arrangements, such as allowing more consistent monitoring of GBE performance across portfolios, promoting more efficient identification and dissemination of best practice, and separation of commercial operations from policy and regulatory arms of the portfolio enabling GBEs to concentrate on their commercial performance. That, after all, is the reason they are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent evidence submitted to the inquiry led the committee to conclude that the single minister model used by the Commonwealth has generally worked well and that there is no case for changing the present oversight arrangements for Commonwealth GBEs. Personally I have a real problem on the basis of accountability with the potential for conflict of interest when the policy maker is also the regulator. Therefore I make the observation that, consistent with the evolving nature of public sector commercialisation and corporatisation in Australia, the door should be left open for ongoing evaluation of the centralised oversight arrangements operating in other jurisdictions. This would ensure that our own arrangements remain relevant over time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Certainly one of the more interesting tasks that I have had the pleasure of being involved in since coming into this place in March 1993 has been not only to be a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts but also to participate in the inquiry resulting in this report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest: an inquiry into commercialisation in the Commonwealth public sector</EMPHASIS>. It is important that the parliament, as the custodian of the taxpayers' dollars in this country, be cognisant of how those dollars are expended, how the public business is conducted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of matters for consideration surfaced in this report on the efficiency, effectiveness and appropriateness of government business enterprises, and the provision of community service obligations should be clearly identified. I do not think there is any argument from any quarter that we have reached best practice in GBEs. There certainly is room for improvement. There is always going to be room for improvement up to the point when the government makes a decision to maintain ownership of a GBE or to sell it and privatise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process that a lot of the GBEs have gone through in some departments has been quite traumatic as far as the culture of the staff is concerned. Staff may have worked in a Public Service situation for the majority of their lifetime and all of a sudden they are like rabbits in the spotlight&mdash;they are exposed to the rest of the world to see exactly how they are operating and whether they are in fact operating efficiently. A lot of people in different organisations have taken to this concept quite well and taken up the challenge, as it were; others have not. We did find that in the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two very important elements of this report that should be continually reviewed in policy settings by this government and future governments are, as alluded to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), the area of community service obligations&mdash;how they are provided and how they are funded&mdash;and the ministerial oversight of GBEs. CSOs are a very important element of government activity. That is going to become increasingly so in future years as all governments of whatever political persuasion in this country and countries around the world head down the path of corporatisation, commercialisation and ultimately privatisation of non-core activities of government however they are seen by the particular government, of whatever colour, of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the centre of all that, it does not matter who is in power; there has to be a commitment by government to identify what community service obligations are going to be provided. That is the very first element that must be put at the top of the list&mdash;the government must identify what it is going to provide. Then it must identify how it is going to provide it. If we have an agency within a line department that is providing a community service obligation and that has moved out to become a GBE, and if the government of the day wants to continue to provide that CSO, the government has to identify it and has to expose separately in that GBE's budget how it is going to be funded and how it is going to be paid for. Even to the extent that it is identified as a budget item in the Commonwealth budget, the government must identify how it is going to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So at that point there is no problem in moving on. If that GBE is then sold off to private enterprise, to the private sector, that CSO is still identified as being provided by that organisation and paid for out of the budget. It is a very important element of what is happening in public policy today, and will continue to be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important element that has been highlighted in this report is the aspect of ministerial responsibility. I did not have the opportunity to go and have a look at the New Zealand model, although we did get all the information about it. I still have an element of doubt about the evidence we received from our line departments in that regard. I note that the chairman said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee concluded that at present there is no compelling evidence that major changes need to be made to the Commonwealth model of GBE oversight.</PARA>
<PARA>That comment was made in relation to what is happening in New Zealand. Whilst I support the report, I would strongly recommend that the government continually monitor that. What has happened with the CAA is a perfect case in point of the possibility of a conflict: if one minister has the commercial responsibility, as well as the policy making or the regulatory responsibility, for a GBE, and gets into a political bind at any given point in time, certainly a conflict will arise. It is an area that must be continually reviewed. I highlight that to the government in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I support all the recommendations in report No. 336 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>. I should not finish without complimenting the staff who have supported us in putting this report together. They have done a hell of a lot of work above and beyond the call of duty. It is a very important document that will be referred to by a lot of governments in the future. I know that it will be used as a reference document by governments overseas. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;We are here today to discuss briefly the recent report No. 336 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS> relating to the question of commercialisation of the Commonwealth public sector. As a member of that committee, I would like to start off as everyone else has done before me by thanking the staff&mdash;Grant, Cliff, Lorraine and Sarah&mdash;for the hard work they have done. It was a report that I think I described once during the closing hearings as `bigger than <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ben Hur</EMPHASIS>'. The report is some 350 pages long and has taken almost two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot in the report to digest; there is a lot in there for government to take action on. I will keep my comments today to a couple of issues&mdash;one of them is not Professor Hilmer, which was often an item of discussion at the committee&mdash;which are community service obligations and government involvement in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community service obligations, as has been noted by other speakers, was a major consideration at the inquiry. Briefly, identification, funding and the costing of CSOs will be key issues as we move further down the track of commercialisation of government business enterprises, and also in some respects towards privatisation. It concerns members from all sides of the chamber, because when we are talking about community service obligations they often relate to rural and remote communities as well as to the less well off in society. It is an issue of grave concern to many of us. I have had real concerns over recent years with the movement towards greater efficiencies in government operations&mdash;which I support&mdash;but one of the impacts of that can, on some occasions, be a situation where community service obligations are, to an extent, diluted and otherwise interfered with. That can have real and lasting implications for the communities that we all come here to serve. We have got to look at that very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that we, the government and the parliament, need to work seriously and hard on the identification and the costing of those CSOs. We need to be very clear about what is being provided and what is seen to be the actual community service obligation, to ensure that that is maintained, whether it be in the private sector or in the circumstances of a commercial government enterprise. We have to make sure that those things are clearly delineated and put in a position where there is no doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If governments of any persuasion take a decision to remove or to alter those CSOs, my view and I think the view of the committee was that that should be clear and open and available for debate within the public arena. The government of the day which might do that should be judged accordingly on the basis of what it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of concern about CSOs was that on some occasions&mdash;and I think the example that many of us spoke about was Australia Post&mdash;it may well be that a community service obligation is difficult to cost and to define in a detailed fashion. Nonetheless, every effort should be made to ensure that those definitions are there and that it is recognised that they are an important aspect to be provided through these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of government involvement in business, which was one of the areas where there was some discussion on the committee, I think it is fair to say that all members of the committee agreed that there was a need for government involvement in business in particular circumstances. I guess it is fair to say also that, though there was some difference of opinion as to how far those circumstances go&mdash;I note the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) is smiling at that comment&mdash;government does play an important role in providing business opportunities. We should not allow a situation where on all occasions matters are flogged off without relevance to the real social need that some of those businesses can provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government should stay in business and provide services where they are not available from the private sector. It should assist in the development of markets, joint ventures and other involvements with the private sector and ensure that there are effective monitoring and regulatory regimes. The other issue I raise there is that it is also important in many areas for government to maintain expertise for its dealings with the private sector. For example, a necessary aspect in tendering arrangements is the need for expertise from the government in its dealings with the private sector in the provision of service. I worry a little bit on some occasions that the government is moving down a track where we are losing some of that expertise. Defence is an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the House. I congratulate the members of the committee and the staff for the excellent work that was done on this inquiry. I think it is a good study of what has been done and what can be done in the field of commercialisation. It is an area that is current and relevant to the operations of government and parliament in Australia. It can be taken on board and used to good effect for all of the community. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments proposed in the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1995 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1995 will give effect to the national heavy vehicle charges developed by the independent National Road Transport Commission to apply to vehicles registered under the federal-interstate registration scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Heads of government agreed in July 1991 to the establishment of the NRTC to develop nationally consistent charges and regulations for vehicles over 4.5 tonnes. The NRTC released its heavy vehicle charges determination in June 1992. The Road Transport Charges (ACT) Act, which gives effect to the charges in the ACT from 1 July 1995 and sets the model for other jurisdictions, received royal assent in May 1992. It is essential that inconsistent regulations and charges which continue to impede improvements in the efficiency of the road transport industry be changed to achieve a nationally uniform operating environment. While agreement has been reached by state and territory ministers on the heavy vehicle charges, some states continue to be reluctant to implement them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments will mean that FIRS vehicles registered in states where national charges have not yet been introduced will have access to the national charges. In the interests of achieving national uniformity, FIRS will apply to only vehicles over 4.5 tonnes and charges will no longer be able to be paid by instalments. Money collected from these registration charges will continue to be returned to state and territory governments for the maintenance and upkeep of roads. I now turn to the provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal amendments will remove the option to pay a registration charge based on actual distance travelled and the option to pay registration charges by instalments. Further amendments will remove the references to motor vehicle and trailer charge monitoring devices. At present these devices are used to determine the actual distance that a vehicle has travelled in order to calculate the actual distance amount. It is worth noting that reliable distance-only measuring devices are not currently available in Australia. These changes reflect the arrangements for registration charges determined through the NRTC process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequential amendments are required to the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. The proposed amendments will include the registration charges for various vehicle types as a schedule to that act. The implementation of national charges for heavy vehicles is a crucial step in the reform of the road transport industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments demonstrate the federal government's commitment to the harmonisation of heavy vehicle charges and regulations and its recognition of the importance of the road transport industry to the economy. The onus is now on the states and the Northern Territory to act on their commitment to implement the charges from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 1995</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1995 will apply the national heavy vehicle registration charges developed by the National Road Transport Commission to vehicles registered under the federal-interstate registration scheme. By implementing the national charges for vehicles registered under FIRS, the Commonwealth is honouring its commitment under the heavy vehicles agreement and promoting the harmonisation of road transport charges and regulations. This is important in facilitating efficiency improvements in the road transport industry. I now turn to the provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal amendment will provide the national registration charges developed through the NRTC process as a schedule to the act. The amendments also provide that, where a vehicle falls within two or more vehicle types for the purposes of the charges, the registration charge will be the higher or highest of the charges applicable. The amendments further provide that the amounts of registration charges may be altered by the regulations. Such an alteration must not increase or decrease the amount for the previous year by more than five per cent. The amendments are to come into force from 1 July 1995. The net budgetary impact of the amendments will be nil. This bill should be read in conjunction with the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1995. I commend both bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the federal opposition to respond to the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill, being debated cognately this morning. In so doing, I indicate from the outset that the federal opposition will be supporting the bills, for the very good reason that we believe this is an important part of the micro-economic reform of the road transport industry&mdash;a reform long overdue; a reform which will deliver considerable advantages, both financial and bureaucratic, to the road transport industry. The peak body of the road transport forum has been campaigning for these reforms for quite some years now. I believe there is a clear and substantial argument for the implementation of these reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for people to recognise that we are dealing with a series of reforms which will establish national uniformity for our road transport industry, whether dealing with registration charges, which is the subject of the debate this morning, or with uniform regulations for the carriage of dangerous goods, which we dealt with only a few weeks ago. We have made other changes to the act in this parliament over the last 12 months. The purpose of these reforms is to ensure that the road transport industry in Australia is not being overwhelmed with a whole raft of different laws that apply in different states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road transport industry has had to comply with regulations in Queensland that are different from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Because of that, road transport operators have been left with a bureaucratic maze to weave their way through in order to ensure that a truck that is legal in Queensland, as it initiates its journey to Melbourne, is not made illegal as it goes through New South Wales and into Victoria and back again as a result of all of the different rules in those states. The process we are now involved in is designed to make sure that a truck carrying an item from Brisbane to Melbourne does not have to go through three totally separate regulations. This legislation will make it easier for them and certainly will reduce cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills we are discussing today relate to registration charges for road transport operators. Looking simply at the issue of registration charges, there are winners and losers. New South Wales road transport operators will be big winners as a result of a national registration charge. If you are a Western Australian road transport operator, it could be argued that you will be a loser because the registration charge for your vehicle will go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would put it the same way the Road Transport Forum itself puts it. That is, the industry as a whole is a winner as a result of these changes taking place. As a result of all these changes taking place, for the first time in the history of this country we will have one set of charges, one set of rules and one set of regulations for the road transport industry right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales road transport operators will be advantaged by the introduction of this change. A bogie-drive tri-axle semitrailer, which would be described as the typical road transport vehicle on our highways, currently has a maximum registration charge of $8,650. This will be reduced to $4,000. So they are going to be advantaged considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australian road transport operators will be disadvantaged. In looking at the same vehicle, a bogie-drive tri-axle semitrailer, its registration costs will go up from $2,980 to $4,000. So Western Australia is quite obviously concerned about the implementation of this particular aspect of the NRTC process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I make this fundamental point: there will always be winners and losers on individual aspects of these changes. But, in my view, and in the view of the Road Transport Forum, at the end of the day every single road transport operator around Australia will end up being considerably better off. These changes being put through the parliament at present, as they have been over the past 12 months and as they will be over the next 12 months or so as further bills come before the House, will implement the philosophy of having a national road transport system with uniform laws, regulations and rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the process we are engaged in. It will make it a more efficient industry for road transport operators to work in. It will also make it fairer, because a consequence of having different regulations and standards in different states is that people have been able to rort the system. For example, New South Wales road transport operators have been able to register their trucks in South Australia at a much lower cost than the cost of registering them in New South Wales and have still been able to operate their trucks in New South Wales. They have been contributing much less to the cost of road maintenance in their state than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could be paying $8,500 to register a semitrailer in New South Wales. If you registered the same semitrailer in South Australia, you would be paying $2,980&mdash;almost a saving of $6,000. The problem then is that, once you have registered your semitrailer in South Australia, it only requires the sending of a cheque once every 12 months to have that semitrailer reregistered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, where they have been trying to do the right thing for a long time now, if a semitrailer is to be reregistered it is a requirement that it be properly checked to ensure that the trailer and the prime mover are in a proper and safe condition. That is not the case in South Australia. You simply send your cheque in and it gets reregistered. The truck could be in the worst of all possible conditions&mdash;the brakes may not work, bits and pieces could be falling off, the lights may not work. All the things that pose a threat to the travelling public could apply to that truck if it is registered in South Australia, yet it can continue to be reregistered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process will ensure that, if you are registering a truck in Australia, the same criteria, charges and rules for registration and reregistration will apply in every state. Operators will not be able to rort the system by going to a state that has a lower standard, thus destroying the safety standards that have been established in other more responsible states. That is what this whole process is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this process has had a few stumbling blocks thrown in its path. As anyone who understands the relationship between Commonwealth and state governments would realise, getting states to agree to do things in their own states that are different from what has been done in the past is not always easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few minutes ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) pointed out that there are problems with the implementation of this legislation in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory says that it will implement this legislation when every other state in the Commonwealth has. Western Australia says that it is not enthusiastic about this legislation because it means that its road transport operators will have to pay more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, after a long period of opposition to this in Western Australia, the Western Australian Minister for Transport has said, as I understand it, that he does agree with the philosophy of this legislation, that he does intend to implement it in his own state and that he is working through a process to ensure that intrastate operators in the state of Western Australia are not adversely affected financially as a consequence. It is up to him to find a legal and constitutional mechanism that enables him to do that. I am sure that, at the end of the day, Western Australia will implement this legislation. We will therefore see a uniform set of rules applying in Western Australia, as will apply in other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary failed to point out that his Labor colleagues in New South Wales are not exactly living up to the promises that they made just prior to the New South Wales elections in March. Interestingly enough, a few weeks before the elections in New South Wales, the NSW Livestock Transport Association held its annual conference. It invited to the conference both the then government minister for roads, Ian Armstrong, and the then shadow minister for transport for the Labor Party, Brian Langton. Each of them was posed the same question: `Will you or will you not implement the national registration charges as proposed by the Commonwealth government by 1 July 1995?' Ian Armstrong, the then minister for roads in the New South Wales coalition, said that they would not because they were concerned about the loss of revenues that the state would experience. However, he said that they would do it at some stage in the near future but not by 1 July. Brian Langton, representing the Labor Party, said that they would implement these uniform registration charges by 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To substantiate that case, the then Leader of the Opposition, Bob Carr, wrote to the RTF coordinator, Andrew Higginson. In his letter, Bob Carr said that the state Labor Party would implement these charges by 1 July. In his last sentence, he said that `as a first step Labor will ensure that national charges are introduced in New South Wales from 1 July 1995'. That is now not the case. Since the election of the Labor Party to government in New South Wales, it has backed away from that so-called ironclad commitment in writing made by the then Leader of the Opposition, who is now the Premier of New South Wales. It has said that the Labor Party will introduce this legislation in its own state to establish national charges if and when other states do exactly the same. It has now backed away from its ironclad commitment made in writing by the then opposition leader, now Premier, Bob Carr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary failed to point this out in his speech. It needs to be pointed out because it highlights that there is a lot of toing-and-froing in all of this. At least the Minister for Transport in Western Australia, Eric Charlton, has been consistent in his concerns about this and has done his best to overcome the problems. Over the last year or so, the Liberal and National parties in New South Wales have also been consistent in what they have been saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just seen some double-faced actions on behalf of the Labor Party in New South Wales, which is disappointing to say the least. I hope the Road Transport Forum and its members in the state of New South Wales take this cause up with the Minister for Transport in New South Wales, Mr Langton. It is quite obvious that he has seriously misled them, as has the Premier of New South Wales, on this very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other issues are worthy of mention in the course of discussing this bill before the House. I refer to the issue of fuel excise for the industry. It all relates to a system of charging the industry for the damage that it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission process has established that a user pays charge for the road transport industry would equate to the 18c per litre fuel excise which is currently collected. The industry is prepared to pay its way. It recognises that if the NRTC says that it is going to cost 18c a litre to recover the costs incurred as a result of its trucks driving up and down the roads of this country then it is prepared to pay. But the industry asks the obvious question: `What about the rest that we pay that does not go towards covering the cost of the damage that we do to the roads?' At present road transport operators are paying 32.5c per litre in fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRTC says that the industry is actually incurring a cost of only 18c per litre yet the government is charging it 32.5c per cent litre. The Road Transport Forum and the road transport operators around Australia are saying that they want the 14 1/2c difference in their pockets. They would like to see, and they would have expected to see by now, the government come forward with a proposal to charge them what it costs to operate their trucks on the road and anything in excess of that rebated to them in whatever form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road transport operators are very disappointed because the government in Canberra has not done that. They believe that they are being overtaxed and overcharged. Indeed, it is quite true that they are being overtaxed. The average semitrailer operator in Australia pays about $66,400 in taxes and charges to the state and Commonwealth governments. That has been increased dramatically since the last election. This government increased the fuel excise by 5c per litre in the 1993 budget which added something like $6,000 a year to the cost of operating an average semitrailer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite rightly, road transport operators are saying, `This is an outrage. We do not want to be charged any more than we should be charged. We believe it is fair to expect us to pay for the damage done to the roads by our trucks, but we think it is unfair to pay any more than that.' I think that is a fair argument that they put. They are still paying 14.5c per litre in excess of what it costs to cover damage done by their trucks to the road system so they are legitimately asking this question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point road transport operators make is that they would like to see more money spent on the roads. I am sure that would be the wish of everybody if we lived in a perfect world. Certainly, this government is not being fair in its outlays for roads in Australia. Some $840 million is allocated for roads in the budget released this week by the Treasurer (Mr Willis). That is half the amount the government indicated in the budget papers prior to the last election that would be allocated towards roads. It was stated in the 1992 budget papers that some $1,600 billion would be allocated towards roads. In the 1995 budget papers we find that only $840 million is allocated towards roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Road transport operators are saying to themselves, `We are paying an increased amount in fuel excise and we are paying an increased amount in charges and yet less money is being allocated towards roads.' I think this is another argument that is legitimate for them to put. Therefore, I believe the government should be addressing the matter. It is not, at present, addressing it in a way that would satisfy the road transport industry. If the road transport industry is to indicate its satisfaction with the government's performance then it would like to see this inequity&mdash;that is, the fact that it is paying more and more in fuel taxes to the Commonwealth government and getting less money back for road funding&mdash;addressed, as, indeed, most motorists would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this government came into power 12 years ago the fuel excise was 6c per litre. Today the fuel excise for leaded fuels is 34 1/2c per litre and for unleaded fuel and diesel it is 32 1/2c per litre. According to the budget papers, in 1982-83 road funding was $150 million and in 1995-96 road funding is $840 million. If we take into account the effect of inflation we can see that the Commonwealth government has got a lot more out of the motorists and road transport operators than it has returned to them for road funding. These issues need to be addressed by the government. It has not been doing it satisfactorily. I know that my colleague on the other side of the House would like to get up in a hurry&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope it is untrue for your sake but we do not want to hold you up any longer than necessary. I have two other things to say. The parliamentary secretary referred to distance measuring devices in his speech. There is no device known at this stage that we can rely on to accurately measure distance without somebody rorting the system in the process. A couple of years ago in Wollongong I attended a conference of road transport operators to which a person from New Zealand had come across. The New Zealand government had introduced a system whereby truck operators paid according to the distance they travelled. All this did was lead to a new industry developing where people illegally sold hubometers. Shonky road transport operators bought hubometers and put them in the wheels of their truck, indicating a much lower mileage than had been travelled by the truck and therefore incurring much lesser charges for the truck's operations. This is possible with any of the devices known at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have a distance measuring device for road transport operators it is possible for people to rort it. That is why in the end, I believe, charging road transport operators on a distance basis is never going to be quite fair. Honest people will adhere to it properly and pay according to the amount of distance they travel but dishonest ones will find it easy to cheat the system. Therefore it creates an inequity between honest and dishonest people that puts the dishonest operator at a financial advantage over the honest operator. This is something that the Road Transport Forum legitimately puts forward as another reason why these sorts of charges should be applied&mdash;it does away with the opportunity for people to cheat the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the discussions that have been held over time with the road transport industry the commitment has been given that these charges will be refined over time. We look forward to that process occurring. I am sure that as time goes by and we get some experience up on the clock it will be discovered that there are things we can do better in terms of these national registration charges. We may be able to do it in a different fashion that is fairer and cheaper. We may even be able to do it at a lower cost. Hopefully that will be the case. We look forward to seeing the government fulfil its commitment of refining these charges over the next 12 months and in the years ahead to ensure that it implements these things in the most efficient and equitable fashion possible. In the process the government should consult with the industry to ensure that it has chased up every possible avenue to provide the industry with the most efficient and fairest form of charges that will apply to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those things are done and we continue down this process and if Western Australia, New South Wales and the Northern Territory implement these aspects of the bill, then we will end up with a road transport industry that can look forward to lower costs, fewer bureaucratic difficulties and a more efficient system to work within. If those states do not do that, then we will have a problem on our hands that will lead to greater inefficiencies and greater costs being incurred on the industry unnecessarily. So the federal opposition, the Liberal and National parties, will be supporting this legislation because it is an important part of the micro-economic reform process. We recognise the arguments put forward by the Road Transport Forum as being valid and we will support these two bills, as we have other bills that have been put forward in this regard over the last 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the comments of the shadow minister for transport, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), in expressing support for the road transport legislation, but let me take him to task over his comments on roads. They are nice, easy words and it is a nice falsehood to peddle around Australia but your constituents in the industry are not that stupid when you talk about funding for roads. The honourable member for Hume and his colleagues know very well, as I know, that at the 1991 Premiers Conference an agreement was made on the sharing of road responsibilities. That agreement provides that every cent of the costs associated with building and maintaining the national highway system, which has since been extended considerably, is to be borne by the national government. That system functions today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs for building and maintaining other than local roads are to be borne by state governments. The costs for building and maintaining local roads are borne by local government. In the carve up of finances that are available, federal government, as I said, meets every cent of the cost of building and maintaining the national highway system. The money that the states used to get for arterial roads was transferred into the general revenue grant. That gave the states&mdash;and this is what they sought&mdash;much greater flexibility to use that money as they wished. That arose as a result of an initiative from the state transport and road ministers, not from this government. So the states have that right and that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local governments similarly receive a grant each year. It goes directly to them and is identified as being for local road use but does not require that it be used only on local roads. Again, that gives more flexibility to local government. So let us put paid to the falsehood that the member for Hume and some of his colleagues try to peddle around this country. It is a falsehood which is insulting to the intelligence of those in the industry and in government agencies who know something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a little more to say on this. When we come to arterial roads or major roads, other than national highways, states in effect have three bites of the cherry. Firstly, they have a share of general revenue that they get from federal government&mdash;and a major proportion of that general revenue from federal government is collected through excise on fuel. So they have a share of the federal fuel excise. Secondly, they now all have their own fuel franchising levy or a levy which in different ways and means they can raise on the sale of fuel&mdash;that is, their own or the equivalent of their own excise. So they have a share of the federal excise and they have their own charges. Thirdly, and additionally, they have a share of the general revenue grant from other purposes. So, with their wisdom and knowledge of state road systems, they can use as much or as little of those three sources of funds as they wish. It is their decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the honourable member for Hume and his colleges opposite that they should be talking to their National and Liberal party colleagues in the state governments, convincing them that, as state governments, they ought to be spending a greater proportion of their revenue on road building and road maintenance. My dear colleague the member for Hume understands what I am saying; he knows it is correct and smiles in agreement. But I just say to those opposite: you can peddle that line for so long, but you will run out of steam after a while and lose all credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the two bills before us&mdash;the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 1995 and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 1995&mdash;is to amend the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 in accordance with national charging and regulatory amendments being developed by the National Road Transport Commission. The acts provide the legislative framework for the federal interstate registration scheme for vehicles that are engaged in interstate trade and commerce. Those registration costs go to meet some of the costs associated with the usage and wear of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in themselves reflect the charges developed by the National Road Transport Commission and agreed to by the Ministerial Council for Road Transport. The Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993 gives effect to these charges in the ACT and sets the model for other jurisdictions to pass through complementary legislation. The changes, as proposed, are to come into effect from 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide for the removal of the option to nominate the actual distance amount as the amount of charge to be payable in respect of registration, and the removal of the option to pay the registration charge by instalments. The amendments remove references to motor vehicle and trailer charge monitoring devices used for the purpose of calculating the actual distance or actual distance amount. The amendments replace the actual distance amount and the imputed distance amount for the calculation of the registration charge with an annual registration charge set out in the schedule to the act. They also take effect from 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall&mdash;and I will refer to this again later&mdash;that, when in 1985 we brought in this landmark legislation, there was great representation from the road transport industry to have fitted to vehicles a measuring device to measure the distance travelled by a vehicle. Many did not want a flat charge. That was too hard, it was unfair&mdash;it was a charge irrespective of usage made of the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of them argued that the only fair way to do it was to have a hubometer fitted to the axle. We were assured that they could be provided in a form that would be tamper proof&mdash;that is, so no-one could fiddle with them&mdash;and that that was the way to go. We accepted that advice and yielded to it, but experience has shown that it was not the way to go. The hubometers were not tamper proof. It is like the old story with legislation in this place: immediately we legislate to correct an improper practice, another army of lawyers goes to work to find another loophole in the law. Obviously, that is what happened here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the 1991 intergovernmental agreement on road transport, the Commonwealth, states and territories agreed to the reform of heavy vehicle charges by 1 July this year. That was reaffirmed at the Australian Transport Council in October 1994. It is disappointing to note that only the ACT, Victoria and Queensland have indicated definitely that they will implement from 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the industry will continue to encourage all jurisdictions not to delay action until 1997-98, because these important reforms are needed urgently. Not only will the amendments result in more than 50 per cent of heavy vehicles achieving lower charges than they do now, but they will at last, after decades of neglect, bring in to some parts of Australia common national rules for mass and loading, common national in-service standards, common road worthiness standards and, for more latter times, improved productivity for B-doubles and other heavy vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it almost incomprehensible that, given that we started the reform of the road transport industry in 1983 and given that there was unanimous agreement between transport ministers to set up the national road freight inquiry&mdash;the industry had to be addressed&mdash;almost 12 years later some of the states are finding reasons why they should not carry out their obligations and implement the measures we set out to achieve in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that there will be sufficient public pressure to bring those states into line. We understand that there will be some changes to their financial arrangements and sources of finance, but governments have had to adapt to those changes in the past in respect of many other issues, and that is the case here. The overall benefit is so great that this country cannot afford to continue to be hampered and held back by the impediments that arise from inconsistent regulations and standards across the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1994, the ministers made a further commitment to progress with the agreement and work towards a common date of commencement. They now say that all the states and territories were not ready to implement on 21 April this year. Some progress has been made, but there is some distance to go and we have to push on with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Australian Transport Council meeting in April, ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of that package of initiatives. I have listed those key reforms that are to be implemented by July. They include the common national rules for mass and loading, the common national in-service standards, the common road worthiness standards and the improved productivity for B-doubles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I introduced the Interstate Road Transport Bill into the equivalent chamber in Old Parliament House on 11 September 1985, I said that the importance of road transport could not be overemphasised. I said that it was landmark legislation and another element in what we were developing&mdash;it was in the early stages at that time&mdash;in a national set of transport objectives. Those objectives included, firstly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the development of safe, efficient transport systems for the movement of goods and people both within Australia and in international trade&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>secondly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . providing the opportunity for all Australians to have reasonable access to transport services for employment, business, recreational and other needs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and thirdly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . implementing these aims in the most efficient and socially effective way.</PARA>
<PARA>Those objectives remain. They are even more important today than they were then. Considerable progress has been made by successive Labor governments since, but we need to have cooperation from the states and territories, because they carry out the registration and supervision of the industry in each of their respective states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to pages 21 and 22 of the May edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Truck Australia</EMPHASIS>. Far be it from me to praise performances in the past, but I recommend that article to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know that you are interested in the trucking industry. I recommend that you read those two pages. The article makes the point that we learn to speak with one voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article covers the history of the Australian road transport industry&mdash;how fragmented it was at that time and how our government helped bring that industry together. The associations were all brought to the one table. They were also brought together to the national inquiry that I referred to earlier with the state and territory governments. There was a realisation that the industry, the governments and the customers had to get together around the table to develop a better industry, to improve its performance. We are some 12 years down the track from that event. As I said, progress has been made but a lot more progress has still to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 20 years&mdash;I am partly referring to the national transport planning task force report and to the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics information paper No. 38&mdash;we have seen the domestic freight transport task in Australia more than double. It is expected to grow at a relatively fast rate. Therefore, it is essential to Australia's future progress that we accelerate the development of an integrated national transport system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That system should embrace all forms of transport&mdash;road, rail, sea and air. It is essential that we work towards that objective. That means putting aside the wasteful and, what I find, obstructive arguments about the merits of one system versus another. As a parliament we have to concentrate on the building of better relationships, linkages and interfaces between road, rail and sea. For too long we have had sectional interests hiding behind partisan debates about road versus rail, for example. The recent national transport planning task force found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the major intercity corridors, investment in rail is not expected to have any significant effect on investment needs for roads. Even if rail could capture the entire growth of intercity freight, this would delay timing of economically justifiable road projects by less than 5 years. It would reduce Australia's carbon monoxide emissions by less than 0.25% and road accidents by an estimated 0.3%.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that puts the relationships of road and rail in a better perspective. Those figures underlie the need to develop a total transport strategy with priority being given to maximising the efficiencies, the linkages and the interfaces. It is not so much the need to build more; it is more a case of making what we have work better, particularly at the interfaces where road meets rail and where road and rail meet the sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has long been the argument about road and rail, but rail has always had natural advantages arising from cargo type, quantity, timeliness and distance in about 40 per cent of the transport market. Similarly, road transport, for similar kinds of reasons, has had a natural advantage in about 40 per cent of the task. Yet decades have been wasted squabbling about competitive advantages and disadvantages in respect of the residual 20 per cent of the freight market. That diverted attention away from the overdue improvement of the 80 per cent of the transport task that was possible: the 40 per cent of rail and the 40 per cent of road. The inefficiencies of that 80 per cent are to an extent being addressed in this legislation&mdash;specifically, the 40 per cent in respect of road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable, as I said earlier, that with the passage of this legislation for interstate road transport there are still some states dragging the chain, despite having that four years notice of the need for reform and of the commencing date. Inconsistencies between states in road transport regulations will remain a major impediment to greater efficiency. As the national transport planning task force found, inconsistent regulations are both a cost burden and a source of frustration for the transport industry. To those states that are dragging the chain I say: so much for your trumpeting on the issue of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the overall issues and try to get them in proper perspective we find that there are many misconceptions about the role of transport in our economy and the nature of the transport task performed by each form of transport. Whilst this bill deals exclusively with interstate road transport, we need to look at transport as a whole to put those issues in their proper perspective. There are three ways we can look at it: on a weight basis, on a tonne per kilometre basis or on a transport sales value basis. If we look at tonnes carried, we find that, according to the report, 1,337 million tonnes of freight were moved in Australia in 1991. Seventy-four per cent of that weight was carried by road, 23 per cent by rail, three per cent by sea and 0.01 per cent by air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look at how far those tonnes were carried, we turn to a tonne per kilometre measurement. On a tonne per kilometre basis road carried 33 per cent; rail, 32 per cent&mdash;so they are about the same; there is just one per cent difference&mdash;sea, 35 per cent; and air, 0.01 per cent. Then when we turn to the dollars, the value of those transport sales, we find that in 1988-89, which are the latest figures available, the value of the transport market was $13,850 million. Road gained 73 per cent of the market; rail got 19 per cent of the market; sea, six per cent; and air, two per cent. So on the weight and tonnes carried, road clearly dominates. But they each have similar performances in the tonne per kilometre measurement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures reflect that road performs most of the shorter distance intrastate-intraregion task. The flexibility point-to-point pick-up makes road the most appropriate vehicle to use. Rail, where large tonnages over long distances are involved, has that natural advantage so it picks up its share. Similarly, air is of growing interest and importance, and sea, with three per cent of the weight or 35 per cent on a tonne per kilometre basis but only six per cent of the share of the market in money terms, has other long distance advantages and is the most energy efficient form of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, road is moving around 1,000 million tonnes of freight a year over an average haul of 90 kilometres. This is another of the misconceptions. When you mention trucks people think of big interstate rigs. But the reality is that the average haul of a truck is 90 kilometres. The interstate trucks carry an important part of our transport task but the vast majority of trucks are involved in carrying short distance cargoes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also the report showed that the market shares of each mode are affected by the ability of transport operators to build on the individual characteristics of each form of transport and make those into selling points. The basic conclusion that comes out of the BTCE report in 1994 is that the prospects for substantial change in market shares of the forms of transport is limited because each mode offers particular advantages and suits particular market segments. As I conclude on those points, I come back to the point I began with, which is that each form of transport has particular advantages. </PARA>

The amendments to the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 set out registration charges for vehicles under the federal interstate registration scheme. The shadow minister for land transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), has said that the coalition supports the passage of these bills, which I note have industry support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk a little bit about fuel taxes because, quite obviously, the motorists and the transport industry pay a substantial contribution each year through fuel taxes to Commonwealth revenue. Although the revenue to be raised by this legislation is relatively modest&mdash;an estimated $15.3 million in 1995-96&mdash;it is important to remember that these collections are just one of numerous charges that are faced by the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to paying federal or state registration charges, heavy vehicle operators are also faced with a plethora of other taxes, including tax on the fuel they use and sales tax on their vehicles.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The 1995-96 budget, the one that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) brought into this House on Tuesday evening, will continue the record of low road funding levels and is further evidence of the government's neglect of Australia's land transport infrastructure. Over recent years, the Labor administration here in Canberra has cut federal road funding from two-thirds of the fuel tax that is paid by the motorists and by the road transport industry to a mere eight per cent of total fuel tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you believe in the user-pays principle, you would have to say that there is certainly not a user-pays principle applied to taxing the road transport industry or the motor vehicles used by the families of this nation. Of course, it is just too convenient a tax to collect. The government has got fuel tax collectors at fuel bowsers all over this nation. The motorists and the transport industry have been too easily hit by this tax. We on this side of the House would like to see a fairer share of that tax revenue going back into the nation's roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Road charges and the fuel tax apply to both urban and rural based road users. However, the federal government has virtually abandoned our rural roads.

The government has abolished funding under the national arterials program, the provincial cities and rural highways program and the state arterial road program.

These communities pay fuel tax like everyone else, yet the roads they need to transport their goods to market on, the roads tourism operators need to operate on and roads needed for the safe transport of rural families are, obviously, not federal priorities under this government. </PARA>

While the government is very efficiently extracting money from the long suffering road users of this nation, it is not nearly as committed when it comes to spending that money efficiently.

Nothing could be more important from the parliament's point of view than to see taxpayers' money spent efficiently.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report was completed in December 1993. It is to the great shame of the government that there has still been no government response to this report's recommendations.

A parliamentary standing committee has reported to the parliament and we are still awaiting a response from the minister. Apparently the minister does not see it as a high enough priority to respond to a parliamentary committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's administration of untied funding for local roads is also criticised in the report. It is about time the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), whose portfolio covers untied funding for local roads, got his act together and responded to the matters that are raised in the report which affect his area of responsibility. The Deputy Prime Minister has recently issued a great many reports on urban planning and on other issues. It would be nice if he took the time to respond to these issues which are so critical. One of these is the administration of the untied funding to local roads. The Deputy Prime Minister has been very good at commissioning reports. It is obviously much easier to commission reports&mdash;spending more taxpayers' dollars&mdash;than it is to respond to those reports. I urge the Deputy Prime Minister to respond to those parliamentary committee's findings which date back to 1993. </PARA>

They are important to the people who live in rural Australia. They facilitate the safe access of families to schools.

In my own electorate of Maranoa there are many roads that are local roads, parts of national highways and parts of highways that were once funded by this federal government but have now been abandoned in relation to funding. These are roads where school buses travel daily taking the next generation of Australians safely to school&mdash;roads that are so often hazardous roads. That is why people in rural Australia place great importance on safe and trafficable roads. School and education are fundamentally important things that people living in rural Australia place a great deal of emphasis on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that the 1995-96 budget continues the Labor Party's dismal record in providing general purpose funds for local councils.

In rural Australia the drought and the current economic climate have impacted on the resources of ratepayers. They are left to fill the void that this government has created by its failure to continue to provide an adequate level of general purpose grants to local governments to enable them to share equally, or to share in a more equitable manner, the great federal tax revenue pool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at general purpose grants, we will find that, in real terms, this year's budget will return fewer dollars to local governments for general purpose grants than when the government came to office in 1983.

That figure has fallen to 0.67 per cent of total federal tax revenue in 1995-96. I think that illustrates the fact that this Labor Party is not committed to local government in this nation. It is not prepared to give local governments a fair share of the tax revenue that the Commonwealth receives annually from the taxpayers of this nation. </PARA>

It identified that savings of up to $21 million in project management and administration costs could be made. It identified savings of up to $8 million in general administration costs which could be made. It also identified savings of up to $50 million which could be made through improved maintenance techniques, and better cash management practices would also save another $4 million. The Auditor-General's report shows that there is $83 million of potential savings that could be made as a result of a more efficient use of national highway maintenance funding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just in opening my remarks, I remind the House, as I have before, of my extensive involvement in the trucking industry in the past. I established a major north-west trucking concern as a cooperative to service the consumers of the town where I then lived in Carnarvon. When I say `established', I do not want to take all the credit, because there were others involved, but I was certainly a very active participant and, in fact, provided trucks to make up the service. I was able to convince the then state minister of transport to allow double bottom road trains to operate south of Geraldton and add to the efficiency of handling freight, which is so significant to people who live away from the rail system in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am no stranger to this particular debate. I have participated in it time and again in this place. I am interested to see that we are now moving away from the various distance monitoring devices which I have criticised time and again in this place&mdash;and, might I add, to such people as the now retired member of parliament Bruce Baird, who had a total fixation on tachometers. I put them in trucks as a management tool and watched drivers manipulate them overnight so they could take the prime mover off their rig to visit their girlfriend in a town about 50 miles away. The simple fact was that they were a joke. They were not even useful as a management tool, and we had a government totally committed to them. Every time I wrote to Bruce and said, `Listen, for goodness sake save yourself and your constituent drivers some money,' I never got a reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a rather stupid fixation, which I guess in the end resides with the departments involved. When one looks at the contribution of the trucking industry to the cost of living of Australians, it is just outstanding to see how, as a sort of non-tariff barrier, certain state transport departments have used the licensing system both through the prohibition of certain licences and through stacking their costs to prevent the road transport industry from efficiently competing with state owned railways. It is all here in the documentation we were advised to read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in New South Wales, which is still to make up its mind about this particular legislation, for such an efficient vehicle as a VW&mdash;and I do not know why there is a difference on maximum mass&mdash;the licence fee can be $14,700. The recommended licence fee under this particular legislation is $5,250. For many years, certain states, including Western Australia, have charged substantially less than that&mdash;in fact, $3,530. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to look at the trucking industry and say that it is some sort of monster that goes around frightening people and beating up our roads. The other aspect of it expands rapidly with people such as those whom I represent who live in the less populated areas of Australia at increasing distances from the centre of supply&mdash;and do not think the centre of supply is necessarily the nearest capital city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a time for many decades when a firm in Western Australia called Mills and Ware produced all our biscuits in the port city of Fremantle. It was taken over by Arnotts and, after many years of operation under Arnotts' management, it has since been closed down. Today, Western Australians are more than likely to get their biscuits from Brisbane. It seems an awfully long way to cart some biscuits, and they frequently travel by roads. Therefore, Western Australians have a great interest in the cost of road transport, be it intrastate or interstate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time you increase the cost of operating a truck, it is quite clear that that cost will eventually filter through to consumers. This parliament, along with state legislatures, has an absolute responsibility to ensure that the trucking industry is not hampered by legislation to provide safe&mdash;and I underline the word `safe'&mdash;and efficient services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about road damage, there is the continuing myth that the larger the truck the greater the damage. In fact, the maximum size combination that is mentioned in this legislation, which I would refer to as a triple bottom road train where the licence fee proposed is $8,500 per annum, puts the least pressure on the road per tonne of goods moved because it is using one prime mover to shift what would be roughly three 20-tonne loads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prime mover on a semitrailer is a very substantial part of the gross weight of the vehicle. When we consider that the same weight component can be used to cart three times as much product in semitrailers that are substantially lighter, our gross mass on the road, which is what does the damage, per tonne of goods carried is less. So the larger rigs are beneficial. Of course, people say, `They're dreadful things, they frighten you and they're very hard to pass.' So are three individual semitrailers driving along the road, particularly if they tailgate, which is to be condemned. The conservationists may approve of tailgating as a fuel saving mechanism. The simple fact is that, if people in smaller vehicles get behind a large semitrailer, they will find that their foot comes back about an inch on the accelerator. The semitrailers have a huge suction capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, individual semitrailers are much more dangerous on the road than are three linked-up trailers. Of course, we need to take into account traffic density. Even in Western Australia, we need to consider that the town of Carnarvon or something of that latitude is about the level at which a triple bottom semitrailer can operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a point about these configurations. I think the current Minister for Transport in Western Australia, Eric Charlton, is to be congratulated. He occupies the upper house seat contiguous with my electorate. He is a member of the National Party. We have had our arguments from time to time, but I think Eric Charlton has carried out his duties as transport minister in a very exemplary and courageous fashion. He decided to run a trial allowing double bottom road trains to move into what one would call a metropolitan area from a break-up point, which was probably 20 kilometres outside the metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had all the locals going bad. They thought it would mean that every second motorist was going to get run over. The state government conducted a trial which eventually operated over 500 movements. I just happened to be driving in my car on the day that Mr Charlton announced that the trial had been successful and that he was going to allow under strict control the continuation of this practice. I will give you the reasons why in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Charlton made this announcement, one of his opponents, a female councillor from the Swan Council, rang up to say how dreadful it was that Mr Charlton had made this decision because she and her committee had been unable to observe the operation of these road trains. They still did not know what a threat they represented to the community. What she was really saying was that they had been operating 500 movements and she had not seen one of them. Obviously, they could not have been too dangerous to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we try to keep this rig together? I ran a business at a time when there was not such an enlightened view. We originally had to break up the road trains at the town of Geraldton, 300 miles north of Perth, and later at a point known as Muchea, about 30 miles out of Perth. It used to cost us one-third of the gross return of that extra trailer to shift it that last 30 miles. We had to pay someone to come out and do it. These blokes had to build up their own rigs or our driver who had just driven 600 miles&mdash;maybe 1,000 miles from further parts north in Western Australia&mdash;had to take one trailer into town, unload, drive back and then go through the process of hooking it all up again. We used to pay someone else to do it and it would cost us one-third of our revenues for that trailer for the last 30 miles. We had to charge someone for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason why people do their best to get these rigs as close as possible. Might I add that within this charging system there are other configurations which are nearly as long as a double bottom road train and which to my knowledge have been operating around the Perth metropolitan area for the last 30 years and no-one has even known they were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am attracted to this proposal because it attempts to give a uniform and what would appear to be a basically reasonable charge structure to all sorts of configurations. It particularly sends a message to New South Wales and, to a degree, Victoria that using licence fees as a non-tariff barrier to efficient road transport is grossly improper. Victoria made headlines when it decided that it would license B-doubles. Anyone would think they had spiked wheels and they were going to run over people. There was absolutely no argument. A B-double is such an innocuous piece of road equipment compared with a triple bottom road train. It was a joke. There was absolutely no reason in the public safety interest to say that those sorts of vehicles should not be on the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first thing is that this legislation, being nationally uniform, does contribute to reducing those costs. One of the reasons it cannot be fully implemented is New South Wales and its new government. I do not know what it is about Labor governments&mdash;they say one thing before the election and do the opposite after it. We have Mr Carr, who made an absolute commitment to this scheme, backing away from it before he said thank you to the electors for electing him. The reality is that they are doing it because they are going to lose this non-tariff barrier and, they believe, some revenue. Yet the Road Transport Forum has told them they will probably increase their revenues simply because of all those who had escaped and gone to operate a trucking business in another state where they could license at lower costs. On the east coast, with these sorts of movements, you can practically not do a delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, who have just taken the chair, would know, the traffic between South Australia&mdash;or certainly its very productive eastern areas&mdash;and the western areas of Victoria in stock carting and other things is huge. People operating large rigs on the east coast are almost by definition interstate carriers because their business is always across somebody's border. So it is very good news in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern, and it is also expressed by the Minister for Transport in Western Australia, is that the charges to be implemented are still substantially higher than those charged in Western Australia&mdash;and, I note, in the Northern Territory, which seems to have a lesser concern&mdash;and we in Western Australia are concerned about that. I have to say that the railway system we have, which is being made efficient and competitive under the Court government, is still not equipped to make those parcel deliveries. It does not, I might add, in any part of Western Australia, particularly my electorate which is totally reliant on road transport for its daily requirements. The rail system has quite properly been focused on bulk carting, which is what it is good for, and it struggles even in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to people constantly that the last time I did the figures the rail system in my electorate was shifting 1,400 tonnes of product per annum per kilometre of rail system. The iron ore operators in the north-west shift something like 80,000 tonnes of product per kilometre of their rail system. This gives some idea of how expensive rail infrastructure is in remote areas where the demand just does not exist, even when four to eight million tonnes of grain are being produced a year. It is peanuts in talking about the task that railways can accommodate and it is where the truck is more efficient, particularly when there are door-to-door type deliveries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we accept these charges, I note that the Western Australian government is still looking at its options in terms of being able to rebate some of this additional money that would be collected back to trucking operators. This would not be for trucking operators but for their consumers. I say to anybody who suggests that the road transport industry pockets all these little paybacks that the industry is just so competitive that it is difficult even for owner drivers to make a living. There is no doubt that they are working at the margin&mdash;and the most competitive margin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, we have got a situation where any substantial increase in licensing fees for trucks would affect the consumers in my electorate. When one looks at the vastness of Western Australia and the distances involved in serving the great mining communities in our north-west, then the cost is very significant. It has got to be resolved. Basically, I think everybody recognises the advantages of uniformity, particularly in allowing the most efficient rigs to operate within states and to have them all marked out, as they are here, so nobody can have special rules for special vehicle combinations. That is the advantage of this arrangement, but it cannot be allowed to damage the welfare and the financial viability of businesses throughout Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard, I also support the remarks of the previous speakers from this side. They complained bitterly about the inadequate amount of money that is being provided from the federal coffers for road construction within Australia. Road infrastructure is and will remain a responsibility of the government. It is an infrastructure that services people in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me point out the contribution of Western Australia to the national export economy. Somewhere less than 10 per cent of the population is producing about 30 per cent of the country's export income and a huge percentage of GDP relative to numbers. Therefore, it is very important that Western Australians be encouraged to continue to carry the less productive sectors of Australian society in this day and age. Road infrastructure is one of their major requirements. It is silly to keep saying that the providers have to pay for it when they are returning such a massive dividend to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a more general sense, licence fees are an appropriate way of contributing to road infrastructure. In rural or remote areas, road infrastructure is primarily a transport service. Within metropolitan areas it is a convenience. There are too many vehicles on the roads on certain days of the week, and that puts massive demands on the cost of roads. In a metropolitan area, narrow roads are not sufficient, and so there are flyovers and, in more densely populated capital cities, one road built on top of another. That is a lot more expensive than getting out the grader and flattening a bit of bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of that situation is that people who want a three-car garage&mdash;we are going past the two-car garage&mdash;have to pay an up-front fee for the services that are put there, whether or not they use them. I live in a house in the metropolitan area. The bit of road outside my property was completely rebuilt recently. It was designed in such a way that it cannot be used effectively because it has roundabouts and everything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of things are very expensive, yet they mean that a truck cannot get down the road&mdash;and that access might just be handy from time to time for the delivery of furniture or whatever. These things would have cost a fortune on a per kilometre basis, yet they only service 20 or 30 motor cars, some of which only come out of the garage on a Sunday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vehicle licensing, particularly of the `family car', is something that should be structured on the basis of the infrastructure that has been created and which might seldom be used by those vehicles. It is sensible that that be done. On the other hand, trucks are out on the roads every day of the week. They use the roads all the time and they pay fuel tax on a minute-by-minute basis, practically 24 hours a day&mdash;certainly 20 hours a day. That is the component that is not being returned in sufficient quantity. That tax was originally introduced for the purpose of building our roads and our road infrastructure. It has become a major point of collection. It is downright foolish in the context of Australia to tax transport at the levels we do. We only fine our own producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, you have heard of this example. Orange juice from your district is transported on a truck that pays $2,000 a week in collective taxes, while your Brazilian competitors bring the stuff in by international sea transport at no such tax levels and dump it right on the doorsteps of Melbourne and Sydney. The people you represent have to transport 700 kilometres by taxed road to achieve the same thing. It is no wonder they are struggling to compete in an international context. </PARA>

It was intended that the tax&mdash;payable by certain persons who obtain a visa having previously been unlawful in Australia&mdash;would act as a disincentive for people to become unlawful for long periods.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995, I find it extraordinary that we have had before the parliament this year legislation on migration on five separate occasions. Again, we are making quite substantial amendments to the legislation in this area. I am sure all of us who considered Senator Robert Ray's codification of the Migration Act would never have contemplated that legislation dealing with migration entry to Australia would assume the complexity and difficulty that one often associates with taxation laws of this country. I want to take the opportunity to deal with several matters in order. Each of them is quite separate and will be dealt with separately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue relates to amendments to detention procedures, as was made clear by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio). The amendments that we are dealing with arise from the consideration of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS>. It was not the first occasion on which the committee on migration had dealt with matters associated with detention. The committee first had given consideration, in one of its earlier reports, to the whole question of refugee entry and the unauthorised entry into Australia of asylum seekers. Of course, in the committee report where these matters had been addressed previously, a very considered rationale for the regime of detention was made explicit. It was asked that the matter be addressed again at the beginning of this parliament, and that is why we had the joint committee examine the issue of detention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to consider the particular amendments that are before us in the context of the committee's very detailed examination of this issue. If the second reading speech&mdash;which is really quite brief&mdash;perhaps coupled with the explanatory memorandum and speeches that might be made in this place, gives some guidance as to the way in which the particular provisions in this act are to be considered, then one might very well get an unbalanced view of the way in which this matter has been addressed. I want to take this opportunity to draw attention to the committee's very severely circumscribed set of proposals which the government has adopted for dealing with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that we are dealing with are designed to deal with a very narrow range of circumstances, to provide relief for those people who have been dealt with harshly as a result of clear and manifest administrative failure. The non-compellable discretion that is being given to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in a certain very specifically prescribed set of circumstances was developed in this form because the committee believed that there was a clear rationale that should&mdash;subject only to these exceptions&mdash;always be followed for detaining unauthorised border arrivals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report sets out very clearly in chapter 4 the rationale for detention of border arrivals. At the beginning of that chapter, certain evidence that was given by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was quoted with approval because the point that needed to be understood was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . consideration of the question of detention cannot be seen in isolation from related matters of entry processing, entry controls and the whole cycle of processing people seeking entry and stay in Australia which, of course, includes the removal or deportation of those who cannot sustain claims. Our approach to each of these impacts needs to be clearly balanced, including the way in which each element impacts on the other if an effective and efficient approach is to be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA>The rationale and discussion went on to make it very clear that this was not a punitive measure but was a measure designed to ensure that the efficacy of our system of migration entry is to be maintained. The committee reviewed the experience of Australia in dealing with asylum seekers and border arrivals, and it dealt with the difficulty in locating and removing failed asylum seekers. I wanted to put before the House a quote which, again, comes from the department. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's experience in the past in locating and removing failed asylum seekers does not lead us to a sanguine view of the level of compliance we can expect with the requirement to depart once the decision making process had been exhausted, nor for that matter does the experience of other countries. For these reasons, I am not satisfied that an alternative approach to that now applied would work.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a situation where, if we are going to be able to effectively deal with the issue of unauthorised border arrivals, if we allow those people to enter into the community we cannot then expect to be able to write to them later and ask them to turn up. We cannot expect that, if they fail our tests for asylum, they will simply present and say, `We are happy to go now.' The experience is quite to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report details all of that. We canvassed the arguments in favour of detention, particularly on the issues of entry control; the arguments against mandatory detention; and the question of how long people should be maintained. We looked at a whole set of issues relating to various mechanisms and conditions for release. We looked at arrangements that might be otherwise used, including bonds and sureties. We looked at community sponsorship schemes and at the experience abroad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very conscious that here in Australia we have water borders which make control much easier. The numbers  entering Australia are such as to make it possible for people to be taken into detention and maintained with a reasonable expectation that the costs will not be unmanageable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked particularly at situations in places like the United States, where they have attempted to put in place release programs. People build up very high expectations as to the way in which these programs might work. But our review of the experience in relation to the operation of pilot projects, particularly in the United States, was that they were only appropriate given the very special circumstances operating in America, where they had much larger numbers than we do, or where they were dealing with people whom, very often, we would allow into the community and deal with in the ordinary way. I refer to people who enter Australia legally, have visas and later mount claims for refugee status. In the main, that is the same situation that they were trying to deal with in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our ultimate concern in this matter is that we need to have a rational and sensible detention policy. We should recognise the wide range of circumstances that people face when they come to Australia. We should be capable of properly assessing the claims of people who are in need of protection, and be able to quickly accommodate them and settle them in Australia. Coupled with that, we need to have the capacity to remove from Australia, quickly and sensibly, those people who are trying to manipulate our compassion, where there is no bona fide reason for accepting that they have a need for protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee mounted some criticisms of the way in which the department of immigration, coupled with the involvement of the courts, had handled a lot of the early asylum claims. We recognised that people had been detained for very long periods of time. We did not regard that as being satisfactory. The committee's view was that we must have prompt decision making. I want to draw attention to a couple of comments from the report, because it is important that the committee's rationale be on the record and understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering issues relating to the most appropriate border detention regime, the committee said that Australia does have a sovereign right to determine who may enter and the conditions under which people are able to settle in Australia. The committee came to the view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That those who arrive in Australia without authorisation or with invalid authorisation should be detained upon arrival. To do otherwise would compromise Australia's system of immigration control. In addition, detention of unauthorised arrivals ensures that the community is not exposed to unknown or undetected health or security risks. In the Committee's view, Australia's immigration control system must be upheld and it is important to ensure that immigration to Australia cannot be achieved simply by arrival.</PARA>
<PARA>We went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inquiry, there was general agreement with the principle of detaining unauthorised arrivals while their identity and background are determined, and to allow lodgment of their claims to enter and remain in Australia. The consensus in submissions was that detention in such circumstances is appropriate, with two to six months being the suggested time frames. It was the need to extend detention beyond a relatively short time frame which was challenged by community and advocacy groups.</PARA>
<PARA>It was in that context that the committee came forward with this very specific set of proposals which recognised the need for fair and expeditious processing of applications, that litigation should be minimised and that unauthorised border arrivals who claim that they are refugees should have prompt determination of their claims, including administrative processing, administrative review and any legal appeals. We proposed that that ought to be done within six months but, in cases where that was not possible, where people were held beyond six months, that the minister be given a discretion&mdash;a non-compellable discretion; I make that very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said that the minister would have to consider very specific matters, including age, health, and experience with torture and trauma, which would allow for release. Health, character and security checks would need to be satisfied. The likelihood of somebody absconding is an important issue that has to be addressed, as are the extent to which people have been timely in pressing their own claim for refugee status, the extent to which they have cooperated with the department in considering their claims, and whether or not adequate support arrangements would be available if they were released into the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also said that Australia's international obligations have to be considered. We set down very specific provisions that we believed ought to be followed in relation to bridging visas: the requirement for people to report regularly, to reside at a nominated address, to notify the department if there were any changes, and to depart, or present for removal, if they were refused refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I offer those comments to give force and effect to the nature of the recommendations that were brought forward and to ensure that those who look at these matters are very conscious of the view of the parliament on this matter as expressed by its parliamentary committee. Anyone who has any doubts and who in reviewing these matters might try to push the minister should be aware of the extent to which the parliament has a view that these matters need to be very carefully controlled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been made clear that the joint committee is conducting an inquiry into the migration agents registration scheme. It is considering its draft at this stage. The bill lifts for one year the sunset clause that had been included to ensure that there was a review of this matter. We think that the proposals here are reasonable. The scheme has been operating for only 2 1/2 years and the jury is out on its adequacy and effectiveness and the need for such a scheme. The report is something that the government obviously needs to have in considering the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue relates to, I guess, departmental convenience in the issue of passenger cards. The passenger card is one of the security measures used to protect our borders. People have to fill it out when they are entering or leaving Australia. The act now specifies the questions that have to be asked in relation to a citizen's health, criminal record, purpose of visit, unpaid debts and other matters. The bill is designed to remove those very prescriptive requirements and to give the department carte blanche, subject to publication in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, as to the form that these new passenger cards might take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Short in another place has sought information from the department about the way in which the department envisages these matters being addressed. Obviously, there is some sensitivity about passenger cards and the nature of the questions that are asked. I imagine the parliament might be very well concerned if future tourists to Australia, and Australians coming and going, when filling in passenger cards were asked questions relating to health. I am only surmising what issues might be addressed, but, with the concern about AIDS, a question could be asked about sexual preference. I would want to see the parliament consulted about any passenger card dealing with such a sensitive issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that at the moment there is no requirement for this matter to be referred back to the parliament. Before this matter is concluded in another place, we will be seeking advice as to whether or not it is envisaged that the notice that is to go in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> would in some way be covered by the Disallowable Instruments Act and be a matter that would require further parliamentary review. If it is not, and the nature of answers to questions that my colleague in another place puts gives us reason for concern, then this is a matter that we may want to press in the other house. It really depends to a degree upon the extent to which departmental officers are able to complete the briefing, which I understand has not yet been concluded, on these particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the repeal of the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act extraordinary. The act was designed to have provisions in place to give people some encouragement, incentive, to come forward at an early stage and regularise their status. Also, we decided to put a tax on them for each year that they delayed coming forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the department now tells us that it has become apparent that this intention has not been achieved through this amendment to the tax act. In fact, what it has probably done has been to put off people from coming forward, and it has probably led to Australia's being host to many more illegal immigrants than might have otherwise been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill now seeks to repeal retrospectively the tax act. It says that any tax that has already been collected will be refunded to the taxpayer. I am not sure that that is an appropriate term for somebody who has been an illegal entrant but, nevertheless, it will be refunded. The advice we have received from the department is that nobody has yet paid this tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament was put to the trouble of legislating in this area, with certain assumptions being made in relation to behaviour, by people who were long experienced in these matters. It is extraordinary that these people did not know that the legislation might have adverse consequences and achieve an objective which was diametrically opposed to that which they were seeking to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find the arguments in support of this quite unconvincing, and I daresay my colleague in another place will press this issue. It does reflect on the nature of the advice that the government has received in this area if it seriously believed that this would work. We were asked to accept it in good faith and the experienced people who offered this advice now tell us, `We have got to take it away.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matters relate to the Immigration (Education) Act. People would know that the large number of asylum seekers who sought protection in Australia after the Tiananmen Square massacre, and many others from other parts of the world, who ended up in queues to lodge applications for protection was very much an outcome of the way in which the government handled these matters, and particularly the involvement of a former Prime Minister in the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the last election, the government had left open the question of what might happen with unresolved asylum seeker cases, particularly the large number of students who were given preferential rights to protection in Australia without substantial inquiry as to the nature of their claims&mdash;which is what happened after the Tiananmen Square massacre. As the situation had gone on for years where the government failed to address the issue, we saw in November 1993 certain decisions taken to regularise the status of those who had been dealt with in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced in 1993 that it would provide access to permanent residency in Australia for the PRC nationals who were here at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, that being under class 815 entry permits; certain better qualified asylum seekers and nationals from Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia who were temporarily resident in Australia, provided they met certain criteria, that being under class 816; and some highly qualified students undertaking postgraduate studies in Australia, under class 818 permits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain criteria were set down for those applications, which people had to meet. All applicants were required to meet health and character standards. Under the 816 and 818 conditions all principal applicants had to be aged less than 45 on that date, they had to be visaed to travel on or before 12 March 1992, they had to enter Australia before 1 November 1993 and they had to have sought refugee status, or Sri Lankan or former Yugoslav humanitarian temporary entry permits, before 1 November 1993. In addition, the class 816 applicants needed to meet English language and post-secondary education standards and the 818 applicants needed to have postgraduate qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the two classes that we are talking about&mdash;large numbers of students seeking to regularise their status and people who would not normally have qualified for migrant entry, being granted concessional entry to Australia in circumstances in which others would fail and so getting a significant advantage, and being allowed through the door. Yet all we said was that they had to meet certain English language or certain educational standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just say about those who hold postgraduate qualifications that in order to get those qualifications they have to meet certain English language tests. So the English language tests essentially apply to both groups. We ask the class 816 students to come forward and be tested, and presumably we pass them. We have had a whole lot of students who have got postgraduate degrees and have passed the test in English, and what do we find? After they have been through that, they apply for and have a statutory entitlement to 510 hours of free English language tuition at the taxpayers' expense. How is it that people that the government has tested are able to access free English language courses? Why do they need it? What is the competency of the people who test them and allow them to enter and to stay&mdash;unless it was done with a nod and a wink&mdash;if they demonstrate a need still to come back and get free English language tuition? What does it say about the department? I do not like to blame departments for these matters. What does it say about the government that made these decisions that the department had to administer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, what we are doing is now repealing an entitlement to free English language tuition. We are told that 100 people have already accessed such classes. Presumably, some who are already part of the way through their courses might have their access now revoked when this is passed, but we are also told that they will not be required to refund the cost of the course. I find the whole thing inexcusable, and I am sure other members of the parliament see it likewise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reflects very much upon the way in which the government rushed these matters through and the way in which it did not consider the consequences of its decision to allow such entry. It also says a great deal about the way in which the tests were carried out if, as I said before, those people who were being tested&mdash;and who had to demonstrate that they had adequate English language competency to be able to stay&mdash;achieved a pass, but were then able to establish that they needed further English language tuition in the special programs that we have for new arrivals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Migration legislation is important and there are some outstanding issues that have to be resolved, particularly in relation to the passenger card, as I mentioned. When this legislation is considered in another place, we will flag whether or not further amendments might be necessary. In the main, the bill does not meet with any opposition and, in this place, we will accede to its passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As indicated by the previous speaker, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), this legislation is largely supported by the opposition. The first measure follows from the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS> in February 1994. I had the privilege, with the member for Berowra and other members, of being part of that investigation, which not only heard a significant number of witnesses but also had the opportunity to visit detention centres at the airports, Villawood and Port Hedland. With the exception of a minority report&mdash;from recollection, by one senator&mdash;the committee did come to a common position on these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the consistent campaigns by a number of church groups, welfare organisations and a significant sector of newspaper commentators who take an interest in this policy area, the committee did come to the conclusion that any release from detention should be very strictly limited, and the member for Berowra went through a number of those qualifications which the committee suggested should govern any action by the minister to allow release, because the committee was of the view that people advocating a very liberal approach to release of detained illegals were unrealistic in their analysis of what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such people came before us with concepts such as that we should let people out on bail or on bond, et cetera. The reality out there is that large numbers of people who are going through our refugee process do not give a stuff about the requirements of our legal system. They essentially want to stay here regardless, and experience has shown that very few of them wish to participate in that legal process once they start getting bad news. According to a statistic cited on page 153 of that report, 27 per cent of people do not seek a review of the decision once they receive the first negative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we have from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who was operating&mdash;as is indicated&mdash;from suggestions of the committee itself, is a very restricted area of release. It entails that it should not be reviewable, that it should not be compellable; the minister does not have to release these people and he cannot be compelled by the courts. But there is a degree of parliamentary oversight in so far as there is a requirement for a tabling of those decisions when he does make them.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement also means that it is a prescribed type of person, and there must be a degree of departmental responsibility in what has led to the prolonged period of detention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, essentially, the granting of the bridging visa is very much constrained by the parliament's and the government's view that the public interest demands that in large the detention policy be continued and that it be based on sound public interest grounds. So the first provision in this legislation is that after a period of six months the minister has the right to release a number of people if he so chooses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to some of the conclusions of that committee in this area, it also said at page 152:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Committee's view, sufficient consideration has not been given by community groups to the varied and significant costs which would be associated with supporting persons in the community, particularly if that support was required over a long term. Such costs not only would comprise the basic costs of food, clothing and accommodation but also would include capital and maintenance costs . . .</PARA>
<PARA>One of the points of concern of the committee was that all these groups who were running around saying we should release everyone after five minutes were really not so keen to come forward themselves and say that they would financially look after these people if they were released. They were essentially saying that the Australian taxpayer should do it. So that was one of the matters that affected the committee's conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, at page 153, the committee&mdash;and I have mentioned this briefly before&mdash;was concerned with absconding, and that is the reason it has been basically in support of detention with very restricted early releases. The thrust of the committee's view is on page 153 in paragraph 4.172 where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a high rate of absconding amongst unauthorised border arrivals would result in unauthorised arrival being perceived as providing ready access to long term entry. Such a perception would undermine Australia's system of immigration control. Without any significant evidence to suggest that absconding would not be a problem, and indeed current evidence to suggest that Australia already has a substantial problem with persons who are in the community and who did not depart Australia after being refused refugee status, the Committee is not convinced by reassurances that absconding is unlikely to arise or that, if it did arise, it could be overcome through the use of community support networks.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee then went on to look at the kinds of things that should be considered with early release: whether the applicant had a special need on the basis of age, health or previous experiences such as torture and trauma; whether the applicant had satisfied appropriate health, character and security checks; the likelihood of absconding; reasonable basis for the applicant's claim for refugee status, et cetera. So that is the first part of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of migration agents is under current investigation by the committee, and it is fair to say that, whilst there is a largely bipartisan approach in this area, there is probably a different emphasis on the different sides of the House. I for one would be very supportive of the continuation of the regulation of migration agents. Analysis has shown that this area has been subjected to a large amount of fraud because people who are very desperate will do anything to stay here. If lawyers or others who operate in this migration agent area say to those people that for $10,000 they will fight their case and win, those people are prepared to pay anything. Quite frankly, in those circumstances one would not blame them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the committee is still discussing the matter. There is a wide variety of questions: whether the current legislation has reached a point where it actually works against migration advice groups and community non-profit organisations; and whether they have been hit too hard in the requirements to actually get their staff regulated. People have to travel many kilometres these days to get staff. There is also the issue of whether, in attempting to counter fraud, deception and ineptitude in the industry, we may have hurt some groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question is whether we establish funds which are similar to those in the ELICOS area. In that case, people offering English classes to foreign students have to pay into a fund to protect people against companies going down the chute. Similarly, in this situation there is a question of whether we should set up funds to protect people from a person being debarred from the industry. Apparently, there are loopholes in the current legislation which mean that, once registered, agents cannot give advice to individuals, but they can give advice to family members. There is also the issue of giving advice to people overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of issues in this area. At the moment, both sides of the House disagree on the substantial point of the legislation in this particular area. In the case of the government, the emphasis is on saying that this area needs strong regulation; that there is a need to deal with the problems in the area; and that this legislation is merited by the experience of refugee groups and various claimants. On the other hand, there is probably a view on the opposite side of the House that over-regulation does nothing. The compromise is for the current sunset clause, which would have ended this legislation on the regulation of migration agents in September 1995, to be extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the question of English language classes for people such as those who stayed here because of events in Tiananmen Square, people from the former Yugoslavia and people from Sri Lanka. As has been noted by the honourable member for Berowra, that is of concern. Essentially, we are offering status in this country to people who supposedly have a certain level of English ability. That is one of the reasons why we are taking them in. We are not taking them in because they necessarily have any other characteristics, but mainly because they come from countries that did have, and which continue to have in some cases, significant internal problems leading to discrimination, murder and torture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time we said that we wanted these people to have some English language qualifications. However, what we have now is a situation where apparently, out of 6,000 people, some 432 have offered themselves for English courses. Those classes are costing about $1,000 per term per person&mdash;and that is the cost to the Australian taxpayers. So there is, indeed, a loophole that must be closed with regard to these people having access, as visa cases, to English classes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the government acts, as it is now, there is a threat that more people will access the system. The cost of those classes so far, just for two terms, is theoretically around $860,000. That is a significant sum. It has been estimated that if you took the average number of people accessing English classes as are in the groups admitted so far, then another 280-odd would be accessing this government and taxpayer largesse. As I say, it is necessary to do something about this loophole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument that some of the people who were admitted because of their tertiary qualifications actually went through courses that did not require the same level of English as was required in the testing for access under this visa system. There is a substantial problem there. It is preposterous that those people, whom the Australian public let in through a fairly liberal&mdash;by international standards&mdash;refugee humanitarian policy, are doing that. As the member for Berowra has commented, to some degree the admission of the Chinese was a departure from Australia's general line of non-discriminatory refugee policy. It is the third significant departure. There was the Lebanese concession, the Vietnamese boat people, and now the Tiananmen Square group. They have all been substantial departures from our policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people were given the advantage of not being individually examined. They were given an advantage which large numbers of other people around the world would have liked to have had. Despite this advantage, we now have a large number of these people deciding that Australians can pay for their English classes. I commend the decision of the government to make sure that this loophole is closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter worth considering briefly is passenger cards. I find it difficult to swallow the view that we have to be too concerned about the intrusiveness of the Australian public in regard to people filling out forms. There is apparently a concern that we are in some way invading the privacy of the passengers coming to this country. Whilst we must be mindful of the reality that tourists get less attracted to a place if they are hassled too much, there is also the argument by the department that many of these questions are answered when they fill out the original visa application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would not want to put too much emphasis on the argument that we should in some way be worried about being too intrusive when we are asking a group of people about criminal matters and carrying out health checks. In some cases, there could be changes in those circumstances since the time they filled out their visa application. The opposition has said that it has some concerns about the possible extension of the provision in this regard. That is an aspect of the legislation that the government will have to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst on the question of privacy, I want to briefly talk about the decision of the High Court in the Minister of State for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Teoh. This is typical of the issues creeping into this policy area. The High Court is seemingly of the mind to take on the role of the elected representatives of this country. I would be the last one to decry our signing international conventions, but it does seem that once we sign some of these conventions the High Court manages to put very contrived arguments which extend the original intention of this country when it signed those conventions. At times it goes well beyond what I think would be the commonsense view of the purposes of those treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case involves the deportation of a person who was found guilty and convicted of a number of drug offences. The High Court came to the conclusion that the decision maker had not put enough emphasis on the future of the children. We really should question whether Australia should be held to ransom by this sort of contrived, extended argument by the High Court that, because we have signed an international convention for the prevention of cruelty to children, that allows some guy convicted of a variety of drug offences to stay in the country because his children might be affected by his having to leave. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has been critical in recent times of similar decisions by this court. The High Court stated in this case:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ratification by Australia of an international Convention is not to be dismissed as a merely platitudinous or ineffectual act, particularly when the instrument evidences internationally accepted standards to be applied by courts and administrative authorities in dealing with the basic human rights affecting the family and children.</PARA>
<PARA>For the High Court to hold this country to such an extended requirement of administrative decision making is absolutely ridiculous. When we look around the world and see the large number of other signatories to these sorts of conventions and the way they operate, it is really going too far to say that that in some way binds us to keep every drug dealer in Australia if their children would in some way be affected by their deportation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate my support for this legislation. It seeks to give a reasonable right to the minister to release early from detention some very specified and restricted classes of people. It is pleasing to see the legislation closes loopholes in regard to access to English courses in this country by people who quite frankly, on any objective analysis, should not be accessing those courses. It covers a few other matters of a minor nature and those provisions are largely supported by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995 and commend my colleague the member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) on raising the matters that he did. I begin by taking up the issue he raised at the end of his contribution&mdash;the determinations of courts and people using the rights they might have acquired and taking those rights to the nth degree. I recall some years ago that we needed to change the citizenship act. Honourable members will remember, and I am sure the honourable member for Reid will remember, that those of us with electorates with large ethnic communities used to have occasions often where people would come to Australia on a visitor's visa, overstay the visa, disappear or whatever and make a claim to stay in Australia. In the meantime they would have a child born in Australia. In those days you could acquire citizenship by birth in this country whether or not your parents were citizens or permanent residents. So the child would become a citizen, the parents would be prohibited illegal immigrants and the advocates would go around claiming that the parents should be given permanent residence on the basis that if they were not the rights of the child who was born here, whose parents were the illegal immigrants and who was now an Australian citizen by birth, would somehow or other be interfered with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a lot of soul-searching the government changed the law to provide that you only acquired citizenship by birth if one or other of your parents was either a citizen or a permanent resident. That was a loophole that we had to close. I agree with the member for Reid that often the courts, when looking at some of these cases on a one-by-one basis and not being aware of many of the rorts and ramps that are used by people attempting to stay in this country, tend to take a far too benign view of what people's rights are. Neither the member for Reid nor I would want to deprive people of their rights but you also have to consider the rights of all those other people who apply to come to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every year we get over a million applicants. We take about 100,000. So one in 10 actually gets from the beginning of the queue to the end of the queue on the other side of the customs barrier at an airport around Australia. If we are going to find these people who come into the country with the intention of trying to rort the system, then the government and the courts should come down very heavily on them. Their rights have to be balanced against the rights of all those decent people who applied, failed to have their application accepted and then accepted that. The ones who turn up here and then demand that we do something for them are a bit beyond the pale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who prey on those people are also being considered in this legislation. Part of this bill before the House involves the migration agents registration scheme, which was introduced in 1991 by the then minister, Gerry Hand, following a number of complaints by members both in this House and to the minister himself. As the minister foreshadowed at the time, the migration agents scheme is now being reviewed by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. As a result of that review, this bill seeks to extend the time in which agents can register because, as members will recall, there was a sunset clause in the bill which would have had effect in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members here will recall that I have long been an advocate of the rights of migrants who, being new to this country and sometimes with poor English language skills, are a particularly vulnerable section of our community. In particular in the past I have been concerned by the operations of certain disreputable people in the migration agents industry. I should add at this point that those people are few, a minority in an otherwise very professional industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, back in 1985, as the chair of the caucus immigration committee, I drew the attention of the House to problems surrounding the operations of migration agents and the need for some form of regulation. I reiterate: the crooks in the industry are few but their impact has a far-reaching effect and, in some cases, causes irreparable harm to people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time and since I have had many people come to me after finding that their applications either had not been lodged by these so-called agents or had been lodged incorrectly and they had been charged exorbitant fees. Finding sometimes that they were illegal residents in this country, these people, in their desperation and naivety, handed over even more money to these disreputable agents&mdash;people like the notorious Solan Baltinos, who formerly lived at Burwood and ran a very shonky organisation called the New Settlers Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members will recall that in 1989 in this chamber I named Baltinos and detailed some of his exploits&mdash;and exploits they were. Mr Baltinos was particularly adept at taking people's money but doing nothing for them. I said that Baltinos was `a person to whom the old Australian term "bludger" would certainly apply'. He was a bludger then and I have to say he is a bludger now. If ever there was a bludger in Australia, it is Solan Baltinos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were revelations in the press that Baltinos took donations from people, knowing that he could not do anything for them, of between $475 and $1,300 or $1,400. He made promises that he could get them permanent residence status&mdash;promises he was never able, or indeed never intended, to fulfil. One article in the press revealed that Mr Baltinos flaunted gold bars and wads of cash, and boasted to his son of his ability to get migrants' money `before their tears had turned cold'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His son revealed in an interview a conversation with his father in which his father said, `Remember this, Nick&mdash;get the money off them before the tear dries in their eye. Desperate people find the money. If they haven't got it, they'll go to brothers-in-law or parents. They'll get the money. They'll find it. Don't you worry. You can ask them for anything.' It is exactly the type of pariah that Mr Baltinos was that the migration agents registration scheme now protects new migrants from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central feature of the scheme, as it was set up, is the complaints mechanism backed up by the powers vested in the board to issue warnings, to suspend or deregister agents and to refuse applications for registration. This mechanism provides protection for clients by ensuring that agents who do not meet professional standards are excluded from practising commercially. I understand that Mr Baltinos was such an up-front person he was never stupid enough to apply. The old adage we used to see in shops, `Don't ask for credit because refusal will often offend,' would certainly have applied to Mr Baltinos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's principal objective in setting up the scheme was to improve standards of professional conduct and quality of advice in the migration agent industry. The establishment of the scheme recognised at that time that the industry was insufficiently organised to make full self-regulation a feasible option. Can you imagine garbage like Baltinos attempting to regulate himself? The scheme was established after extensive consultation and work with the industry, voluntary migration agencies and the legal profession. The concept of a `partnership' with the industry is the underlying philosophy of the scheme, and is reflected in its development, structure and operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From September 1992 to the end of September 1994, 2,517 people had applied for registration and applications were being received at the rate of about 40 a month. Of those, 40 were withdrawn, 169 were refused, 65 did not renew their registration, seven were invalid and one applicant was deregistered. From the 169 applications refused registration, 149 had been refused because they lacked sound knowledge of migration procedure; four were refused because they were not people of integrity; 11 were refused for both of those reasons; and five were refused because they did not meet threshold criteria, such as being an Australian citizen. The number of agents at the end of September 1994 stood at 1,692, with 166 applications under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central feature of the scheme was the introduction of a complaints mechanism to provide protection for clients to ensure action could be taken against agents whose poor advice or whose professional standards were unacceptable. Included in that is the criterion of overcharging for services performed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many members in the past would have dealt with some of these agents before the industry was regulated. Indeed, some members of the legal profession took exorbitant amounts of money from people but did nothing more than write one letter for them and then send them along to see their federal MP or senator, who actually did do the job of trying to achieve what these people wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the complaints mechanism is one of the most important parts of this legislation. It is complemented by the opportunity for people to lodge objections before the registration of an agent can take place. All complaints against registered agents and those who apply for registration are referred to the Migration Agents Registration Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the scheme and how it operates are currently under review by the joint standing committee, there can be no doubt in my mind that it is working well to ensure that the Solan Baltinoses of this world are not able to prey freely on the very vulnerable people whom we are all in this parliament to represent. I think the legislation has worked well. When the committee reviews the legislation, I think it will come to the view that the legislation was very much needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend these amendments to the House. I thank the House for the opportunity to make some comments on what I see as a very important piece of legislation that was introduced some time ago in an attempt to register migration agents. I hope that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), when dealing with the review that is done by the committee, will ensure that we continue to look after these people. Admittedly, they are often in dire circumstances and they are willing to take any chance they can to stay in Australia&mdash;and no-one would object to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and I represent electorates which include people who have come from truly terrible circumstances, and those people come to see us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the Immigration people who work in these foreign countries have a very arduous job. I recall that some years ago, when I visited Thailand, I went to the Vietnamese refugee camps on the border of Thailand and Cambodia. There were thousands of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees in these camps. Immigration department workers from Australia, Canada and the US were processing many of them. I sat through a number of interviews with a young woman from the Australian immigration department who was handling many of these cases. People would come in and she would talk to them. Some of them would get approval, and some would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the way back to Bangkok in the car that afternoon, I said to her that it must be a terrible thing to have to make the choice. She said that it was the hardest job she had ever had in the department. Parents would come in with little kids, and she would look at the parents' application and know that they would not make it, but she would look at the little kids and think, `How can I not try to help you?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those Immigration workers are some of the best representatives the Australian government has around the world. There are people in some parts of the department who do not do a very good job, and I have made remarks about that before. I must say that, after being in that camp with that young woman on that day, I was impressed greatly with the work done by the people from Immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot blame people who try to get into Australia and then, when they get here, try to manipulate the system so they can stay. But that is why we in this parliament have to be vigilant in ensuring that there is fairness in the system so that the same rule applies to every person who gets on that long queue&mdash;whether it is in Asia, the former Yugoslavia or Lebanon, when the war was on there. We should deal with them as fairly as we deal with those people who manage to get here and jump the queue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cannot show that there is some integrity in the system at this end, we are just encouraging people to jump the queue all the time. One way of ensuring that there is integrity in the system is by ensuring that criminals like Boltinos are not there to raise people's expectations and maybe cause them to do things that might bring the system into disrepute. I think the registration of agents has gone a long way towards doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the registration of agents took too damn long to happen, considering that there was provision in the immigration legislation for registering agents who acted outside of Australia. I think anyone outside of Australia who charged more than a dollar for advice to a person to come to Australia had to be an agent. But we did not register people who did that here in Australia. That led to a disreputable underside of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people will take a bit of offence at this, but I think it needs to be said. I have a twinge of doubt about the ability of people who were senior officers of the immigration department to become agents. While those people might do that quite properly and above board, it does tend to imply to people who are trying to stay in this country and who come from regimes where governments are, to say the least, often quite corrupt that as Mr X and Ms X were senior officers of the department before they became agents they will have all sorts of contacts within the department that can help them. I think there is something to be said for the American provisions&mdash;it might be the British provisions&mdash;that state that some time has to elapse between when you leave public service and when you enter a related type of industry, either lobbying the government or acting for people with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a need in this very sensitive area for the right thing not only to be done but also to be seen to be done. Former senior people in the field of immigration acting as agents can give the impression that they have some inside knowledge and that their clients can get some inside running that others cannot. The committee might consider whether there should be some separation time between when people leave the Public Service and set themselves up in these kinds of jobs. I look forward to the report the committee will bring down on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very strongly support the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5). I think it is moderate and also overdue. One of the main benefits of this bill is that it will give the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the discretion to determine whether a person is an eligible non-citizen. This is a result of the recommendations of the report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention</EMPHASIS> by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this provision is a very useful addition. We have previously had the situation of people with very clear moral claim simply being precluded by the legislation. For instance, under the old act it was not possible to do anything about a person who was an unlawful non-citizen upon entering the migration zone, no matter how valid the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not possible to do anything where a non-citizen made an application for a protection visa after he or she had arrived in Australia. Here again, it is very sensible to have the ability to allow that to happen in certain cases. It was also not possible to do anything where a non-citizen had been in immigration detention for a period of more than six months after the application for a protection visa was made. I think that particular provision has to be treated with utmost discretion. I would certainly hope that any minister would do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a catch-all term in one of these provisions&mdash;where the minister thinks that the determination would be in the public interest. I have some difficulty with that because `what is in the public interest' is such a nebulous concept. I recall a previous minister for immigration pointing out that during the early 1970s there was a mass influx of what was clearly a criminal element into Australia from southern Europe. These people were actually detected by the department. Their non-entry was recommended by the department but that was overridden by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister of the day quite clearly and single-handedly established what was to be an element of criminals that put a great burden on Australia. That responsibility resides on any minister where you have this catch-all term about the minister determining what would be in the public interest. That is something which I think the parliament will have to keep under very close scrutiny. I am not opposing that provision being in the bill; I think there are clearly cases where it should be in the bill. I am just saying that the parliament will have to keep a very close eye on that particular provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention a few things about the actions of migration agents. I would like to echo the words of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). I think some of the most incompetent people and charlatans have been found in this area. It is quite true that the average federal politician, no matter what side of parliament he is from, can effectively do and does do everything that a migration agent does, and does not charge. In my own office, which has a very busy migration workload, we find people coming to us repeatedly with expectations blown out of all proportion by migration agents and we find that these people have very often paid migration agents considerable sums of money for incompetent, inept advice. In some cases it has been a straight rip-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that the registration of migration agents is overseeing them strongly enough. I might add that I thought the number of agents in Australia in 1994 was over 1,500. The previous speaker&mdash;I am indebted to him&mdash;said it was 1,692, which is far more than is necessary in my view. I am glad to see that we are making stronger efforts to control the numbers, although I am not sure that we are going to have the facilities to administer and oversee them well enough. I still find that people coming through my office have been getting very bad advice in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker talked about public servants going from the Public Service, the immigration department, straight into the consulting area. This concerns me as well. I feel that it sends the wrong sorts of signals to people. If this applies to members of the Public Service, then it applies even more so to ministers. I feel very uncomfortable when ministers go from a sensitive portfolio into the area of consulting because, with the best will in the world, it brings with it connotations which are very hard to refute. I say that with some sadness, because the minister involved was a man for whom I had a very high regard, although I had many arguments with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a few words on immigration as a policy. It needs to be stated over and over again that the only ground for any migrant coming to Australia is net benefit to Australia. If it is not a net benefit to Australia, then we should think very carefully about it. We may decide after thinking carefully that there are overwhelming compassionate grounds, and I accept that that is likely to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems is the emotive nature of the refugee issue. Australia has a very good record in regard to treatment of refugees. Per capita, it has probably done better than any country in the world. I believe the flow of genuine political refugees to Australia today is minimal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the people approaching us for refugee status today are economic refugees. No matter how compelling their story of personal misery or personal suffering is, Australia cannot solve the world's economic refugee problem. Simple arithmetic should point this out. Were we as a nation to take 100 million people out of China or India, it would not make a  scrap of difference to those countries&mdash;not a scrap&mdash;but it would give Australia a living standard somewhat akin to that of Bangladesh. That is not the future I want for my children. I believe the major responsibility of every government is not to the world but to the citizens of its own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reaffirm very strongly my belief that immigration should be based entirely on net benefit to Australia; if there is no net benefit, then you simply do not do it. This will cause cries of `shock' and `horror' from some quarters who will tell me that the family reunion program is unassailable. I say it is not, and it must be reviewed. In the long term it will be reviewed but, in my view, it should be reviewed at the very earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that the number of refugees in Australia has been allowed to rise is the growth of what I call the guilt industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I echo the words of ex-Senator Walsh. When we do this we usually put it back not on ourselves but on the unspeakable British. Senator Walsh was a man who grew up, according to his own book, in a family with a well-developed Anglophobia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actions must always be judged by the era in which they happened, not by the standards of the day. If you judge the actions in Australia by the standard of the times, they were remarkably enlightened.

If people think that this nation, as we know it, need necessarily be here in a hundred years time, they are wrong. It will survive only if we are committed to its survival. I affirm that the guilt industry undermines and saps the will of Australia's confidence in its national integrity and its sovereign right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me repeat: the only reason for immigration should be net benefit to Australia. That sounds callous, but I believe that in Australia governments' responsibilities are to the people in Australia now.

Bob Hawke said that one of his great triumphs was to conspire with the ACTU and the Liberal Party to get immigration and multiculturalism off the agenda. While his motives may have been good, that decision was wrong and silly. We need constant and ongoing discussion on these vital issues. If the people of Australia were consulted&mdash;and they have not been&mdash;you would find the policy of immigration would be overwhelmingly rejected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to talk about the integrity of the visa system. I notice in the legislation that the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act 1992 will be repealed retrospectively. I note that the government's position on that issue is that other mechanisms can be used to achieve the same ends. Maintenance of the integrity of the visa system is important to my electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland. The public is concerned, certainly in my electorate, about the number of illegal immigrants. The tourism industry is a very important industry in my electorate. There is no doubt that in the tourism industry a lot of people are working on both temporary entry visas and working holiday visas. I have already made comments in this place about the need not only to maintain the integrity of the visa system but also to rigidly enforce those regulations that are currently in place. </PARA>

When walking up the Esplanade in Cairns it is quite obvious that a lot of people who are working in the tourism industry are not Australian nationals. Unfortunately, there is a lot of suspicion in the Cairns population that some of those people are illegals. Certainly the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has at most times been vigilant in enforcing the regulations, but it is very significant that certain measures announced in the budget will target ensuring that those regulations are enforced. </PARA>

Some 53 per cent of employers are now doing the right thing. There is a concern, nevertheless, that there are not only overstayers but other people working illegally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern to me that there are continuing calls for what is called the liberalisation of the visa system. It is of particular concern to me because I represent an area where a high number of non-Australian residents are working on visas in the tourism industry. There is no doubt that the industry could not survive without Japanese tour guides. I am concerned that Australian citizens and Australian residents have an opportunity to participate in that industry. Because of the casual nature of that industry, unfortunately, constituents come to me and say that they have difficulty getting shifts as a result of the presence of people on working holiday and temporary resident visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, and that reason alone, we have to be very careful about calls for further liberalisation of the visa system. I concede there may be a day&mdash;when we have proper career paths in the tourism industry, when we have people trained in Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese who can take up a vast share of the available jobs in the tourism industry&mdash;when we will be able to talk about liberalisation. Until that point comes, we have to look after Australian citizens. We have to look after the next generation. In my electorate that means looking after the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are encouraging young people to learn Japanese. Korean will be important in the near future. We have flights from Korea just starting to come into Cairns. That is very welcome, But the tourists will need tour guides. It is very important that we encourage people to work in the tourism industry and provide jobs for them. The only way to do that is to make sure that the integrity of the visa system is maintained and that the existing rules, which are fair rules, are enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is welcoming to see that the immigration department is doing its job and is continuing to do its job in enforcing the visa system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public is concerned about that. There are suspicions about people working as illegals&mdash;that is, without any visa at all. Unfortunately, the public has a feeling that nothing is being done and that local people are not getting a fair go.

That is what the government has implemented in its policy relating to asylum seekers, and it is in compliance with Australia's international human rights obligations. As I said, Senator Bolkus and the government should be congratulated on their approach. I support the bill before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1995 makes five principal changes to the migration laws in prospect. The bill seeks to amend certain detention procedures to implement recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. It seeks to extend temporarily the migration agents registration scheme pending the outcome of an inquiry into its operation. It seeks to add flexibility to the questions which can be asked on passenger cards of visitors to Australia at their port of entry. It proposes to remove the requirement for the government to provide English language training to certain categories of visa applicants. Finally, it repeals retrospectively the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act 1992. It is only in relation to that last matter that I seek to raise issues today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of people living and working illegally in Australia is a significant one. These people are visitors whom Australia has welcomed and who have overstayed their visas. They are referred to by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs as unlawful non-citizens. Australia issues tourist, student and temporary resident visas to about 2,428,000 people each year. Conditions are attached to these visas, a principal one being the expectation that the people will leave Australia at the end of their authorised stay. A small percentage, less than one per cent, overstay their visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the latest figures available from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, there were an estimated 69,637 unlawful non-citizens in Australia at 30 June 1994. While most of these overstayers, some 47,800, arrived on visitor visas, a significant number of about 11,700 were students who came to Australia to study. These people were not just short-term illegals or people whose visas had only recently expired. Some 83 per cent, or about 58,000, of the unlawful non-citizens in Australia in June 1994 had been here illegally for more than a year. Some 36 per cent of the overstayers had overstayed their visas by more than five years, and 13 per cent had exceeded their visas by a period of nine years or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With concerns about the level of unemployment among Australians who are here lawfully, it is important that the problem of unlawful non-citizens be tackled appropriately. The Australian social security system is already carrying a significant burden. This means that it is important that any jobs which are available in Australia be filled by people who are legally in the country and who are making a contribution to the economy by way of payment of income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immigration legislation provides for the removal from Australia of people who are no longer here legally and who are taking no steps to obtain a visa. In the financial year 1993-94, 16,392 unlawful non-citizens were located. Of these, 1,438 had applied and failed to obtain asylum in Australia. In the same period there were 8,870 enforced departures made up of 825 deportations and 8,045 supervised departures. The largest single national group of unlawful non-citizens located in the relevant financial year was from the People's Republic of China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing concern about the unlawful non-citizens who work while in Australia is illustrated by a study of the illegal overstayers who were located during 1993-94. Some 31 per cent of the total number of unlawful non-citizens admitted that they had been working. They had worked in jobs as diverse as magazine editing and computer programming, as well as the more traditional areas of fruit picking, factory working and taxi driving. Of those located in the previous year, some 37.4 per cent said they had been working, while the figure for the year before that was 51.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the task of identifying, locating and dealing with these unlawful non-citizens does not come without some charge, an expense that is borne by the Australian taxpayer. The cost is not a small one. The program with responsibilities for locating and dealing with unlawful non-citizens had a budget in 1993-94 of $35.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all by way of background to the proposal in the bill before the House today to repeal the visa tax act. The visa tax act was introduced by the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. Gerry Hand, in November 1992. In the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the visa tax bill, the government stated that the visa tax act would impose a tax on an application for the grant of a visa or entry permit to a non-citizen who had been unlawfully in Australia for 12 months or more. The tax was payable by the applicant and had to be paid before the person could be granted a visa or entry permit. The amount of the tax was to be $3,000 for each completed year of unlawful status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visa tax act also provided for the indexation of that amount for the years after 1992-93. An unlawful non-citizen who was subsequently granted refugee status would be exempt from the tax. There was a provision in the visa tax act which empowered the immigration minister to exclude the tax where the minister determined that it would cause extreme hardship to compel payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the then minister explained that the visa tax act was part of a package of migration legislation reforms which would provide more effective measures to detect and remove non-citizens who are unlawfully in Australia. The then minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax is intended to serve as an incentive for persons to come forward at an early stage to regularise their status, rather than remaining unlawfully in Australia indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prime objective is to deter people from remaining in Australia unlawfully rather than to raise revenue.</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the visa tax act did not come into effect until 1 September 1994 when the Migration Reform Act 1992 was implemented. It has thus been enforced for a period of less than nine months. By the provisions of the bill before the House today, the government seeks to repeal the visa tax act and to do so retrospectively. What this means is that the repealing of the visa tax act will be backdated to the date of the commencement of that act. In other words, the government wants to wipe the act from the statute books as if it had never been there at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this compels me to ask the government: why repeal an act that has been enforced for only nine months? In the explanatory memorandum that was tabled with this bill, we are told that the number of people liable for the tax is minimal. But, according to the department's own figures, in June last year about 58,000 people who were unlawful non-citizens had outstayed their visas by more than a year and were therefore in the category caught by the visa tax act. I put aside for the moment the question of the way the government is using tax legislation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He knows about the virtual monopoly position those four banks have in the banking system by virtue of the bank licences extended to them by the Commonwealth. We have said in this budget that there is a need to tighten fiscal policy, but, again, we have to be careful where the load falls. In this case, given the enormous shift in the profitability of banks, it is entirely appropriate that some of the load should fall on the profits of the banks. This does not need to be reflected in any change in mortgage rates. To do so would only maintain those profits at those extraordinarily high levels. To maintain those profits at those extraordinarily high levels would simply mean that the banks are taking the best from the recovery and putting very little back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition should also be aware that a number of banks have reduced their fixed interest mortgage rates in the last two weeks&mdash;the National Australia Bank is one and Westpac is another.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason is that the financing task of the Commonwealth government will fall from $21 billion last year to $6.2 billion this year. There will be a turnaround of around $14.8 billion in the Commonwealth's gross borrowings&mdash;the largest single year reduction in the budget financing task on record. That is why, given that the demand for Commonwealth bonds is going to fall so sharply&mdash;a $14.8 billion reduction, from $21 billion&mdash;if there are fewer bonds around the price of the bonds will rise and therefore the interest yield will drop. That is what has happened in the last week. That is why the long-term bond yield has come down by a percentage point in the last week. That is the big indicator of interest rates in the economy.

There has been a five per cent growth in employment over the last 12 months, the unemployment rate is now down to 8.3 per cent, the long-term unemployed numbers are coming down even further, the labour force is expanding, and the participation rate has gone up by 0.4 of a per cent, which shows that the supply side measures, in particular those associated with getting the long-term unemployed back into the work force, are working extremely well indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have done in this recovery is to open up the employment growth for everyone. We said that we would not leave the long-term unemployed behind, and they are not being left behind. Across the country the news is replicated all around the place. For the first time in more than four years the unemployment rate has fallen below 10 per cent in every state, which means that South Australia and Tasmania are importantly picking up advantage in employment terms from this recovery. From the trend statistics, if one wants to say these are just another aberration, another month, on top of the past 23 months that they have been making the same call, the trend figure shows the continuing decline in the unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the opposition say about this? Every month we have seen a press release put out by the shadow minister. If we go back over the months we find that he said on 27 May last year that he looked forward to holding me `personally accountable for the contribution to the unemployment tragedy'. Well, hold me accountable. In June he said: `Government's job target looks shaky.' In July he said, `Unemployment up', in November, `Full-time employment weakens', and on 9 February this year: `Unemployment up, fewer full-time jobs in January.' On 6 April he picked up the line of the Leader of the Opposition about `the little sunlight for job seekers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you what: in the last two years there have been 640,000 beams of sunlight for the people who have been beneficiaries of this jobs growth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But with all of those press releases over the past 12 months, did we get one today from the shadow minister? No, no press release. The news is too good. He cannot even bring himself to welcome that news.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for them is that it is lasting; the employment growth is lasting. Our commitment to getting to five per cent unemployment and these contributions to it do demonstrate that the government's policies are working and will continue to work.

Supporting that sector in export market development and access is important to it, and that is why we have extended the scheme by $14.4 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When every member of this House has left it and been replaced by somebody else, the thing in Tuesday night's budget that will be there supporting the country will be the changes to superannuation. The government has always believed that the superannuation arrangements were the best opportunity we had to give working Australians a higher standard of living in retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important feature of this is that the demographics of the country are changing&mdash;as you would know, Mr Speaker. When the baby boom generation&mdash;which you and I belong to&mdash;reaches retirement age, there will be half as many again retired people as there are today. About five or eight years after that, there will be nearly twice as many people of retirement age as there are today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will put inordinate weight on fiscal policy and the pension scheme as it exists today. Pensioners who are interested in keeping the 25 per cent of average weekly earnings standard achieved under Labor will find a lot of pressure against that without private provision and complementation to the pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government understood that 10 years ago. With the ACTU, we put together the first superannuation arrangements&mdash;the three per cent scheme&mdash;in 1985-86. We built that to five per cent and then, to get the compliance up, in 1991 the government introduced the superannuation guarantee charge, which will take the level of employer contributions to nine per cent by the year 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In One Nation, we said that we would try to introduce employee contributions along the way to advance the scheme further. In Tuesday night's budget, the Treasurer announced that. He also announced that the government would match the contribution by funding more than the One Nation tax cuts into employees' superannuation accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of that will be that the nine per cent that we provided under the superannuation guarantee charge will rise to 15 per cent&mdash;a mature contribution for the whole nation. It will mean that a couple in their 30s today will find that they will retire on a sum that is three-quarters more than the current pension and their children will retire on a sum that is twice the current pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you the figures this way. A person on average weekly earnings, a person on $33,000 a year today, who was in the scheme to maturity&mdash;that is, for over 40 years&mdash;would retire with an annuity of $30,000 a year.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It buys what $30,000 a year buys today. These figures do not reflect inflation but are in the dollars of today, in 1995 dollars. That annuity comes from a lump sum of $461,000. In other words, someone on $33,000 a year would build for themselves $461,000. The lump sum of someone on twice average weekly earnings&mdash;that is, around $60,000 today&mdash;would be $750,000 and their real average retirement income per year under an annuity would be $42,000 a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only will we see this enormous improvement in retirement incomes but we will also see an enormous improvement in national savings. When the government first introduced superannuation there was only 40 per cent coverage of employees. The Leader of the Opposition is always running around saying, `People have got to save.' He was the Treasurer for five years. How come he left me as Treasurer, the government and the member for Gellibrand as Treasurer a system which covered only 40 per cent of employees? Under Labor that system now covers 90 per cent of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures on the rise for women are even more dramatic than those figures because women were previously disenfranchised from the system. They got their money, they left when they had a child and that was the end of it. Now they can preserve it to age 55 and they can build these sorts of sums for themselves in their own name, in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That change is a revolutionary change to savings. The $40 billion that existed in super funds in 1983 is $186 billion today and the Treasury is forecasting it to be $2,000 billion by the year 2020. That is $2 trillion, $2,000 billion&mdash;about 30 times our current national debt. I think that puts the weight into perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury estimates that additional savings from Labor's superannuation policy will be four per cent of GDP. Everybody in the House, I think, accepts that the current account problem is of the order of two percentage points of GDP. It has been from the middle to late 1980s onwards. There is a four percentage point to GDP change in superannuation alone and a four percentage point to GDP change from the shift in budget policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That change will occur somewhere over the next 20-odd years. If we just take the change from now to the end of the century, we are probably talking about somewhere between three per cent and four per cent in the next five or six years&mdash;a three to four percentage point change in savings to meet a two percentage point problem on the current account. That is why the budget met the medium-term prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would only have happened, this superannuation scheme, from a Labor government. We are the only people who could build a relationship with the work force and get them to agree to put some of their income away as savings and then fund the One Nation tax cuts, and more, into their employee superannuation accounts. It is like every other great thing&mdash;whether it is floating the dollar, whether it is removing exchange controls, whether it is knocking the tariff barrier down, whether it is changing the micro economy or lifting or developing a comprehensive national private savings plan for Australia&mdash;it is always Labor, only ever the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight the Leader of the Opposition has a budget reply. Tonight we can hear from the Leader of the Opposition how he would change Australia, how he would change public policy. He has already told us that he will not touch revenue. The shadow Treasurer has told us that they will not adjust revenue. Therefore, the brunt of the whole of his fiscal changes will be borne by cuts in government spending. He should say what he believes the order of those cuts should be. He should tell us how he intends to deal with the current account deficit. He should tell us how he wants to extend opportunity with education and participation in tertiary education and TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, at 7.30 tonight, is the Leader of the Opposition's big moment to tell us where he stands or to tell us rather that it is really only a cacophony of catcalls and distortions, that it is only a cacophony of exaggeration and claims, that he is not only the same person he was in the 1980s but also policy tired and without policy fizz. I am quite happy to conclude the answer by repeating what I said when I started: when all of us have gone, this change will live on to give Australia what it has never had under 23 years of coalition governments&mdash;a comprehensive private saving scheme to lift retirement incomes and to dramatically boost national savings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all sections of Australia are benefiting from that, including the west and north-western parts of Melbourne which include the honourable member's electorate and my own. Those electorates are also areas which have above average levels of unemployment and it is certainly important that we address that issue and try to do what we can within available resources to ensure they get a proportionately high level of the funds which are available to address the unemployment issue through labour market programs in those areas. That is what happens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do direct our funds in terms of categories of people, such as long-term unemployed or youth or non-English speaking persons. We direct our funds particularly to assist groups who are most likely to find it difficult to get back into employment. We also do it on an area basis, so that there are substantial funds, above average funds, for the number of people in an area put into the areas of highest unemployment. In this financial year 1994-95, some $118 million of labour market programs are being spent in the north-western region of Melbourne. That is proportionately a high level of expenditure, and so it ought to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will be higher next year because there are more funds coming into labour market programs, despite the so-called cutbacks in the budget. They were cutbacks off the forward estimates which were well up on the expenditure in 1994-95. So we are looking at increased expenditure on labour market programs, on job subsidies to get people directly into jobs and on training allowances to assist people to qualify for employment. Those expenditures will be considerably higher in 1995-96 than they were in 1994-95 under the Working Nation program that has been adopted by the government last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very concerned to continue to bring about a decline in the unemployment levels, particularly of long-term unemployed people. It has been a matter of some satisfaction in the last 12 months that those numbers have come down by some 80,000-odd, or about 25 per cent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to do so. As the Prime Minister mentioned earlier in question time, it is the case that the Commonwealth's borrowing program will be considerably reduced this financial year, 1995-96, by the fact of the budget turnaround as announced by me on Tuesday night. What we have seen is a $12.9 billion turnaround, from a deficit of $12.2 billion to a surplus of $700 million. That turnaround means that there is, accordingly, much less need for the government to go to the markets to borrow. It means that the government's financing task in association with repayment of maturing debt&mdash;instead of seeking some $21 billion, which was the borrowing task this year&mdash;in 1995-96 will be just over $6 billion. So it is a major reduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overwhelming part of that reduction of some $15 billion comes from the turnaround in the budget as presented to this parliament; that is, going from a deficit of $12.2 billion to a surplus of $700 million&mdash;almost a $13 billion turnaround. That demonstrates the importance of delivering the budget in the way in which it is delivered and has traditionally been delivered. The way in which the budget is set out has a direct significance for the financing task of the Commonwealth, and that reduction in the financing task is itself very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister alluded to, what it means is that, with a lesser amount of borrowing, we have the likelihood of a higher price for government paper, which means the yields on them will be less and therefore there is reduced pressure on interest rates, because the bond rates will be less than they would otherwise have been with a higher financing task. That is a very important factor. That is the way in which the reduction in the budget deficit and turning it into a surplus turns into reduced pressure on interest rates. That is the way it happens, in association with the fact that the fiscal tightening in the budget reduces the inflationary pressures in the economy. This also bolsters the confidence of investors about inflation in the future. It means that they are less likely to be looking for higher interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The change in the government's borrowing task is of great significance. The presentation of the budget&mdash;in the way it was presented to this parliament; as it has always been&mdash;has that direct significance in terms of demonstrating the change in the financing task and the impact on the markets in terms of pressure on interest rates. It is important for the House to understand that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also means that we are looking forward to reductions in Commonwealth debt. We are seeing that the Commonwealth net debt, which in 1994-95 is about 19.1 per cent of GDP, will reduce over the forward estimates period to 13.7 per cent of GDP. There will be about a 5 1/2 per cent decline over that period. We are looking forward to reduced pressure on interest rates and substantial declines in government debt. Those, of course, are important and satisfactory outcomes for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also of interest to note that the importance of that is recognised by influential people.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How much of a concern is that current account deficit? </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His answer&mdash;which I think is quite interesting&mdash;was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our expectation is, and is proving true, that the Government would not allow such a large current account deficit to be maintained in the medium-term and therefore the Government is making sure that fiscal policy tries to deal with it . . . the best way to try to deal with a current account deficit is to try and reduce the Government deficit. As a result, I don't know what else you could ask the Government to do to try to deal with a current account deficit, the size of which no one had, as far as I know, really predicted a year or so ago.</PARA>
<PARA>That I would say is a clear endorsement by Moody's of the budget, of the government's fiscal policy, of the fact that the borrowing task is being greatly reduced and of the fact that this has considerable relevance to addressing the current account deficit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On budget night I released the government's agenda for families, with my colleagues the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Family Services. The agenda for families contains practical policies of support for families. Let me come to a number of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important is the maternity allowance. The majority of Australian women at this time do not receive paid maternity leave. As a consequence of the budget changes, in the future they will be entitled to independent income support for six weeks following the birth of a child. That is currently the equivalent of $816. So the government will be paying women who have had a child independent income support for six weeks, coming to the equivalent of $816. This is quite a sea change in terms of supporting families and supporting families when they need that support most&mdash;when a child has come into the family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget the government has also given special attention to families most in need. We have increased rent assistance to low income families and the guardians allowance for sole parents. The agenda includes a range of other policies, such as an increase in the number of child-care places, increased funding for child immunisation and measures to tackle the urgent problem of youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also taken the opportunity in the budget to simplify our family payments and to make it easier for families to get assistance and improve support for family members caring for sick and elderly relatives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such support includes a universal access to health care through Medicare, more than a fivefold increase in the number of child-care places from 46,000 to 253,000, a significant real increase in family payments of over 75 per cent for low income families, a new parenting allowance for parents who stay at home to care for their children&mdash;which means that nearly 120,000 families will gain $59 a week&mdash;and the introduction of the child-care cash rebate to help parents meet the cost of child care.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question because she, together with the member for Moreton and indeed all Queensland members, has been actively lobbying the government to ensure that Queensland gets its fair share of university places. I might say that the budget was very good news for the higher education sector. What this budget has done is build on the commitment of this government over the past 12 years to significantly expand the higher education sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time prior to this budget, the commitments that this government has made have seen university places increased by 70 per cent. This is a massive commitment to ensuring quality in the higher education sector and giving our young people real opportunities to get into universities. This budget continues to build on that investment. In the next three years the budget has committed to provide 5,850 new university places&mdash;the great bulk of those are going to Queensland. In fact, 4,200 of them go to Queensland on top of the 500 that we gave at the end of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked a question on a previous occasion in this House as to whether we could guarantee the continuation of the 500 places. Not only are we guaranteeing that; we have multiplied it in a huge way to ensure that Queensland gets its fair share. Queensland is not the only beneficiary because other members in the House who live in growth areas in New South Wales and Western Australia also have the same problem. The budget makes an allocation of places to those states to pick up on the growth in those places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these places have been delivered without taking any away from the other states. There was indignation about this on the other side of the House. The South Australians and Victorians came in and said, `If you are doing it for Queensland, don't take them off us.' The reality is that we have delivered the places without taking any existing places away. I suggest to the House that this is a very significant commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only university places that we are funding. We recognise that if we are going to put more people into universities they need the facilities to be taught in and to be housed in. So there is also money for infrastructure to support these places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go further. We have recognised the need to build the research base further within the universities. Research infrastructure funding in this budget goes up 57 per cent over the next three years. We have increased the number of research places. We have done this without any cuts to the higher education sector, with no up-front fees for undergraduate students and with no increase in the HECS debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another example of: while we are doing it, what is the opposition saying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with this as briefly as I can. However, I should draw the House's attention to the announcement on 8 December last year of a comprehensive package of measures to address the severe impact of aircraft noise on the communities surrounding Kingsford Smith airport. As the House will recall, that package included restricted flight paths; heavy penalties for breaches of these flight paths; a comprehensive noise insulation program, which will now cost $260 million; and a requirement to minimise northerly take-offs and the impact of those take-offs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can now report that all of these noise abatement measures are in place or are in the process of being implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government on that occasion also foreshadowed the establishment of a broadly based community consultative committee&mdash;a committee which would provide the opportunity for the noise affected residents to monitor the airport's operations as well as progress with the noise abatement measures. In line with that commitment, I can inform the House and the honourable member today that the former Sydney airport environment committee will be totally reconstituted to provide wide community representation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of community input, the new consultative committee will include an independent chairman; seven community representatives, nominated by federal MPs in electorates affected by the airport operations; nine community representatives nominated by state MPs from similarly affected electorates; 14 local government council representatives; the Civil Aviation Authority; the Federal Airports Corporation; the Commonwealth Department of Transport; the New South Wales Department of Planning; the New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency; and three aviation industry representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that the new committee will look at airport matters including reports on the noise and health impacts of the airport's operations, the radar tracks of each day's flights to and from the airport, possible breaches of the flight path corridors, the adequacy of the flight path and noise monitoring arrangements, the enforcement of the airport curfew and progress with the insulation and acquisition program.

The process will be supported by a secretariat within the Commonwealth Department of Transport. The new committee will be required to publish an annual report on its operations for tabling here in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having established the framework, it is now our intention to have the new committee up and running as soon as possible. In this regard, I am pleased to advise the House today that the Hon. Joe Riordan, the newly appointed Chairman of Worksafe Australia, has generously accepted the government's invitation to serve as Chairman of the Sydney Airport Consultative Committee. I might say that, as chairman, Mr Riordan will bring to this position his long history of distinguished service in Australian public life, as both a federal government minister and a very distinguished senior deputy president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the new consultative committee will afford those communities bearing the burden of aircraft noise the opportunity to closely monitor the airport's operations and a regular opportunity to question those responsible for the operations.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="367" SPEAKER="Brereton The Hon L.J." NAMEID="5T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSFORD-SMITH" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the campaign by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and, indeed, its new president, the former chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, Dick Smith. Members on both sides of the House have been inundated in the last couple of days with calls from pilots around the countryside fearful of a 60 per cent increase in aviation duty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I say that, like everyone in the House, I have a great deal of respect for Dick Smith. He is, after all, one of Australia's leading philanthropists. In his time he has made a great deal of money and he has given away a very large amount of it to Australia's charitable causes. He is at his best when he is being philanthropic. He is at his worst when he is creating fear amongst the members of his association. I have received a forest worth of paper in the last week. I have here individual letters from pilots around the countryside, all as part of this campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate that I should put the facts before the House. There is no 60 per cent increase in duty on avgas. The present charge for avgas is 17.23c per litre. With the 0.9c per litre increase contained in this week's budget, it will go to 18.1c per litre. That is a fully hypothecated charge. Every penny of that goes to the aviation industry. Of that, 15.7c per litre goes to air services and 1.5c per litre goes to air safety regulation. The 0.9c per litre increase is for aviation regulation and it represents in total a five per cent increase, not a 60 per cent increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out to the House that this charge is very low in historic terms. When Dick Smith became chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority in February 1990, the charge was not 18.1c per litre; it was 25.648c per litre. Two years later when he left that post it was at its highest level ever&mdash;27.48c per litre. It is now, with this 0.9c increase, down to 18.1c per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out in answer to the honourable member that the general aviation area pays only a tiny proportion of total air services charges. Indeed, last year 97 per cent of all of the money raised in these charges, $467.1 million, was raised from international and domestic RPT operators. Only $15.4 million, that is three per cent, of the total expenditure, or $482 million, was raised from the general aviation area through the avgas levy. That is a very reasonable impost given that the last report of the directorate of air safety regulation said that 27 per cent of all its time and attention, of all its resources, was used up investigating private and sporting planes in the general aviation area. So the general aviation area funds only a tiny proportion of the total attention that it receives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not be answering each one of these letters individually because that would be a great waste of time and money, but I do think this House should be aware that it is a five per cent increase, not a 60 per cent increase. It is entirely reasonable to fund the strict safety controls we are implementing as a result of the parliamentary inquiry chaired by the member for Shortland and as a result of the royal commission being undertaken by Justice Staunton.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;All of us hoped that the end of the Cold War would lead to a new world order of peace and prosperity. Unfortunately that has not come to pass. In particular, the number, the severity and the complexity of humanitarian crises have dramatically increased in recent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government, and Australians generally, through Australian non-government organisations, have responded generously and compassionately to these crises. Among others, CARE Australia has played a prominent humanitarian role in some of the world's most desperate trouble spots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously essential, and it is the expectation of those who entrust funds to those humanitarian agencies, that the funds allocated to alleviate human suffering in these dire circumstances are used effectively and efficiently. There have, however, been some allegations made about CARE's account-ability for its use of such funds. I therefore initiated an audit of CARE Australia's financial systems in November 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This audit follows up the findings and recommendations of an earlier audit conducted by the NSW Audit Office, which itself recommended that such a follow-up audit be conducted. I expanded the terms of reference of this follow-up audit when Mr Bernard Broughton, a former employee of CARE Australia, reiterated the serious allegations he had made about CARE Australia previously and offered to make documentary evidence available to the auditors, as he had not done when the previous audit had been carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against this background that today I propose to table the audit report of CARE Australia prepared by the independent accounting firm BDO Nelson Parkhill. A number of findings contained in the report give rise to concern. Most of the more serious findings of the audit relate to projects undertaken prior to 1991, when CARE was still in its infancy and struggling to develop administrative systems to back up its rapidly expanding work in the field. The report finds that CARE now has an effective control structure in place but still needs to improve certain management practices. CARE has recently commissioned a management efficiency review which I hope will further improve its management. The most serious audit findings concern:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">the acquittal of funding for a 1988-89 Mozambique food aid project, which was overstated by $208,703&mdash;I am pleased to advise that CARE has now returned the outstanding funds to the Commonwealth; and the budget presented to Ausaid for the `Health CARE for the Khartoum displaced in Sudan project', which was at variance with the information provided to CARE's counterpart agency in Sudan. The auditors recommend that at least $30,000 should be refunded. </PARA>
<PARA>The auditors also found:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">that budgets presented by CARE Australia to Ausaid, on occasions, have been overstated;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">that moneys raised from the Australian public have, on occasions, not been applied to projects in accordance with the stated objectives of the fundraising campaigns concerned; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">that certain management, contracting and monitoring arrangements&mdash;which I will not list now since they are spelled out in the report&mdash;need improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government takes the matters raised in the audit very seriously. Such practices are totally unacceptable to the government and I am determined to ensure that systems and practices are put in place to ensure that they do not happen again. In particular, the audit report recommends legal advice be sought in relation to the two most serious findings  referred to above, namely, the acquittal of the 1988-89 Mozambique project and the overstated budget for the 1989-90 Sudan project. In accordance with the auditors' advice, I have sought urgent legal advice on those two matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I received from CARE a response to all of the other recommendations of the audit report. I acknowledge this, and CARE's assurance that it has addressed all the material matters affecting its relationship with the government. In accordance with normal practice, there will be a follow-up audit of CARE Australia in six months time to ensure that appropriate action has been taken on the audit's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of recommendations in the audit relate to accountability issues associated with publicly raised funds. As members may be aware, this issue is of particular concern to me. I have written twice to Mr Bill Scales, Chairman of the Industry Commission inquiry into charitable organisations in Australia, urging the inquiry to make concrete recommendations on public accountability issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members may also be aware that, in support of the work of the inquiry, I have set up a working group to make recommendations on a voluntary code of practice for the guidance of all non-government organisations which provide overseas development assistance. The development of this code of practice is being fully supported by the non-government organisations. Such a code will ensure that the public can with confidence determine objectively what happens to the funds they donate to non-government organisations. In this way, the code of practice will clearly address concerns expressed in this audit report regarding public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to point out that it has not been possible for the auditors to examine all the allegations made about CARE Australia on 26 February on the Channel 9 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. For one thing, access to the Nine Network's files on CARE was denied as a result of legal constraints arising from CARE's defamation proceedings in the ACT Supreme Court. For another, many of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program allegations were subjective or related to the effectiveness of work performed in the field, or to the use of funds from other agencies, such as UNHCR. As such, they fell outside not only the audit terms of reference, but also the power of the Commonwealth to investigate effectively. Naturally, should any further allegations be made concerning the misuse of Commonwealth funds, they also will be fully investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an ill wind which blows nobody any good. I hope that this audit has set the foundations for a renewed confidence in the management of CARE and a constructive relationship between it and Ausaid. It is my earnest hope that this report, and the follow-up actions I have instigated, will finally settle this matter. Importantly for that outcome, it is now up to CARE Australia to satisfy its supporters and the Australian public that its operations are in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by emphasising my conviction that the Australian public should feel very proud of the work undertaken by Australian non-government organisations overseas. These organisations, and the Australians who voluntarily serve them, work in some of the most dangerous and difficult areas of the world. They do fine work saving thousands of lives and assisting poor people towards a more decent existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a tragedy if publicity surrounding this report undermined public confidence in our overseas aid organisations; it should not. There is absolutely no reason for the public to doubt the dedication of their people or the excellence of their work&mdash;which, as Tuesday's budget showed, continues to be supported by Australia's aid agency, Ausaid, to the tune of well over $100 million.

In that context, some of the publicity that this whole exercise has received has been a little unfortunate, because it has the potential to undermine public confidence not only in CARE as an organisation but also in other non-government aid organisations. That is something that we on this side of the House would not want&mdash;and surely the government would not want&mdash;to see happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister said, it is also very true that there is a large number of extremely dedicated people who work for CARE Australia. Many of those people work in extremely harsh conditions with what could only be described as great courage. Some of the work that CARE Australia does for Australian non-government organisations is unique, and that has to be well understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the report of the auditor in general finds CARE Australia to have an effective control structure in place, but I note that it does still need to improve certain management practices. The specific examples of the Mozambique and Sudan projects are a matter of real concern. I note that action has already been taken to remedy one of those concerns and it is being taken to remedy the second concern in Sudan. I also note that the minister has sought legal advice on those particular cases. We can only wait and see what that advice is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been, however, considerable administrative reform within CARE Australia over the last few years. It has to be remembered that most of the complaints raised in relation to CARE occurred before 1991&mdash;some time ago. These were administrative problems in an organisation which was growing very fast and was in its infancy. Clearly, much of the administrative shortcomings that existed then have been rectified. There have been no instances of double dipping found by the auditors, such as CARE being paid twice by different bodies for the same project. It is important to note that there has been a positive response by CARE to the report, acknowledging the need to revise certain administrative practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of actual aid delivery, CARE still performs a very good job in the field with committed workers and efficient use of aid donations made by the Australian public. I note on page 74 of the auditor's report something which is of particular importance: the auditors have examined CARE's figures since its inception in November 1987, which indicate that an average of 88 per cent of total income, less fundraising costs, is expended on the delivery of aid related services. Of the selected sample taken by BDO, the average for all similar Australian organisations was 89 per cent. If you take CARE as at 30 June 1994, then the figure was a very high 96 per cent. I understand that the auditor's figure is higher than CARE's own estimate of, if you like, the efficiency of its organisation. In that sense, it is an organisation which is now performing very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly support what the minister has said on the voluntary code of practice. I look forward to the negotiations on that code of practice coming to a successful conclusion. As I said at the beginning, a lot of the publicity CARE has received is, I suspect, more associated with some of the personalities involved in the organisation than necessarily a reflection on the organisation's overall levels of efficiency. Yes, there have been problems. These are not, in my view, enormously serious problems, but they are problems that need to be rectified and they are being rectified. The sooner we can rebuild national confidence in CARE Australia and, therefore, in other non-government aid organisations, the better. </PARA>

It states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>That was this country's Prime Minister just two days after the budget. That is why the people of Australia will say that they have had absolutely enough of this Prime Minister and this budget when they get an opportunity. They will dispatch him to a new job&mdash;if he is able to find one, be it in Paris, Berlin or elsewhere&mdash;upon the result of the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy enough to concede that the making of a budget is a complex and lengthy process and it does involve some constraints. It involves constraints on who can know what at various stages of the budget process. The most notable example of that this time was in respect of the decision on the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. The Prime Minister does not seem to know much of the detail of that. Yesterday we exposed that that was the case for the Treasurer (Mr Willis), but we exposed it today with respect to the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another good reason why the government did not feel disposed to bring into the consultations a great deal of the cabinet&mdash;the inner ministry&mdash;the outer ministry or the caucus. If in fact it had, it would have had a meltdown from that same cabinet, outer ministry and caucus, because as we get into the detail of the budget we see what this budget really does. It is with a great deal of regret that I record that this budget extinguishes for all time Labor's light on the hill with regard to social justice, fairness and equity. It introduces a series of regressive tax increases that will increase the gap between rich and poor, as borne out by ABS studies and its findings and more comprehensive studies. </PARA>

The member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) has contributed to that, as has his good friend Pro Hart. Go out and ask the Smith Family whether it thinks the gap between rich and poor has got less under Labor. In fact, you do not have to&mdash;just turn straight to the ABS studies, which show that that gap has got bigger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would think that the government might feel a little sheepish about this or at least would want to know what the distributional effects of its budget would be. But no. It is not even game enough to use its own computer in Treasury, its own Prismod model and computer package, to ascertain what the total holistic distributional effects of this budget are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the Treasurer to say that only certain categories of retired people are affected. The government has, in fact, stolen one of our longstanding policies with regard to the abolition of unrealised capital gains tax. The effect is the same: there is a reduction of pension for a pensioner who holds shares and they go up in value. That has gone into the budget. That is one of the coalition's policies that the government has stolen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the government to point out that there are certain niche categories that will have some benefit, but what it runs a million miles from is declaring to the House that the sales tax increases in this budget are regressive, are going to affect families, are going to affect poor families, are going to affect those families lucky enough to be in a position to attempt to remodel their kitchens or whatever and, more particularly, are going to affect young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first purchases young people will make in stepping out in life, having completed their primary and secondary educations, is a motor car. It may be second hand; it may be a motor bike; or, ultimately, it may be a very small first-hand motor car. Many of them have no choice but to attempt to do that as they seek to get to their place of employment beyond the public transport system; as they seek to get to additional tertiary education and tech college courses and the like. They will now find their situation belted by the huge sales tax raft on new cars, which, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Bevis), who is at the table, will concede, will have a knock-on effect into the second-hand car market. </PARA>

Those words will echo the length and breadth of this land, starting with the debates today in the House and the Senate, but elsewhere more so, including a budget breakfast in Brisbane tomorrow.

<PARA>Given this quote, it should be noted that the growth forecast contained in the budget for 1995-96 was 3 3/4 per cent, drifting down to 3 1/2 per cent later on. The current account deficit, meanwhile, is expected to increase from 3.9 per cent to six per cent of GDP. In short, we will have a current account deficit, according to the budget, of a further $27 billion. With this economic growth rate, Australia Incorporated vis-a-vis the world will be sucking in imports in a way which the Prime Minister said we should be able to manage&mdash;in a way we have not been able to manage&mdash;and as a consequence Australia Incorporated on its current account deficit will be $27 billion in the red. </PARA>

That is, this budget and the last Dawkins budget have continued to drive an increasing gap between those in rural and regional Australia and those in capital city Australia who do not have access to public transport. That will be further exacerbated by this sales tax increase where people have no choice but to buy motor vehicles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the opposition, including the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), are obviously fairly excited by the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier today on Brisbane radio. They are a fairly easily excitable lot. Since the delivery of the budget on Tuesday night, those opposite have been rather fascinated&mdash;I must say it is predictable&mdash;by the bottom line that the government was able to produce in its 1995-96 budget. So they should be rather fascinated with the bottom line that produced a surplus. A surplus is something which is unexplored territory for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Liberal-National coalition opposite. They have never encountered it before. In all those years that they occupied the treasury bench in this country, they failed to reach a surplus on any single occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recalling in the context of this debate about the economy and the budget that in the 40-odd years since the current method of calculating budget outlays, expenditure and revenue was put in place&mdash;it was put in place in 1953&mdash;the opposition, when in government, failed to get a surplus. It did not achieve a surplus on a single, solitary occasion. From the day that Robert Menzies got the idea that he should form the Liberal Party and spent all those years in lazy government, they have not once had a surplus. In fact, in the 40-odd years that the current accounting system has applied, only four surplus budgets prior to this budget have been recorded by the Commonwealth, and they were all budgets of Labor governments led by Bob Hawke and the current Prime Minister. They were the budgets of 1987-88, 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time the Liberals had a chance to try to balance the books, which was the last time they were in office, the now Leader of the Opposition, who was then Treasurer, produced a budget with a whopping $4 1/2 billion deficit. This deficit equated to 2.6 per cent of the country's GDP. If we took that 2.6 per cent today and applied it in today's dollars, it would mean a budget deficit of $12 billion. That is the scale of the deficit that the Liberal Party produced for Australia when it last held the reins of government. That was the performance of the current opposition leader when he was the Treasurer. Against that background, those opposite stand in some wonderment at a government that has been able to produce not just the first surplus budget but the fifth surplus budget in current accounting history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to Tuesday night I think there was an expectation abroad in the community and in the markets that would have looked favourably upon a deficit budget of maybe $2 billion to $4 billion. Certainly, they would have been tickled pink with anything in the $2 billion range. The government produced a surplus in excess of $700 million. It is worth recalling not the petty political comments of those opposite but the comments made earlier today by the senior analyst from Moody's. The Treasurer made some reference to this earlier today in question time. The senior analyst from Moody's in New York, Vincent Truglia, made these comments this morning on the budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From our point of view, going to surplus is a good idea no matter how it is achieved. So I think this is an appropriate policy to take under present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's approach in this budget is, to quote his own words, `an appropriate policy to take under present circumstances'. One of the focuses of the budget was to exert some influence on the current account. In a contribution that rambled mainly across earlier comments of the Prime Minister on talkback radio and touched a little on the budget, the Leader of the National Party made reference to the current account. Let us look at what the senior analyst from Moody's had to say about Australia's current account and the efforts of this government to address it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the best way to try to deal with a current account deficit is to try and reduce the Government deficit. As a result, I don't know what else you could ask the Government to do to try to deal with a current account deficit, the size of which no one, as far as I know, had really predicted a year or so ago.</PARA>
<PARA>Again that is an endorsement of the government's strategy in this budget to turn around the current account deficit. It is worth making mention of the figures in relation to the current account deficit. It is true that the budget estimates indicate a current account deficit at current dollar levels. That is current dollar levels in a bigger economy. The nation's wealth in 12 months time will be greater and, as a result, the current account deficit will fall as a percentage of GDP. That is the important measure. The important measure is not the absolute dollar figure. The measures taken by the government in this budget have turned that around. That fact is acknowledged by the senior analyst of Moody's in New York even if it is not understood by those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, those opposite are devoid of not just economic policies but policies across the board. It is because they are devoid of policies in the economic area that they seek to cast some doubts on the methodology. They try to throw a smokescreen around the budget and divert attention from the good underlying economic substance that is contained in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you cannot talk about the content try to attack the process. That seems to be the idiom. It is a fairly well worn political ploy and one that is fairly readily recognised around here and one that is not about to fool the public in their consideration of the budget. The Treasurer's comments in relation to the budget on Tuesday night were absolutely plain and unequivocal as to how the surplus had been produced. On the first page of the budget speech the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the surplus&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is achieved by cuts to spending, increases in revenue, and asset sales&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he was up-front about the asset sales&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">including part of the proceeds from the sale of the Government's remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the Budget for 1996-97 will be in surplus excluding asset sales and special debt and capital repayments.</PARA>
<PARA>That important point seems to have been lost by the opposition and, I am sad to say, lost by a number of people in the gallery. In 1996-97, the budget will be in surplus without any regard to asset sales and without any regard to special debt repayments. That is an outstanding turnaround. It is a turnaround in the bottom line of the budget which has never before been seen in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There a few things that I should mention about asset sales. Although the Leader of the National Party did not mention this in his speech, it is actually embedded in the matter we are debating. I suspect that this will be part of the contributions of others in this debate. It is worth recognising that the opposition has run the line that somehow this surplus is illusory and that we should not include in the budget surplus a calculation for the revenue generated by asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a fairly quaint approach to how the budget should be put together. It is a different approach to the one that has been adopted in the past. The budget this year has been produced using the same conventions and the same methods as have been used for many years by this government and the former government. When the present Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer that was the method he used. I suspect tonight we are going to hear from the Leader of the Opposition that the bottom line figure is illusory. It is arrived at by a method which he used when he was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the alternatives if you do not do that? Those opposite say that when we purchase a major item we should include it as an expense, but when we sell it we should not include it as revenue. Is that the logic of what those opposite are saying or are they saying that we should cut that out of the budget too? Are they saying that if we have a big spending item in this budget we really should not include it as an expense? They do not think we should include the sale of an asset as revenue or income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the approach they want to adopt they might get a few surprises. I had a quick look through my own portfolio area of defence at just a handful of the major acquisitions this year. In this calendar year defence will be purchasing, in major acquisitions alone, in the order of $1.6 billion. If you want us to take that out and pretend we are not spending that this year, that will be a novel approach to budget accounting. Of course the expenditure should be included. Of course the benefit of the asset sale should be there. In effect, the asset sale represents the income stream that asset would have returned had we kept it. That is what the asset sale is. It is a totally legitimate inclusion. It is an inclusion which you adhered to when you were in charge of the treasury bench and it is in total conformity with the approach adopted by international standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of this has to do with people's expectations about the future and how good people's crystal balls are. I want to go back just 12 months, to the last budget and the comments that were made by people opposite then about our estimates. Bear these in mind when we listen tonight to `Dr Doom' and the doomsayers about the terrible time ahead of us. Last June, in response to the budget, in an MPI not dissimilar to this, the shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remember this. The crucial forecast in the government's budget was for a surge in private business investment. That is the crucial figure.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said of last year's budget. He then went on to give us an idea of what his crystal ball told him about that, in his words, `crucial figure' in the budget. He said this from his crystal ball&mdash;this is your shadow treasurer, your spokesperson's crystal ball:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All we can see is that the recent figures show no sign of a surge in private business investment at all, no sign of that massive lift, no sign in capital expenditure figures, no sign in the national accounts, no sign that business investment is coming up.</PARA>
<PARA>Your prediction, from the person on your side responsible for treasury matters, was that there were no signs at all. We predicted that there would be a 14.5 per cent increase in business investment. That is what we said in the last budget. Do you know what it was, Mr Deputy Speaker? We got a 24 per cent increase. Put that against the best guess estimate of members of the opposition. They said that there were no signs that there would be any increase, that we would not get 14, we would not get 10, we would not get five, that there were no signs to believe that investment would rise at all. Not only did we reach the 14 1/2 per cent mark that we set in the budget; we exceeded it dramatically and will return an increase in investment of 24 per cent in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not just that forecast that you got wrong, and it was not just that forecast that we exceeded. There were other critical forecasts in last year's budget. The GDP forecast was 4 1/2 per cent, we said. You said, as Leader of the National Party, that we would not reach 4 1/2 per cent. You now know, although you do not want to admit it and you will not say it publicly, that we are saying 5 1/2 per cent growth. You said we would not get 4 1/2. Your assessments are not worth the paper they are written on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment forecast in the budget was 9 1/2 per cent. We said it would fall to 9 1/2 per cent. You said it would not. You said we could not reduce unemployment to 9 1/2 per cent. We have reduced it well below that. The figures out today, from memory, show it at about 8.4, 8.5 per cent. That is an outstanding achievement, one which you have not to this moment applauded. At every turn your shadow spokesperson hops up and tries to paint some cloud over the ever improving employment figures. It is about time you woke up to yourself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the tax burden. The Leader of the National Party wanted to make some play on that. At the last election you went to the people, two years ago, with a Fightback package, which you all signed up in blood, with a pledge to increase the company tax rate&mdash;that is right, increase it, make it go up&mdash;from 39 to 42 per cent. But that is not too surprising, given your performance when you were in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last budget you brought down, the Howard budget of 1982-83, had a company tax rate not even of your promised 42 per cent&mdash;the last company tax rate you had was 46 per cent. That is against this budget, which has a 36 per cent tax rate for companies. You are complaining about this budget producing a 36 per cent rate, when you had a 46 per cent rate when you were in office. The same situation applies through private taxes. Regrettably, time will prevent me going through those. But it is worth recalling that the top marginal tax rate under a Liberal government was 60 per cent; it is now 47 per cent. The bottom marginal tax rate under you when you were in government was 30 per cent; it has now dropped to 20 per cent. When we want to talk about who is taxing high, there is no mistake on what is shown by the figures. The figures show that it is you, my friend. When you were in government, you were the people who ensured a high tax regime in both company taxes and personal taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion today and the rhetoric today is a good piece of politicking because you know you have a major headache. You have said you will not increase taxes. You have said we should not count asset sales.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further adjustment can be made to . . . measure of the budget deficit to eliminate the effects of net advances to the States and assets sales. This adjusted measure can provide a more accurate picture of the underlying position of the budget. The National Fiscal Outlook adopts this approach in looking at the deficits of the Commonwealth and States and Territories budgets.</PARA>
<PARA>Table 2 below outlines that budget deficit. What do we find when we look at table 2? In fact, the government has got,  true to form, the asset sales of $5.3 billion-odd and a true budget deficit of $8.2 billion contained in its own document. Of course, it is even higher than that. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you throw in some other minor fiddles and asset sales, the real figure gets up to $8.7 billion. So much for honesty and integrity in regard to the budget outcome! But that budget document is set down on the basis that the government will deliver. It has $5.3 billion worth of asset sales to make the bottom line look good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the government's record in delivering asset sales just in the 1990s.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what other measures you have put into your budget and the promises that you and your Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have made. I remember that on 19 November 1992 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I am promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I will look at not only the aggregate rates of tax but also the budget measures contained within the 1993-94 budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94&mdash;this is after the Prime Minister promised not to put up taxes&mdash;taxes went up by $1.5 billion, running out in out years to $3.7 billion. We need only look at this year's budget&mdash;and remembering the Prime Minister's promise that he would not put up taxes&mdash;to see that the tax measures went up $2.397 billion. Company tax this year went up $320 million. Tax on the automotive industry&mdash;on people trying to buy cars&mdash;went up a whopping $330 million. On people trying to build or renovate their homes, taxes went up $215 million. </PARA>

How much will the Medicare levy raise for the government? How much will it rip into the pockets of the Australian people? Another $230 million. So much for no increases!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it goes on. The tobacco excise went up $70 million. Revenue protection measures&mdash;more tightening and squeezing of small businesses and subcontractors&mdash;went up $396 million.

Yet taxes have gone up $2,397 million. So much for not trying to put up taxes! What happened to the government's tax cuts? The Prime Minister promised this just the other day, and we can also go back and see what he said in the One Nation statement on 26 February 1992. In the One Nation statement, he talked about tax cuts&mdash;surprise, surprise! The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These substantial tax cuts will result in a reform of the tax scales of maximum benefit to the great majority of working men and women of Australia. They will underpin the Accord to ensure that workers do not find their real disposable income increasingly eroded by effective taxes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is pretty darn sure. What is particularly transparent is that the opposition has no policies. I expect to be suitably underwhelmed this evening when the recycled Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) gets up and gives a response. Already he has been locked into `no new taxes' by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello). I think he has been referred to in certain quarters as the permanent low altitude flier. He is pretty good at getting up and making smart remarks during MPIs, but we have never heard from him one piece of credible economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Willis) brought that to the House's attention during the debate on yesterday's matter of public importance. What did the opposition achieve out of the MPI yesterday? The Leader of the Opposition, a former Treasurer of this country, and a supposed future Treasurer of this country, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, went hell for leather on this sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Today the Treasurer was able to read something out of the prospectus which indicates that he made it very clear at the time what government policy was and what government policy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said on budget night that this 1995 budget had snookered the opposition and they were snookered again today, hoisted with their own petard by the fact that they made such a big play out of this prospectus from the Commonwealth Bank. It had forgotten to read the fine print, but all the fine print is in the budget papers. Nothing has been hidden from anybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time and during the debate on the MPI on the day of the budget, there was a great deal of talk about Mr Tony Cole, the former secretary to the Treasury. I gather that he was on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> the night before. Tony Cole's words were quoted and requoted. What does Mr Tony Cole say about this budget?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Budget like this in an election year should encourage our international creditors to believe Australia has at least recognised it can no longer ignore its chronic savings problem. And that is important.</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the day what will affect the livelihoods of families will be whether we can manage this economy and produce a sustainable recovery with jobs. I might remind the two speakers for the opposition that we have a very good track record on increasing the standard of living for families. As Tom Dusevic said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 20 April, when he was reporting on an EPAC report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income distribution in Australia: recent trends and research</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and the fact that average material living standards per capita have risen by almost 30 per cent under Labor . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Although he notes that there has been the income disparity that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) talked about, this is a worldwide trend that has been affected by technological change, globalisation, internationalisation and more women in the work force. I note the very positive numbers in today's employment growth figures. Women are the real winners in long-term employment by today's figures&mdash;80,000 of them. They are getting the jobs and they are out there helping to support their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to remind ourselves when  this argument about income disparity is brought up that many policies of this Labor government over the last 11 years have made sure that we have minimised that disparity. The social affairs correspondent for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> mentions some of these things in his article. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Awards and minimum wage arrangements have retarded the development of a "working poor" in Australia. And when wider measures of income are used&mdash;taking into account our well-targeted social security payments, progressive tax system, high rates of home ownership and the whole range of social wage benefits such as health and education&mdash;inequality is slightly less pronounced.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the backdrop to this 1995 budget. I think we should be very clear about the fact that it is a very balanced way to provide in an economically responsible way for the future of this country. We have just heard from a front bench spokesperson for the opposition, someone who would have carriage in a Liberal-National Party government. The only thing he could do was talk and worry about very small ticket items in this budget. It has been a Labor government that has bitten the bullet on national savings, on superannuation, to make a real difference for the future of this country, for the families of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about the families of this country, our agenda for families and the specific things we have brought in with this budget are a very proud part of a long-term strategy to make sure that families are at the centrepiece of our policies. It is very pleasing to see that Father David Cappo, who was on the International Year of the Family Council and who is the national director of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, agrees wholeheartedly with us. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well the Superannuation savings plan should provide a strategy for dignified retirement incomes for low income families. And an important aspect of the new Social Justice Strategy is the use of new funding ($247m) in the Better Cities Program that will also attack the alarming growth in locational poverty traps in Australia,"</PARA>
<PARA>He says further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This budget should also help prevent further damage to family life in Australia by staving off another interest rate rise. And deflecting tax increases away from those families most in need in a tight fiscal era is a social justice achievement to be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me just outline some of those excellent initiatives that we have brought in in this budget. Might I also say that we have delivered on every 1993 election promise for families and women. We are about announcing policies and then carrying them through. Let us look at some of the excellent initiatives in this budget that will further our agenda for families. The first one is the maternity allowance that will give women and families greater financial support, at least $816, at that very difficult time when a new baby comes into the family. That will make a significant difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In child care we are freeing up 31,000 places, targeting those for the needs of working mothers. One initiative that I am particularly pleased about is that families in rural and remote areas will benefit from $7 1/2 million for 500 innovative child-care places. This has been applauded by rural women all across Australia. This is a very important issue. The needs of families in rural and remote areas are being attended to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children with special needs will get $17 million over four years. We have a continuing commitment to provide child-care places and 12,000 new family day care places are part of this budget policy. Eight thousand new places in community based centres and 40,000 new outside school hour places are to be achieved by 1999. In fact, we will be spending $12 billion in direct assistance to families, including of course services like education and Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Everyone, including companies, knows only too well that profit share for companies has been the highest it has been in a long time. Paul Simons, the Chairman of Woolworths, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have only had the 33 per cent rate for a couple of years but now it is back into the middle ground which is where, perhaps, it should have been all along.</PARA>
<PARA>When they stop being political about it, companies that have had high profit share will know that they have a responsibility to contribute to this economy and to the welfare of families. At the end of the day, low interest rates will make a difference to the houses of all families in this country, to the jobs that are available and to small business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>We have before us today a range of Senate amendments to the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill, which was introduced into this House some time ago by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). Since the government initiated this legislation, there have been attempts based on misleading information to misrepresent the impact of the legislation. The government remains committed to this bill and its intentions. The opposition's amendments have largely come from vested interest groups. Its amendments are designed to represent its sectional interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA and procedural specialists continue to mislead people about the effect of the proposed changes. Some groups have claimed that the legislation makes it compulsory for doctors to contract with funds. There is no compulsion with respect to doctor contracts. I challenge any of the groups to point to a clause which can possibly be construed as compelling doctors to contract. Patients will retain their freedom of choice when choosing their doctor or hospital. The difference will be that either there will be no costs or, if there are out-of-pocket costs, patients will know exactly what they are up for if they choose a contracted doctor. That is the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If insured people are treated by a doctor under contract, they will be covered for some and possibly all above-schedule charges. If they are treated by an uncontracted doctor, they will be in exactly the same situation as they are now: Medicare will pay 75 per cent of the scheduled fee, their health fund will pay 25 per cent of the scheduled fee and patients will be responsible for any above-schedule charges. That is very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been claims that all existing private health insurance products will be abolished. Again, this is simply not the case. Funds will be able to continue to offer all the products they offer now, and they will have the freedom to offer new products such as eliminating medical out-of-pocket costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most absurd claim is that the reforms will lead to a reduction in the quality of care. Nobody from the doctor lobby has explained how this will happen. It just chants this like a mantra. Quality of care remains in the hands of the doctors. They will continue to decide all aspects of clinical treatment. The legislation does not interfere in their role in any way. Doctors seem to equate quality of care with the size of the out-of-pocket charge the patient meets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Benefits will still be paid to 100 per cent of the MBS fee for in-hospital treatment for doctors who choose not to contract. Hospital contracts will also provide cost certainty for patients. Hospitals will also have a guaranteed default benefit if there is no contract with a health fund. All reforms to the health system are initially opposed by doctors, but later those sensible reforms, like Medicare itself, are embraced at least by the progressive elements of the profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hospital contracts will also provide cost certainty for patients, and hospitals will have a guaranteed default benefit if there is no contract with a health fund. This bill will provide increased flexibility for patients, a better health insurance product and better value for money. The issues have been debated exhaustively in the media and in the other place for hours. The government considers the reforms in this bill are essential to a healthy and competitive health insurance industry, and we seek to finalise this legislation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments passed by the Senate clarify the legislation and make the intent of the legislation even more transparent. The key amendments, first, require health insurance funds to provide psychiatric and rehabilitation coverage; secondly, ensure that stamp duty will not be payable on contracts covered under this legislation; and, thirdly, ensure that where industrial agreements exist employer-employee health benefit schemes are protected for a grandfather period until 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the reforms to be passed by the House today are essential if the private health industry is to survive and prosper into the next century. I commend these amendments to the House. They are long overdue. It is time we got on with this process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commiserate with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) on his illness. I think he should probably sack his doctor. I will not make many comments on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill because it has been extensively debated in the other place. But I will just say a few things for the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is opposing this legislation. Back in February I said that our specific concerns about the legislation were: ensuring an adequately available default benefit, taking reasonable measures to protect sensitivity and privacy of patient data, and adequate provisions for the operation of the Trade Practices Act. That was a pretty wide gate that the government could have driven through had it wanted to and it was conceivable that it could have had coalition support for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the measures before parliament at the moment are the wrong prescription for private health insurance. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has made much of the ability of the bill to offer coverage for out-of-pocket expenses. But she has completely failed to address the main reason people drop out of private health insurance; and that is cost. Sixty-four per cent of people who drop their private health insurance do so because of the cost of premiums. Those premiums have gone up progressively over a decade because the government took $100 million out of the reinsurance pool, because the government ended the bed day subsidy and because the government reduced the Medicare rebate for in-patient services from 85 per cent to 75 per cent&mdash;and expected the funds to pick up the tab every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we now have a situation where we have an accelerating rate of decrease of fund membership&mdash;2.1 per cent last year; and 64 per cent of them are doing it because of cost. Fifteen per cent of people drop out of private health insurance because of the gap. The average gap is actually $80 per episode. So this whole complex legislation and the whole process we have been through may address problems for 15 per cent of people, at an average cost of $80 per episode, but it will not address the main problem. I make the prediction here today: should the Labor Party be re-elected we will be looking at 30 per cent of the population with private health insurance coverage by December 1997. It could actually be less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Trade Practices Act, I think it is important that I read into the record some comments by Bob Baxt. Bob Baxt was Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission; he was a Labor Party appointment. He has made some particularly relevant comments on this legislation. In a letter dated 27 March 1995 he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should indicate that I favour the general implementation of the Hilmer Report which is to be considered at COAG on 3 and 4 April. But at the same time I have always stressed the importance in government "hastening slowly" in extending the reach of the Trade Practices Act. A bolder approach may result in greater damage being created than the benefits that might flow from the adoption of the Trade Practices Act. The New Zealand experience in a number of areas where there has been a broad, universal and speedy application of competition policy to areas previously tightly regulated, has been less than satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard the Australian Government's policy on telecommunications is a classic example of a "hastening slowly" approach. This has achieved and is likely to continue to achieve, greater good in the short and long term than if the Government were to adopt the type of approach that was embraced by the New Zealand Government . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My major concern . . . is the blind acceptance of the proposition that the Commission, by using the Trade Practices Act, will be able to overcome any unfair or improper conduct on the part of powerful health funds, powerful hospitals or other powerful players in the health industry, acting either alone or together.</PARA>
<PARA>He then talks about the authorisation process that the government places much store on. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the authorization process is also a costly and time consuming one. Hank Spier in his evidence suggests that an authorization may be dealt with effectively in two to three months. Whilst this may be true in certain areas of the economy where the Commission has had considerable experience, I would suggest that in this industry a much longer time period is relevant. It could take six to nine months before some of these matters are effectively dealt with by the Commission. Furthermore there is always a chance that the Commission's decision may be appealed to the Trade Practices Tribunal&mdash;this has recently happened in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newsagents</EMPHASIS> case where from start to finish the whole process took over 2 1/2 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Baxt finishes off with this warning:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need to reflect on the considerable damage that might be caused in a very short time by the misuse of market power, or other unfair conduct which might occur in a scenario where the Commission, and others, will find that the Trade Practices Act does not offer the kind of protection that has been assumed will be available to the relevant participants.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of perhaps the most experienced person in the country on the Trade Practices Act. That is the warning he gives the government on the operation of the act. He was the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission for four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concerns have not been met. I have absolutely no hesitation in voting against this legislation. The minister has talked much about putting consumers first. If funds that have as much as 70 per cent of market power in one state misuse that market power, irreparable damage will be done to the private health sector. We are not against a notion of reform. Some reform is needed in this area, but it needs to be done in a sensible, commonsense, non-ideological way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When three major groups&mdash;the doctors, the hospitals and half the insurers&mdash;are opposing this you have to think you have it wrong. The fact is that you do have it wrong. Because, as the minister said, the contracts are voluntary&mdash;and we have never portrayed anything different&mdash;I do not think people will take them up. At best, this will be a flop; at worst, you will actually do damage. It will be a flop. People will not take it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could have had something that would have worked, but you are incapable of negotiating or addressing legitimate concerns of medical specialists and private hospitals. In the end, we will get what I think will be an unworkable piece of legislation. It is not the way we would have approached the problems of private health insurance. We certainly reserve the right to review and amend these measures in government because, in the end, we will have to pick up the pieces of this mess. </PARA>

It is a significant issue and one in which the difficulties may have been brought home to the government in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not convinced that the statement in the explanatory memorandum that a minimal number of people are liable for the visa tax is correct. According to the June 1994 figures, the amount of money owing by unlawful citizens under the provisions of the visa tax act is conservatively estimated at in excess of $850 million. It would be foolish to suggest that that amount or anything like it could be collected. The amount in question is far from minimal, even on a most conservative estimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another way to look at it is to look at the results of the efforts of the government in identifying unlawful non-citizens in the financial year 1993-94. During that year, as I indicated earlier, more than 16,000 were located and nearly 9,000 were the subject of enforced departures, leaving approximately 7,500 who were not dealt with by the coercive measure. If the 7,500 were identified and were to pay only one year's tax at $3,000, the amount collected would be about $18 million. In the context of the government's budget that is not a large sum, but in the context of the government's enforcement program it represents roughly 50 per cent of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures I have been quoting were provided to my  office as late as this morning as the latest figures available to the department. It is my understanding that as yet no-one has been taxed under the provisions of the visa tax act. I assume that in the nine months since September several thousand have been identified and of those a substantial proportion was not deported. The question the government might answer is: why was no tax collected?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not readily apparent to me that the government is in any position, having regard to the length of time the act has been in force, to decide that the aims of the visa tax act have or have not been achieved. If the government is in such a position, it has not provided any evidence upon which this House could reach a similar judgment. This is really an example of the government's legislative incompetence or its administrative incompetence or both. It has decided to go down a certain path to achieve a policy goal and it is now pulling the plug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government states in the explanatory memorandum that it has subsequently become apparent that the objectives of the visa tax act are already being achieved through other current legislative and procedural mechanisms. I invite an answer to the question as to what these legislative mechanisms and procedural mechanisms are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons given for the change of approach are hardly credible. What is the minister's real reason for wanting retrospectively to repeal the visa tax act? Will the government tell the people what it really is up to? The information available presently suggests that the government really has no idea what it is doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank all of the speakers who contributed to the debate and the opposition for supporting the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) before the House. A number of questions were raised, and I feel it is only right that I should at least reply to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Tangney (Mr Williams) was concerned about the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act. I believe the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) also touched on that very briefly. Can I just say that, even though they have extrapolated a lot of figures which sound good, like all figures they are not always accurate. We are repealing the Migration (Delayed Visa Applications) Tax Act because, first and foremost, as with all immigration matters, it is moving legislation. We must change as society changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members opposite were concerned that some people would qualify and some would not and that some would be responsible for the payment. I can assure them that not everybody would be. If they studied the immigration debate that we have had over the last three to four years, they would see how many changes have been put into place. We as a government now find that it is quite irrelevant to have this particular procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now our offshore decision makers, who are very carefully considering all applications for both visitor and temporary visas, with a view to reducing the incidence of overstaying. We have also put in place the provisions in the Migration Reform Act 1992 relating to the recovery of cost. We have only very few classes of visas that would enable successful applications from persons unlawfully in Australia. I wanted to touch on that for the benefit of the honourable member for Tangney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In compassionate circumstances the implementation of a visa tax certainly would not be appropriate. There is certainly no doubt in the mind of the government and the community at large that that has served its term. What we have put in place over time with the amendments to the Migration Reform Act is certainly a lot better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Berowra was very concerned about the changes to the 816 and 818 visa class and the effect that would have on adult migrant education and the availability of English languages. He also quoted figures, but I can assure him that the figures he quoted were a little incorrect. We have, at this stage, 432 principal applicants who have entered into the AMEP in the language area. When one considers how many actual visas have been issued, that is a very small number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must in this legislation make it very clear that those people who were granted those visas had adequate knowledge of the English language. To now, because of an anomaly in the act, take up the extra space in the AMEP with other classes is both illogical and, as far as the government is concerned, never part of the visa classification. That is what the amendments will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as we are concerned, it is very difficult to get from the department a rough estimate of the potential approval rate of the 11,000 people who have already been granted that particular class of visa, but I reiterate that only 432 have accessed the AMEP. We are saying that they should not have access to that program. It is quite illogical to have a passage in the legislation that would allow them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other matter that I want to touch on relates to passenger cards. I inform the member for Berowra and the opposition that the legislation makes it mandatory for everyone to fill in the visa passenger cards when re-entering this country. We are putting these amendments into the legislation to give us a more flexible and sensible approach. At the moment, it is mandatory that they fill in those cards. We are saying that it should not have to be that way. People make visa applications and in those applications they provide all of their details relating to such things as their health and character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that with multiple entries into this country circumstances may change so there will still be a certain number of questions still left unanswered on the card. We have to retain the health and character questions because they will be necessary in relation to New Zealanders. As members know, when New Zealand citizens enter Australia they are granted a very special category of visa subject to meeting certain conditions and the application for the grant of that category of visa. It should be noted that the questions on the passenger card apply to all incoming non-citizens and not just New Zealanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have very quickly tried to answer a few of the concerns that were raised during the debate. I am sure I will be given other opportunities to speak on this matter when we make further amendments to the Migration Reform Act. In closing, I say to all those who expressed concern that this is Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5). That is how many amendments we have had to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a progressive government but, most importantly, we are listening to the concerns of the community at large and what is happening both in our department here and in our embassies overseas. I think we have to make sure, at all times, in relation to immigration legislation, that it is not set in concrete and that it is flexible enough to meet amendments and changes in society. That is what this bill is about. It is meeting the concerns of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in recommendations 10 and 11. But, most particularly, it is meeting the concerns of the community. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I became Leader of the Opposition, only three months ago, I said within a very short time that the great bulk of Australians believed that after the worst recession in 60 years they had enjoyed but five minutes of economic sunshine before the economic sky started falling in again. I know by their constant reaction that those who sit opposite do not like that little analogy. They do not like it because it sums up what the great majority of Australians throughout this nation really believe. That is why they do not like it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the great majority of Australians do feel like that at present, although regrettably, for reasons that I hope everybody understands, there is one section of the Australian community&mdash;namely, the farming section&mdash;and many others who live throughout rural Australia who do not even believe, because of the prolonged drought, that they have even enjoyed five minutes of economic sunshine. They believe they are a section of the community that for four long years suffered a drought before the Keating government recognised their plight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sense that after such a very short period of time the economic sky began to fall in again really did encapsulate how the great majority of people throughout the Australian mainstream felt. They felt that way after the worst recession in 60 years. They felt that way because of the neglect of a part-time Prime Minister (Mr Keating), because after 12 years and now 13 budgets a problem which grows worse by the year has not been effectively addressed. That sense of only five minutes of economic sunshine encapsulated the sense of drift, the sense of insecurity, the sense of concern and the sense of apprehension felt by so many Australians throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another reason for it, too. They have grown weary of being led by a Prime Minister whose only stock-in-trade is dishonest hyperbole. They have grown weary of being told that budgets are going to bring home the bacon. They have grown weary of being told that they have never had it so good. They have grown weary of being told that they will get tax cuts, only to see them snatched away after the re-election of the Labor government. That is why I believe that the great majority of the Australian community have reacted in a negative fashion to this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real test of this budget is the extent to which it has been able to dislodge that sense of despondency, that sense of concern felt by so many people in mainstream Australia. But before I deal with my assessment of whether this year's budget has passed that test, has cleared that hurdle, let me say something about the context of my reply to the budget. There seems to be this curious notion opposite, entertained by the Prime Minister and others, that tonight is the occasion on which we reveal all of our policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, they laugh. But isn't it interesting that, if you go through the budget, the item that has attracted the most attention in the last 24 hours is the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Do you remember 10 years ago when the Liberal Party advocated the sale of the Commonwealth Bank? Do you know what Paul Keating and Bob Hawke said? They said they would fight the sale of the Commonwealth Bank to the last drop of Labor blood. They said that, while there was a light on the hill, they would fight it to the bitter end. They said that Ben Chifley would spin in his grave if anybody contemplated selling it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, do you know what? All those fine Labor principles, all that heroic rhetoric, counted for nought when they wanted the dough to produce a fraudulent balance. Let me just make one thing clear about coalition policy&mdash;and I make it very clear to the Australian people: coalition policy will be revealed at a time of our choosing, not Paul Keating's nomination. The responses to the budget speech conform to a number of categories. The first and most prominent of the category of responses to the budget is that the budget contains, without any exaggeration, a litany of dishonoured and broken promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and the worst of those broken promises is the final repudiation of the much vaunted One Nation tax cuts. The Prime Minister went to the last election knowing in his heart that the Australian nation could not afford the unfunded tax promises that he made. So deceitful was he that he even concealed from his senior ministers his decision to promise all of those One Nation tax cuts when he made his infamous l-a-w, law, promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, in case anybody imagines that that is just a piece of opposition hyperbole, that that is just a piece of Liberal Party propaganda, let me remind you of the damning condemnation of the Prime Minister from the former Secretary to the Treasury, Tony Cole, only last Monday night when he said that the Prime Minister's office had deliberately falsified the economic forecast in the One Nation statement&mdash;caught red-handed; deliberately falsified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it did not stop there. We then come to a little thing called a company tax reduction which was promised at the time of the last election. I remember seeing the Prime Minister deliver that speech. He said, `The only way that we can get Australian companies working for Australia is to reduce their rate of company tax by 6c.' He stood up there and he promised it. He said, `This is the centrepiece; this is the heart of the government's economic policy, the heart of the government's business revival policy.' What has the government done two years later? It said, `Oh, we'll take it back, we'll just take it back like that.' That promise accounted for absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the increase in the Medicare levy. The Medicare levy is going up from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Anybody who knows anything about the operation of the Australian health system must know that it is sheer lunacy to increase the cost of being in the Medicare system without compensating adjustments in relation to private insurance. The greatest problem with Australia's medical system is the drain of people out of private health insurance, the haemorrhaging of private health insurance. Unless something is done to fix that, you are going to put further pressure on the public hospital system. And by driving up the Medicare levy without any compensating adjustments, you are going to put further pressure on the public hospital system. I have already dealt with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not content with breaking promises made before the last election, not content with dishonestly repudiating most of the promises made in the recent election campaign, the government wanted to go a bit further. It looked around and said, `Right. We will see if we can increase the price of a new home for young home buyers in Australia.' It decided to impose not a one per cent tax or a two per cent tax but a 12 per cent tax on home building materials, which will add something like $2,500 to $3,000 to the cost of a new home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that still was not enough. It decided to increase the sales tax on cars by five per cent. The reality is that the tax increases in this budget represent the biggest hike in tax collection of any Commonwealth budget since the second Keating budget in 1984. Taxation collections are going to rise by almost nine per cent in real terms in this budget. You have to go back to the Keating budget of 1984 and before that to a Whitlam budget more than 20 years ago to get a rise in the taxation collections that equals this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it very clear to the House and to the Australian public that the coalition will vote against in both houses of parliament the rise in company tax, will vote against the new 12 per cent tax on home building materials, will vote against the five per cent rise in car sales tax and will vote against the rise in the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those taxes violate the pre-election promises that were made by the Prime Minister and the government. All of them constitute straight electoral fraud and straight electoral dishonesty. We will also oppose the attempt by the government to undermine the independent contractor system by dragging them into the PAYE tax net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real fiscal outcome of the 1995 budget is not the surplus of $770 million talked about by the Prime Minister. The real fiscal outcome&mdash;and you can find it if you are patient enough to read through the documents right to the end&mdash;is actually a deficit of $8.2 billion. Everybody knows that this glittering surplus, as it would like people to believe, is being achieved by the essentially fraudulent devices of including the asset sales in the budget figuring. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take a leaf out of the Treasurer's book. I would like the Australian public to have a look at the underlying deficit, and I can tell you that the underlying deficit is $8.2 billion. That is why financial markets have seen through this budget, and that is why financial markets have not given you the enormous boost that you were hoping for. That is why the negative reaction with the Australian dollar has been to the measure and the order that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the sectors of the Australian community that is being hardest hit by this budget is the small business sector. I will illustrate one of the things that has happened to the small business community since this government came to power. When this government came to power, this was the size of the income tax act in Australia. Twelve years later, this is the size of the income tax act in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you people opposite understood anything about the operation of a small business, you would understand the enormous paper burden that that kind of burgeoning of the tax act has imposed. Not only have you given them that, you have increased their taxation, you have extended the PAYE tax system and you have imposed an absurd provisional tax uplift factor on them. You are imposing new charges via the Reserve Bank. As David Murray, the managing director of the Commonwealth Bank, said in this morning's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, higher interest rate charges will be a result of those new charges and taxes imposed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost the ninth anniversary of an interview the then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, gave on the John Laws program when he declared that unless something were done about Australia's chronic current account deficit this country would become a banana republic. One of the reasons the Australian public is so cynical about you lot opposite, and one of the reasons the Australian public wants to have a change of government, is that nine years later you have done nothing to cure that problem, by the Prime Minister's own admission. In a speech he gave to the Monash University only a short period of time ago, the Prime Minister said that the current account deficit remained Australia's most intractable economic problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You pretend that your budget has done something to fix the current account deficit problem. Why is it, then, that you forecast that the current account deficit next year will still be 5.5 per cent of the gross domestic product? Why is it that it will still be the second worst current account deficit in the industrialised world? Why is it that, after nine years of recognising that unless something were done about the current account deficit this country would become a banana republic, you have failed to do anything about it? It remains our biggest challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons it remains our biggest challenge is that this government, particularly under the stewardship of Paul Keating as Prime Minister, has gone to sleep on the job of economic modernisation. Some things were done in the early years of this government, under the prime ministership of Bob Hawke. There were one or two things, but they were done a long time ago.

Even your mate Bob Carr, a recently elected Labor Premier, says that the unfair dismissal provisions Laurie Brereton introduced after the last election act as a brake on employment. It is the complete failure of this government under the stewardship of Keating to do anything serious about micro-economic reform which is the major reason the great problem with the current account deficit has not been tackled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, our position on labour market reform remains clear as a strong, effective alternative. The coalition will reform Australia's arthritic labour market. We will bring about genuine workplace bargaining. The goal of that policy is higher real wages through higher productivity. We will bring balanced unfair dismissal laws. We will not tolerate an unfair dismissal law that actually works as a disincentive for thousands of small businesses throughout Australia to take on more staff. We will do something about Australia's antiquated and out-of-date transport and communications infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can carry on. You can laugh and guffaw but you cannot laugh and guffaw at the fact that in those areas Australia remains well below world best practice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the catch-up politics that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have played in this budget is in the area of family policy. I welcome, on behalf of the opposition, the introduction of the maternity allowance. I might observe in passing that one aspect of that maternity allowance was in fact a response to opposition pressure&mdash;pressure to make certain that the maternity allowance applied not only to mothers in the paid work force but also to mothers in the unpaid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to say on behalf of the opposition that family policy ought not to be a footnote to industrial relations negotiation between the government and the ACTU. Every time you look at family policy it is not in the context of sitting down and looking at how families are affected by the behaviour of government in all its aspects and manifestations but rather it is a question of how you can skew family policy, how you can mould the needs and concerns of family policy, to suit the rigidity of the industrial relations system. Instead of families being skewed to suit the industrial relations system, the industrial relations system ought to be skewed to suit the needs and the interests of Australian families. So family policy will not be a function of negotiations with the ACTU but will cover all aspects of government policy under the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many things said about the Prime Minister of this country, and not too many have been complimentary. I thought one of the more interesting things that has been said about the Prime Minister was said last weekend in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It was an article written by Donald Horne, who is a former Chairman of the Australia Council. He is not a noted apologist for the Liberal Party. It is fairly well known that Donald Horne does not really agree with me on quite a number of issues of significant debate in Australia at the present time. It was a very interesting and lengthy article about the attitude of the Prime Minister towards arts policy. This is what Donald Horne had to say in the article. He was quoting a conversation with the Prime Minister, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one of the delights of office was to be sitting up here in the front at Opera in the Park, with the sandwiches and champagne, instead of being out there with the mob, sharing a Mars bar.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, encapsulates very accurately the arrogance of the Prime Minister, an arrogance that people understand and have come to have contempt for over a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has now happened is that it is not only the arrogance of the Prime Minister that the Australian public is unhappy with, it is not only a failure of style; it is also a failure of substance. This budget, in its inadequate response to Australia's economic problems, is a prime example of the failure of not only prime ministerial style but also prime ministerial substance. Many people would acknowledge that arrogance is always offensive, but perhaps it becomes bearable if the person exhibiting the arrogance has something to be arrogant about. </PARA>

I do not think the man who gave us the highest debt levels since the Great Depression has anything to be arrogant about. I do not think the person who gave us the highest unemployment since the Great Depression has anything to be arrogant about. I do not think the man who gave us the highest sustained levels of interest rates has anything to be arrogant about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The moratorium was imposed both to undertake a review of the policy and procedures in relation to the Civil Marriage Celebrant Program and to allow consideration of a very large waiting list of applications for possible appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the moratorium was imposed, the procedure in relation to appointments was for cyclical reviews of federal electorate areas each three years taking into consideration the number of celebrants already appointed to the electorate. Existing celebrants were asked for their views on the need for further appointments. Many suitable applicants were not appointed when account was taken of the location and views of existing celebrants and this led to the accumulation of a large waiting list of applicants. The moratorium is providing an opportunity to clear the waiting list, make more celebrants available to the community, giving greater public choice and access, and introduce more efficient administrative procedures to the program.</PARA>

The Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) will then receive all of the annual draw down of $45 million (indexed).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Since 1 January 1994 there have been 61 claims for native title lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal.
