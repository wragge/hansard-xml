<PARA>The Russell Office complex is the administrative centre and headquarters of the Australian Defence Force. Most of the existing buildings were constructed during the 1950s and the 1960s and are not suitable for refurbishment to provide the modern office accommodation required by Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposed works eight of the older buildings will be demolished, four buildings will be refurnished and three new office buildings will be built. The complex is located at the third apex of the national triangle, and the proposed redevelopment includes roadworks that the National Capital Planning Authority sees as necessary to complete the triangle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 29 March 1995, concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that it proceed, subject to the following recommendations. Firstly, the redevelopment should proceed, provided the agreed amendment of the national capital plan amendment No. 12 Russell does not require changes to the design and siting of roadworks and buildings. Secondly, if the agreed amendment to the national capital plan&mdash;that is, amendment No. 12 Russell&mdash;requires changes to the proposed redevelopment, these changes will need to be considered by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the provision of space for a senior officers suite should be reallocated for more essential services. Fourthly, the Department of Defence should proceed with the study of the impact on the staff efficiency and productivity of open office space and other forms of office accommodation as a matter of urgency. Fifthly, further value management studies should be undertaken to reduce the cost of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence agrees to all of the above recommendations and will institute measures to conform and, where appropriate, report back to the Public Works Committee. A draft amendment to the national capital plan was prepared to create sites for the new buildings proposed. It was considered by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories which reported to the parliament on 5 June 1995. The report recommends that the draft amendment be approved, subject to several recommendations. The Defence development is affected only by some of the recommendations, and Defence accepts those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that construction for the project will commence in July of 1995 and be completed by the end of the year 2000.

<PARA>Melbourne airport, the second busiest airport in Australia, is subject to continuing growth and passenger movements. As a consequence, the present short-term car park is suffering severe congestion and frequent closure. As this growth in passenger numbers is forecast to continue for the foreseeable future, it is necessary for the corporation, in order to provide an appropriate level of service to its customers, to increase the capacity of the short-term car park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 1 June 1995 recommending the project at an estimated cost of $55 million. In its report, the committee raised a number of issues to which the FAC has provided the following responses. The FAC has arranged as part of its contract with the project manager for design and construction for a thorough re-evaluation of the concept design for the car park which was considered by the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The re-evaluation will involve a review of a range of considerations, including the location, size and performance requirements for the links between the car park and the terminal&mdash;in particular, the width of these links, which is directly related to the consideration of the provision of the moving walkways within them; the location of the hotel car park and future rail station locations and the interrelationships between them to ensure the final site selections represent the best planning outcome for the airport; and a design development process which includes close consultation with the airlines on all design issues, including the location and functionality of the proposed loading dock and associated service tunnel connecting the loading dock to the terminal. </PARA>

<PARA>The aim of the proposal is to provide an increase in the current living-in accommodation on the base from 232 personnel to a total of 428 and to replace the existing, unsuitable and substandard accommodation for 54.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the superannuation policy statement of 28 June 1994. In that statement, the Treasurer outlined several major initiatives to enhance the government's retirement incomes policy and to alleviate the small amounts problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the measures in the bill, such as the employee share scheme provisions, are new and largely self-contained. These have been drafted in the new tax law improvement style. Other measures in the bill either amend existing provisions of the law or interrelate with concepts already contained in other parts of the law; for example, the late lodgment penalty and interest provisions. For these reasons, it has not been possible to fully adopt the new drafting style as this would entail changes to a much broader range of provisions. The tax law improvement project will be redrafting the tax law over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Employee share schemes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to provide a new income tax regime for the taxation of employee share schemes. The new regime will generally apply from 6 p.m. in the ACT&mdash;and the equivalent time elsewhere&mdash;on 28 March 1995. Transitional arrangements will apply so that, in certain circumstances, the existing provisions of the income tax law will continue to apply to shares or rights to shares acquired after the date of commencement of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is making these changes to reduce the exploitation of the existing legislation and to ensure that the tax concessions that are available under the new arrangements are directed at share schemes which encourage employees to own shares in the company in which they are employed or a holding company of the employer. The measures will increase the taxation benefits available to employees under these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount to be included in a taxpayer's assessable income in respect of the shares and rights acquired will be the difference between the value of the share or right and any amount paid by the taxpayer to acquire the share or right. Generally, the amount is to be included in assessable income in the year that the share or right is acquired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in certain circumstances, a deferral of taxation of up to five years without any upper limit on amount will be available. Conditions have to be satisfied before a share or right qualifies for the deferral concession. The share or right must be acquired under an employee share scheme. At the time the share or right is acquired, or at an earlier time, each permanent employee should have been entitled to acquire shares or rights of the employer or holding company of the employer. The shares or rights should be ordinary shares or rights of the employer or holding company. The employee should also not hold more than five per cent of shares or voting rights of the employer company or holding company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exemption concession will apply for certain shares or rights that are issued to employees under a scheme operated on a non-discriminatory basis. The employee can elect that the discount received be included in his or her assessable income in the income year in which the shares or rights are acquired. Where this election is made, benefits up to a limit of $500 for an income year will be exempt from tax. If the exemption concession applies, the provider of the benefit will be entitled to a tax deduction for up to $500 of benefits provided to each employee. This deduction will apply if the deduction is not allowable under the other provisions of the tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also amend the capital gains provisions and the fringe benefits tax law to ensure that there is no double taxation of share or right benefits. The nature of these measures is such that a reliable estimate of the revenue impact cannot be provided. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Capital gains tax&mdash;rollover relief for merging superannuation funds</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the capital gains tax, CGT, provisions to allow certain superannuation funds which merge to defer any CGT gains or losses that would be realised at the time of the merger on the assets transferred. Although the government remains of the view that CGT should, in general, be payable on assets realised when entities merge, it considers that special circumstances exist that justify this concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the government recognises that the new member protection rules may put greater pressure on superannuation funds to merge to improve their economies of operation. It also realises that current CGT rules may affect the short-term liquidity of such superannuation funds. This temporary relief will improve the efficiency and performance of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will apply to superannuation funds that merge on or after 1 July 1994 and before 1 July 1997. The notional cost to the revenue from the proposal is estimated to be $50 million for each of the three years of its operation. The actual cost to the revenue will be less because many funds would not merge if rollover relief was not available. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation guarantee&mdash;jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill clarifies the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, AIRC. It is generally accepted that the operation of the superannuation guarantee legislation has not affected the jurisdiction, powers or functions of the AIRC. However, there is no express statement in the superannuation guarantee legislation or the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, and because there has been doubt expressed in some quarters concerning the power of the AIRC to continue to arbitrate on superannuation, the amendment makes it clear that the superannuation guarantee legislation does not alter in any way the substantive jurisdiction, functions and powers of the AIRC. The amendment will apply from the commencement of the superannuation guarantee law on 1 July 1992. The amendment has no impact on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation guarantee&mdash;flat dollar contributions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the superannuation guarantee law to ensure that the percentage level of superannuation support actually provided for an employee for flat dollar contributions is calculated based on actual contributions, rather than the amount specified in the award. The current provision causes problems where contributions differ from the award amount. The effect of the amendment will be to make it easier for some employers to satisfy their superannuation guarantee requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will take effect from 1 July 1994. There is no cost to the revenue from the change. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation guarantee&mdash;local government councillors</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to generally exempt from the superannuation guarantee law the payments received by local government councillors in the course of their duties. The payments will not be regarded as salary and wages for superannuation guarantee purposes, enabling councillors to claim deductions under the income tax legislation for any personal superannuation contributions. The exemption will not apply to payments from certain local government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government councillors will retain their status as employees for the purposes of the superannuation industry supervisory legislation to prevent some funds which have councillors as members from being treated as public offer funds, which entails higher compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will apply from 1 July 1993. Cost to the revenue in the 1994-95 and subsequent years will be less than $500,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation&mdash;various amendments to the income tax law</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Security in Retirement statement of 30 June 1992, the government has introduced a number of changes to the income tax law to encourage superannuation pensions and annuities, and to ensure that superannuation moneys are kept within the superannuation system until withdrawal. This bill makes some minor adjustments to some of these changes to clarify their operation and further ease administrative requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the bill changes the income tax law to ensure that superannuation pension and rollover annuity recipients who started receiving a pension or annuity before 1 July 1994 will be able to change providers without losing tax concessions. This change will allow pensioners and annuitants to move their investment without being disadvantaged by a different tax treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the income tax law to ensure that tax concessions for employer superannuation contributions are restricted to superannuation funds established primarily for the benefit of employees. The amendments are not expected to have any significant impact on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Superannuation&mdash;miscellaneous amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes a small number of miscellaneous amendments to superannuation law administered by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. The two main amendments allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to undertake statistical surveys of the superannuation industry and change the method of collection of the superannuation supervisory levy. As a result, the manner in which the late payment penalty for the levy is calculated is also changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes some other more technical amendments. No overall impact on revenue is expected to result from these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">State and territory bodies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments in the bill will create broad new exemptions from income tax and sales tax for certain state and territory bodies. These amendments arise from an agreement reached at the 1994 Premiers Conference, which aims to promote efficiency and competitive neutrality in markets in which state and territory trading enterprises operate. One aspect of this is removing the tax advantage enjoyed by state and territory trading enterprises over private businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was agreed that the tax advantage could be eliminated if the states and territories imposed tax equivalent regimes on their trading enterprises. A tax equivalent regime is basically equivalent to Commonwealth income tax and sales tax in its principles and the rates imposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before tax equivalent regimes are introduced, the states and territories need to be certain that their trading enterprises will be exempt from Commonwealth income tax and sales tax. Certain state and territory bodies will, therefore, be made clearly exempt. Some bodies will be specifically excluded from the exemption, including bodies prescribed by regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will not change the tax status of many of these bodies. For the 1994-95 year, the bodies which were taxable at the time of the 1994 Premiers Conference will remain taxable. These bodies will in most cases become exempt from 1 July 1995. The amendments are expected to be revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Late lodgment penalty</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces a new penalty regime for late lodgment of income tax returns. The penalties will apply to 1994-95 and later year returns where the due date for lodgment occurs after the later of 30 June 1995 or 60 days after the date of royal assent of the bill. Companies, superannuation funds and certain trusts will be liable for a flat rate penalty of $25 for each week that a return remains outstanding up to a maximum of $500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All other taxpayers who are late in lodging an income tax return will be liable for additional tax of eight per cent per annum on the amount of net tax payable for the year of income. In addition, they will also be liable for interest on the net tax payable at the same rate that applies to underpayments and late payments of income tax. That interest rate is currently 10.8 per cent per annum. The additional tax and interest will be calculated from the due date for lodgment until the return is lodged. A reliable estimate of the impact on the revenue cannot be provided. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Refunds of tax file number amounts deducted in error</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also amend the income tax law in a number of respects to ease compliance costs encountered by investment bodies when they are required to refund tax incorrectly deducted by them because of a mistake concerning an investor's tax file number. One amendment limits the refunds to be made by investment bodies to requests for refunds received on or before 15 July following the year of income in which the incorrect deduction of tax file number amounts occurred. This will reduce investment body tax compliance costs associated with refunds that they are presently required to make in respect of amounts deducted in earlier years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any incorrectly deducted amounts not refunded by the investment body within the 15 July time frame would normally be allowed as a credit to the investor upon assessment of the investor's tax return for the relevant income year. However, where it is not reasonably appropriate for an investor to wait until an assessment has been issued, the Commissioner of Taxation will be required to make refunds directly to an investor. This will ensure that an avenue for a refund is always available to an investor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment will provide for investment bodies to choose to offset any amounts that they refund against other amounts they deduct during the same year. This will also reduce compliance costs for investment bodies. These amendments will have no impact on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Pensions, allowances and benefits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the mature age partner allowance was introduced, it was exempted from income tax. This is inconsistent with the treatment of the mature age allowance which is taxable. The bill ensures that, as from 1 July 1995, the mature age partner allowance will be taxable. Recipients of the allowance will generally be eligible for the pensioner rebate, which will offset the tax on the allowance subject to any other income received. The financial impact of this measure is a negligible gain to the revenue. The bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments of tax provisions related to social welfare matters which have no impact on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sales tax&mdash;new credit ground for unregistered exemption users</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing sales tax law, an assessable dealing is taxable unless an exemption applies. An exemption applies when a quotation is made or the goods in question are always exempt goods. The law requires that a quote for a dealing be made at or before the time of the dealing for it to be effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a person does not quote for a taxable dealing, then the dealing is taxable. A credit ground currently exists to enable a registered person to obtain a credit of tax paid on a dealing for which they had borne tax even though they were entitled to quote a registration number. The bill proposes to insert a similar credit ground to enable unregistered persons to obtain a credit of tax paid on a dealing for which they had borne tax even though they were entitled to quote an exemption declaration. The effect of this amendment on the revenue will be negligible. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sales tax&mdash;exemption for UHF transmitters</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a limited extension to the operation of an earlier exemption from sales tax for certain UHF transmitters for use in commercial television broadcasting to cover the period 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1995. The new exemption will apply to transmitters for use in connection with the equalisation program which aims to provide services in regional areas comparable to those in capital cities. The government considers that the extension is appropriate because the equalisation program is not yet completed in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, and it would be inequitable to deny licensees in those states the benefit of the incentive which had been available to eastern mainland licensees. The total cost to the revenue for the period of the exemption is likely to be about $2 million. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Minor amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments which have no impact on the revenue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) is an omnibus tax bill dealing with tax exemptions for state and territory bodies, employee share acquisition schemes, refunds of tax file number amounts deducted in error, pensions, allowances and benefits, superannuation measures, late lodgment penalties and sales tax. The most substantive changes in this bill are contained in schedule 2, which deals with the tax treatment of employee share acquisition schemes. This is the government's third attempt in 13 months to change the tax rules on employee share acquisition schemes. The approach taken by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and his office on this matter could only be described as bloody-minded and intransigent. It has been part of a continuing pattern to restrict and marginalise employee share acquisition schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commending the bill to the House, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in relation to these measures: `The nature of these measures is such that a reliable estimate of the revenue impact cannot be provided.' The government cannot say it is doing this to raise revenue or, if it is defeated, that it will cost revenue. The government says itself that it cannot give any estimate of the revenue impact. Probably closer to the truth is the fact that the government cannot estimate the revenue implications because this is not so much designed at revenue; it is designed to have the effect of restricting or wiping out employee share acquisition schemes. If that be its effect, there would be no revenue implications as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was clear to everybody that the Treasurer's plan to bring employee share ownership plans into the net of fringe benefits was atrocious and would effectively destroy the operation of all existing schemes, the Treasurer carried on regardless, not listening to anyone, steadfastly ignoring industry concerns, and seeking to push ahead with his plan, under cover and with all sorts of outlandish claims. The Treasurer and his office even ignored warnings and advice coming from their own department. In a particularly poor display, the Treasurer lashed out at his critics as supporters of tax avoidance. That has never been the case. If there is any rorting going on under the current system I make it clear, and those companies which support our stand on this matter make it clear, that it should be identified and such amendments undertaken as would prevent it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer was finally forced to concede at the end of March this year that his plan to impose fringe benefits tax on employee share acquisition schemes was ill-conceived and ill-considered. He was forced into a humiliating backdown. He had to admit that he was wrong, that the charges that he had levelled against his critics were wrong, that they were right, and that his charges had been nothing more than an attempt to cover up a major policy bungle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So has he got it right the third time with the proposals that have been brought back to this House for debate today? The answer is a resounding no. Wrong the first time, wrong the second time, wrong the third time. Three strikes and you are out. We the coalition will vote against that part of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government could have amended section 26AAC, taking out the flaws, but it has chosen to introduce a new regime with onerous features designed, one can only surmise, to make employee share acquisition schemes less attractive and less available to the Australian work force. The government's legislation threatens the viability of current schemes and  restricts the potential for further expansion of employee share ownership in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we had the quite amazing spectacle of the Treasurer asserting a massive conspiracy and growth industry of evasion in respect of employee share ownership plans. That, he said, was the rationale behind the FBT plan. But when it came to the cold hard facts the government has unable to produce any evidence to substantiate these charges. The Treasurer failed to identify the alleged problem which he was trying to counter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give this undertaking to the government: the coalition will support any amendments to current section 26AAC to prevent any rorting that can be identified; however, we will oppose the implementation of provisions covering employee share ownership plans as contained in this bill. We will vote against them. We call on Independents and fair-minded parties in the Senate not just to support us but to support those companies that have taken the step to distribute shares to employees and, even more importantly, to support those employees who have taken up shares in companies that they work for and that they want to invest in not only with their time and their labour but also with their financial security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that existing provisions in section 26AAC could be improved, but this legislation goes way beyond addressing any flaws. By acting to retain the existing law, the coalition will secure the existence of plans currently in force. In government we will iron out the flaws but we will iron them out in the context of expanding employee share ownership in this country&mdash;not in the niggardly way of the Treasurer of trying to restrict it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has merely replaced his FBT mess with an income tax disaster. There may be no FBT but the government seeks to impose a complex set of income tax rules. The bill seeks to replace one section in the Income Tax Assessment Act with 40 new sections. The coalition will once again stand up and defend employee share ownership schemes, which are under attack by this Labor government, and assist and encourage the hundreds of thousands of employees who want a stake in corporate Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The qualifying conditions for obtaining the tax discount under this proposal are far too tight. They mean that many plans would have to be substantially modified to take advantage of them. Overseas and international share plans cannot be quickly modified to meet Australian requirements when they are operating on an international basis. It is far more likely that they will be modified to exclude Australian employees rather than amended to include them and have an effect on employees in each and every other country in which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax treatment of share options is still a complete disaster. The taxing of options is inequitable and harsh. It taxes a potential gain that may never be realised. This is contrary to the general principle that income is taxable only on realisation. No allowance or concession is provided for employees participating in schemes operated by foreign parent companies, where options may be issued with a maximum exercise period of 10 years. Employees in Australia would be forced to pay tax either up-front or five years after acquisition. The five-year minimum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving employees with a tax liability to be met most probably by selling options in that case for the benefit of paying the tax accrued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer's flawed proposal will discourage employers, especially international companies, from offering employee share plans to their Australian employees. In a joint submission to the Treasurer the American Chamber of Commerce, the Business Council of Australia, the Corporate Tax Association, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of CPAs said, if this proposal were enacted in its current form, they expected many international companies would cease offering participation in their share plans to Australian employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation contains a very limited right to refund of tax paid on acquiring rights. It provides no entitlement to a refund of tax paid where the option lapses owing to a variety of circumstances, including the non-fulfilment of performance in length of service conditions or where the option is not exercised because the market value of the share has fallen below the option exercise price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The valuation rules contained in the legislation are complex and unrealistic. The valuation of options is yet another minefield contained in this legislation. It is quite unreasonable to ignore restrictions in conditions when valuing options. In government, the coalition will address such flaws as exist in the current scheme and introduce a new scheme designed not to discourage but to encourage wider employee share ownership. We will seek to promote and enhance the growth of employee share ownership plans and let them flourish right across the work force. These schemes have an important part to play in lifting workplace productivity and raising international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition wants employees to have the opportunity to take a stake in the businesses which employ them. We want to see as many employees as possible owning shares through employee share schemes. Through these schemes we can promote greater industrial harmony. This is one vehicle which can be used to break down the barriers between management and employees, to break down the division which has been created through a complex and legalistic industrial relations system. It is this Labor government which stands in the way of a new enterprise culture and consensus emerging within the Australian work force through the widespread promotion of employee share ownership schemes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters contained in this bill and I will traverse through them to indicate the position the coalition takes in relation to them. Schedule 1 of this bill amends the income and sales tax laws to exempt wholly owned state and territory bodies from income tax and sales tax, except for certain specified bodies in accordance with the agreement reached at the 1994 Premiers Conference for equivalent state regimes to be introduced. Many state and territory bodies covered by these amendments are already exempt and the aim of the amendments is to clarify the existing law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Municipal corporations and other local government bodies, public education institutions and public hospitals are to be excluded because they are not intended to be subject to tax equivalent regimes. State government insurance offices are also excluded and will continue to be taxed only on their life insurance and superannuation business. Other bodies may also be excluded by agreement between the states and the Commonwealth. The income tax exemption will apply from and including the 1994-95 year of income. The sales tax exemption will apply to dealings occurring on or after 1 July 1994. The coalition supports rationalisation of this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 of the bill will limit refunds by investment bodies of tax file number amounts which have been deducted in error to amounts deducted in the current financial year only. Claims for refunds will have to be made by 15 July in the financial year following the error. This proposal is intended to reduce costs incurred by investment bodies where amounts are incorrectly deducted. Where a claim is not made in time, the investor will be entitled to a credit on assessment for the amount incorrectly deducted. However, the tax commissioner will be able to give direct refunds in appropriate areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, investment bodies must deduct a prescribed amount, unless an investor has quoted a tax file number, and remit the amount to the commissioner. Where the body has deducted an amount in error and remitted it, the body must always refund the amount to the investor and recover the amount from the commissioner. Investors are currently not entitled to obtain a credit on assessment for the amounts. The coalition does not oppose these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 3 of the bill removes the income tax exemption for the mature partner allowance. Only the supplementary amounts are to be exempt. The allowance was inadvertently exempted from tax and it was the government's intention that the allowance be taxable. We recognise that intention and do not oppose the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also amend the capital gains provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act to allow certain superannuation funds which merge on or after 1 July 1994 and before 1 July 1997 to roll over any accrued capital gains and losses that would be realised on the assets transferred as a result of the merger. These amendments implement the decision announced last year by the Treasurer in his statement on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will allow the trustee of a transferor fund that merges on or after 1 July 1994 to roll over any capital gains or losses that would be realised as a result of a merger where: the merging funds are qualifying funds; the transferor fund is in existence on 1 July 1994; the disposal of the asset occurs under a merger between the transferor and transferee; the transferor and transferee elect that capital gains rollover relief will apply to all the assets transferred under the merger; and the transferor keeps the election and gives a copy to the transferee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's capital gains tax rollover relief for merging superannuation funds has been criticised for a number of reasons. To begin with, the government fails to extend relief to small super funds. The government's legislation specifically excludes super funds with fewer than five members. As a result, about 90 to 95 per cent of superannuation funds are excluded funds and are not eligible for rollover relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal also only applies when a merger takes place in a year. It is not always possible to plan and carry out a merger within the confines of a year. The proposal also prevents the transfer of realised capital losses from a fund closing down. This will penalise transferring members who will never be able to utilise capital losses quarantined in old superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will not offer small funds, which make up the majority of super funds, any tax relief for merging with larger funds. It is for this reason that the coalition will move amendments to extend the application of the capital gains tax rollover relief to funds with fewer than five members. The coalition also believes that the capital gains tax rollover relief should not be restricted to the three-year period announced by the government. For this reason, we will move to extend this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes amendments to the taxation arrangements for superannuation pensions and rollover annuities. The bill clarifies the start date of pensions and annuities. The deductible amount of a life time superannuation pension or annuity will be calculated based on life expectancy at the beginning of the period in respect of which the pension or annuity is payable. As the deductible amount is the undeducted purchase price of the pension or annuity divided by the term the pension is expected to be payable, the commencement date of pensions and annuities is vitally important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will ensure that the undeducted purchase price which applies to pensions and annuities purchased prior to 1 July 1994 will also apply to pensions and annuities wholly purchased with an eligible termination payment representing the commutation or residual capital value of a pension or annuity that commenced prior to 1 July 1994. The coalition supports this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also make changes to disability superannuation pensions. The amendments contained in this bill will ensure that taxpayers in receipt of a disability pension prior to 1 July 1994 will retain their entitlement to a rebate. The definition of death or disability annuity pension will be replaced by a new definition. The coalition does not oppose these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also restrict deductions for employer superannuation contributions to contributions made to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an eligible employee, whether or not the benefits are payable to a dependant of the employee in the event of the employee's death. This will ensure that a deduction is not available to an employer for contributions to a superannuation fund established directly for the benefit of a spouse or any other dependant of the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also ensure that a taxpayer who received an eligible termination payment between 1 April 1994 and 30 June 1994 will have 90 days, or such longer period as the Commissioner of Taxation allows, to roll over the eligible termination payment. This amendment has been made necessary because past amendments have resulted in superannuants who received an eligible termination payment between those dates being denied access to both the 90-day rollover and the facility to retain moneys while they decide how to invest their entitlement. This is one of the failings of the government's confused approach to superannuation. We support efforts to correct the government's failings in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also make various amendments to the operation of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. The bill will make it clear that the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the ambit of superannuation is unaffected by the enactment of the superannuation guarantee legislation. The bill will also ensure that the actual percentage level of superannuation support provided for an employee for flat dollar contributions is calculated on the actual contributions paid by the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also amend the super guarantee legislation to generally exempt the income which elected local government councillors derive in the conduct of their duties as councillors. The bill will insert new definitions of  employee and employer in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act to overcome unintended consequences resulting from the exclusion of councillors from the superannuation guarantee legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has strongly criticised the government for the application of the superannuation guarantee charge legislation to local government councillors. It has taken far too long for the government to act to rectify this situation. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended this change back in June 1992. In September 1993, Senator Ian Macdonald, a coalition senator from Queensland, introduced a private member's bill with the same objectives, which passed through the Senate. Of course, there has been benign neglect by the government in the House of Representatives until this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's amendment will apply only to assessments back to 1 July 1993, whereas the superannuation guarantee regime commenced on 1 July 1992. It is for this reason that we will move to amend these provisions to ensure they apply from 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also make a number of miscellaneous amendments in respect of superannuation. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be able to undertake statistical surveys. The bill will ensure that trustees or investment managers of an excluded fund will not be precluded from taking advantage of the exception to the rule in section 66(2) of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act prohibiting acquisition of a member's assets relating to `exempt business real property' simply because the member's business is established in company form and not as a sole trader or partnership. The bill will allow the financial backing requirements imposed on approved trustees and custodians to be met by having an approved guarantee and net tangible assets which together amount to at least the prescribed amount, which is currently $5 million. The coalition will not oppose any of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also introduce a new regime of penalties for late lodgment of income tax returns. Two different late lodgment penalty systems apply, depending on the category of the taxpayer. The coalition is concerned about the imposition of late lodgment penalties on relevant entities and instalment taxpayers, including super funds and companies, irrespective of the size of the tax liability. In other words, it does not matter whether they pay $1 million tax or have a tax loss. The bill does not seek to impose late lodgment penalties on individuals when no tax is payable. For this reason the coalition will move amendments which remove the application of late lodgment penalties on companies and superannuation funds where no tax is payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we will move an amendment which will defer the commencement of the late lodgment penalty scheme for instalment taxpayers and relevant entities to the 1995-96 income year. Companies and superannuation funds are just coming to grips with the new company tax payment regime which commenced for small and medium companies and superannuation funds this financial year. The new regime will commence for large companies next financial year. The government has now also hit companies with a higher company tax rate of 36 per cent, which is in breach of its election promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an uproar by accountants and tax agents concerning the lodgment return dates for small companies this year. We will give small companies a break by deferring the commencement of this extra penalty regime by our amendment to a time when the lodgment dates of returns in the new instalment regime should be settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the sales tax regime to extend the operation of an earlier exemption for certain UHF transmitters, which the coalition does not oppose. Finally, the bill also inserts a new credit ground so that unregistered persons can claim refunds of sales tax they have borne on an assessable dealing, even though they were entitled to quote an exemption declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals were originally put forward by Senator John Watson, a Liberal senator from Tasmania. He put these proposals forward in the Senate in the form of a private member's bill in order to pick up these anomalies. Again, the government sat on its hands. It has taken quite some time for it to come around and recognise the necessity of these proposals. I am not sure that these proposals are as good as those of Senator Watson, but we know that government ministers do not have the same attentiveness to the tax act as has Senator Watson. But this is a recognition of his proposals which were supported by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone through some of the areas in which the coalition will seek to improve this legislation, but let me make it clear: we will seek to stop misconceived legislation which has the effect of undermining savings and good industrial relations, which has the effect of making life difficult for employers and employees to share in productivity together, and which has the effect of restricting employee share schemes. We in the coalition draw the line. It is one of the great differences between us and the government. We will vote against those proposals in this bill. </PARA>

The bill sets out to amend seven acts, including the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Fringe Benefits Assessment Act 1986 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all 14 measures are dealt with by this bill. I intend to deal with only some of them. Most notably, I intend, as did my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), to focus on the proposals relating to employee share schemes. The tax treatment of employee share schemes was debated in this place last November while we were considering the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994. It was then that Labor first tried to strangle the operation of employee share acquisition schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor tried to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to impose FBT on employee share benefits which arise when an employee acquires shares or rights to shares for an amount less than the market value. The premise on which the government decided to impose FBT on employee share acquisition schemes, which are known as ESAS, was the same as is now being offered. The government claims there is a potential and a likelihood that ESAS will be abused by employees and employers as a means of providing increased remuneration by non-PAYE means. Its reasoning is that this would have the potential of corrupting the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the fears of the government seem to be without foundation. There is no evidence of widespread abuse of these schemes. The government has consistently failed to justify why changes are needed. Nor has the government quantified the extent of the alleged rorting and where it is occurring. We simply do not know. The big problem with Labor's heavy-handed approach now, as it was then, is that it will destroy ESAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year after the government tried to implement its changes, several companies froze their schemes. Some wound up existing schemes and others merely held off putting schemes in place. This bill is just another instalment which will continue to send out the wrong signals to companies and prospective employee shareholders. The measures in the bill tackle the government's illusory problem in a different way while trying to preserve the approach of the current law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with this measure the government has shown itself yet again to be overly heavy-handed. As the law now stands, section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act taxes benefits arising from shares or rights to acquire shares&mdash;which, for ease of speech in subsequent remarks, I will refer to as `rights'&mdash;under an employee share acquisition scheme. Shares or rights are acquired in a company under an ESAS if the shares or rights are a consequence of employment or services rendered by the taxpayer or a relative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shares or rights acquired may be in the employing company or another company. If the shares are subject to restrictions or conditions so that the right of the taxpayer to dispose of the shares is restricted or the employee can be divested of ownership, then the employee is automatically taxed on the discount in the year when the restrictions or conditions are lifted. But the taxpayer can elect to be taxed in the year that the shares or rights are acquired. If the shares are not subject to such conditions, the employee is taxed in the year that the shares or rights are acquired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rights are not normally taxed until they are sold or exercised but the taxpayer can, in these proposals, elect to be taxed when the rights are acquired. There is a limited exemption of up to $200 per year for discounts on shares or rights acquired by employees for which certain conditions must be met before the exemption can be applied. The bill replaces section 26AAC with a new division 13A which provides for the taxation of shares or rights provided to employees under ESAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the hands of the employee the shares or rights are subject to income tax. Income tax can, nevertheless, be deferred for up to five years in certain circumstances. There is no limit on how much tax can be deferred. Where the shares are not subject to tax when acquired, the point at which the shares will be subject to tax is when the employee sells the shares, when the employee ceases to be employed by the employer company or holding company, and five years after the time the shares were provided to the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An income tax exemption on qualifying ESAS shares or rights up to a value of $500 per employee per year will be available in the year of income in which the shares or rights are acquired, provided stringent requirements are met. An employee will only be eligible for the exemption if he or she makes an election to be taxed at the time of acquisition on all shares and rights acquired in that year. The effect of an election is that no further tax is payable under the division, and the shares or rights will then be subject to general provisions of the income tax legislation, including capital gains tax law. A employee cannot benefit from both the tax exemption and the tax deferral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, a tax deduction to the employer will only be available for the provision of ESAS shares or rights where a deduction is available under the general provisions of section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, or where the shares or rights are provided under the $500 concession arrangements. A employee is entitled to a refund of income tax already paid where the employee loses the rights without ever having the power to exercise them. The capital gains tax provisions will be amended to ensure that there is no double taxation and that the advantage gained by concessions for qualifying shares or rights will not be clawed back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed division 13A will apply to shares or rights acquired under employee share schemes after 6 p.m. on 28 March 1995&mdash;not 10 May 1994, which is when the original proposal was announced. However, under compulsory transitional rules the existing provisions of 26AAC will continue to apply to some share rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed scheme has some improvements over the current scheme. By way of example, it restricts employee share schemes to those where the shares are issued in the employer or holding company of the employer. It also lifts the non-taxable discount from $200 to $500 but it is subject to more onerous conditions. As well, it prevents the capital gains tax clawing back the non-taxable discount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flip side of the coin is that the proposed scheme has the following disadvantages compared with what currently applies: the proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefit is realised; the five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving employees with an unfunded tax liability; the qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are far too tight; there is no refund of the tax paid on options that lapse; the valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options; and most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed up front.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employee share acquisition schemes would be more successful in terms of the number of participants if they allowed a bigger discount; widened the qualifying conditions to allow access to the discount; allowed the issue of shares other than ordinary shares&mdash;not redeemable preference or partly paid, but perhaps shares with restricted or non-voting rights; provided the capacity to recover tax paid when options lapse; and allowed a deduction for loss incurred on disposal, although this may have to be subject to restrictions. Employee share acquisition schemes are very important for several reasons, including the fact that they give workers a stake in their workplace, provide a means of creating a fairer society and build the level of national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor and the coalition come at this issue from entirely different perspectives. ESAS schemes have long been encouraged by the coalition, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already pointed out, and have faced their stiffest resistance from sections of the Labor movement. This resistance has come from both the trade unions and the Labor Party. For the trade unions, it has traditionally been important to them to maintain the distinctions between capital and labour. It was not&mdash;and still is not, according to some&mdash;desirable for workers to gain shares in the company which employs them, because to do so would erode the unity of the labour movement in the face of the influence of capital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, you are one of the few on your side&mdash;particularly in your faction&mdash;who has not. ESAS is important to our longer term economic growth and increased levels of productivity. ESAS is also an industrial relations issue that helps draw workers and management together. In firms where workers are also shareholders in the firm, the workers have a greater work ethic which is related to their desire to see the firm in which they have a stake do well. It is in the interests of the workers to increase profitability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very notion of ESAS puts the fear of God into the hearts of some of Labor's mates in the trade unions. Many unions fear ESAS because employees who own shares lose their `them and us' mentality and, therefore, lose the desire to engage in petty and bloody-minded industrial action. This is possibly an unintended consequence of imposing the fringe benefits tax on ESAS&mdash;an unintended consequence which Labor is quite happy to live with and which will be lauded by its union mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does ESAS provide employees with an increased stake in the future of their company, but such schemes also give workers a greater stake in their community and in their society. A work force of small shareholders will do a great deal for improving the lot of this country. A nation of shareholders will make society less unequal and will improve the commitment of Australians to our democratic and capitalist system. Instead, we have a scenario under Labor where the rich are getting richer, mainstream Australians are deprived of opportunity and the poor are increasingly locked into a welfare induced poverty cycle in far too many cases. This does nothing but alienate an increasing number of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government which claims to be inclusive. It is actually a government which only pays lip-service to social justice. The reality is that it is a government which pursues exclusivist policies. If Labor wanted a society with a harmonious social structure it would be encouraging share ownership, not discouraging it with measures such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of increasing the level of national saving, Dr FitzGerald, in his report to the present government, estimated that ESAS could raise national savings by half of one per cent of gross domestic product, or around $2 billion in today's dollars, and increase annual tax revenues permanently by more than $500 million in today's dollars by the end of the decade. We all pay lip-service to increasing national saving, yet the government's approach is based solely on increasing the amount of money going into superannuation, when it could do much more to encourage further savings by inclusive policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This entire ESAS debacle is illustrative of a pedestrian Treasury, which cannot see the forest for the trees; or, more probably, it is Labor which restricts the Treasury from putting forward the best approach. After all, we all know the Treasury boffins were advocating widespread tax reform in the 1980s, including a broad based consumption tax. It is no wonder, I guess, that we have a ridiculously complex tax system, with compliance costs only lower than those in the USA, and continuous legislative changes to the tax laws which have made those very same laws unfathomable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces a new regime of penalties for late lodgment of income tax returns. Two different late lodgment penalty systems apply, depending on the category of taxpayer. For companies, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, pooled superannuation funds and some trusts, currently a flat penalty system applies. This is applied at the rate of $25 per week for the period that a return is late, with a maximum of $500. But it takes no account of the level of tax payable, in that, even if no tax is payable or a loss is incurred, the return nevertheless qualifies for a penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner of Taxation has the discretion to remit the late lodgment penalty, but there is no reason for anyone to feel comforted or rely on that. This bill amends those late payment penalties so that there will be a penalty tax at eight per cent per annum and penalty interest at the statutory rate&mdash;for the period January 1995 to June 1995&mdash;of 10.8 per cent, which will be calculated on a daily basis from the date tax becomes due and payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of penalties for late lodgment of returns when no tax is payable is seen by most observers as merely a revenue raiser. It should be dropped or, at the very least, deferred. Such measures do nothing to inspire confidence in the small business community. Companies with no tax bill which have not lodged returns or are late with those returns should not be penalised. It is for this reason that the coalition will be moving amendments to this measure. Small business does not need, nor can it afford, this extra impost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) does a number of things. I am sure that the shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), went into detail on most of them in his response. The bill amends a number of pieces of legislation, but my interest in this matter, and indeed the most controversial part of the bill before us, is the government's attempt to regulate employee share schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been pointed out, this is the government's latest attempt&mdash;I think the third attempt&mdash;to regulate employee share schemes. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution to this debate put it particularly well when he said that, although in a lot of respects this is a technical bill, it does get to the heart of the fundamental philosophical differences between this government and the opposition in our approaches to a whole range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about employee share schemes, we are focusing very strongly on relations between employers and employees. As the member for Curtin quite rightly pointed out, the fact is that the government is wedded, by virtue of its commitment to the trade union movement, to a system of industrial relations that is outmoded. The extent to which it will be able to facilitate or encourage employee share ownership will be limited by the unions' incapacity or unwillingness to allow the government to move too far down that track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our point of view, the vehicle of employee share ownership is integral, crucial, to our whole approach to industrial relations. We want to see and encourage employers and employees to work together at the enterprise level. One important element of allowing and facilitating that is by virtue of employee share ownership; hence our attitude on this side, as has been stated by the shadow Treasurer, is that we are opposed to what the government now proposes. We will be moving amendments to reflect the opposition's approach, which I believe, quite clearly, is a much more enlightened approach to this whole issue, as is our approach to industrial relations, of which this forms one small part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government clearly got it wrong the first time. It was caught out badly in its ham-fisted attempt to extend the fringe benefits tax to cover these arrangements. There were some elements of concern about the way the arrangements were being abused. They could have been fixed easily. Instead the government, buoyed by the success of its FBT&mdash;the fact is that FBT has grown and grown and, as a consequence, businesses have groaned and groaned under the impost of it&mdash;could not help itself and rushed into extending cover to these arrangements. These arrangements did not pass the Senate and were subsequently taken out of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But 10 months later, on 28 March 1995, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who unfortunately is not in the House this morning, issued a press release in which he finally admitted, after all that time and despite all the input the government must have had from small business about how ill advised its approach on the whole issue was, that the government had got it wrong. Backflips and unintended consequences have been a feature of this government over many years. It gets things wrong so often because it rushes into things, because it is pushed and because it is cornered philosophically so that, rather than do the right thing, it is forced to effectively do the less than optimal thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even yesterday we saw a major and welcome backflip in industrial relations, with the final acknowledgment, months and months down the track, by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) that the government got it absolutely wrong in respect of the unfair dismissal provisions. But you have to drag the government screaming to that point. It sometimes takes a very long time to wake up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before us a new proposal with respect to employee share ownership schemes which will enable employers to receive an unlimited value of ordinary shares or rights in their employer companies or on a deferred tax basis, providing certain conditions are met. Tax deferral has a five-year limit and tax exemptions will be allowed to a limit of $500 per annum. They will also be available on a conditional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest criticism we have of the new proposal is that, in the great majority of cases, recipients will have to sell their shares to raise money to pay the tax. I think the honourable member for Curtin also referred to that. The government has a problem with ordinary people owning shares. If that were not so, it would do something to overcome that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation is currently in place which prevents pensioners and self-funded retirees from owning shares. The taking into account of unrealised capital gains has effectively forced many retired people and pensioners to sell their shares. Of course, the government's proposal that  deeming provisions be introduced from July 1996 will not improve that situation at all. The fact is that it will be very difficult for people to own share portfolios. Certainly that will be the effect of this legislation. People who have shares in businesses will have to pay tax and many of them will have to sell their shares in order to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an obvious disincentive for businesses to enter into such an arrangement with their employees, who, once they become aware of the downside, may be unwilling to enter into these arrangements. It is difficult in the end to see how this new proposal is justified at all. It is quite clear that the bureaucrats who put all this together have failed to understand all the issues involved with employee share plans. They have taken a very limited and restricted view rather than consider the whole picture which, as we have already said, encompasses industrial relations and a range of other issues. They have taken a very narrow approach in the proposals they have presented to the parliament today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the current changes that represent a considerable improvement over the original proposal, Australia will still rank very poorly in the world in its treatment of employee share plans. I suspect that that reflects where we rank in the world in industrial relations systems. We are clearly pointing out here this morning that there is a very strong nexus between the two. By world standards, we have an outdated industrial relations system and we will be seen to be still treating employee share plans very poorly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still a real sense of uncertainty in the community, which is caused by the government's inept handling to date of this whole issue. A major flaw in the current provisions is the restricting of concessional treatment to ordinary shares and rights issued by employers to employees in their own companies. That has been clearly pointed out in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's new proposal effectively excludes all small unlisted companies and non-incorporated businesses from being able to pass on share plan tax benefits to their employees or to utilise new generation share plans for the same purpose. This is obviously a major limitation in the current legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employee share plans have major implications for national savings. They are a valid plank in the approach to improving our national savings performance. As has been said in this place very often, our savings performance has been very poor historically and remains at historically low levels, not only for Australia but also compared to other OECD countries. It is interesting to look at a table that shows household savings rates as a percentage of disposable household income. The figure for Australia in 1993 was five per cent and, for 1994, is 6.7 per cent. The projection for 1995 is 5.3 per cent and, for 1996, 4.4 per cent. So there is a downward trend of household savings as a percentage of disposable household income. We compare unfavourably with other OECD countries. The percentage for Japan is 15 per cent; Germany, 11.6 per cent; France, 12.6 per cent; Italy, 14.1 per cent; and so on. Very few countries are performing worse than Australia by that measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But perhaps a more important measure is gross national savings as a percentage of gross domestic product. That table is alarming and reveals the poor performance of Australia in this respect. The table that I have here shows the trend between 1977 and 1993. If we take the 1993 figures, the figure for Australian gross national savings as a percentage of GDP was 16.5 per cent. In 1992 it was 15.6 per cent. The interesting thing about this table is that it shows us being about the same level as Mexico. Mexico is way down the bottom. If you take the 1992 figures, the total OECD average is 19.4 per cent. In that year Australia's performance was 15.6 per cent. Mexico's was about the same, at 16.1 per cent&mdash;way below the OECD average. Very few countries are performing worse than Australia and Mexico. They are right at the bottom in terms of OECD performance in this table. It is quite concerning that Australia and Mexico seem to be comparable on so many scores. We heard yesterday, much to the chagrin of the government, that our balance of payments deficit level is once again at the bottom of the list, on a par with Mexico. </PARA>

The Minister for Finance tried to wiggle his way out of it by saying that on other measures we do not compare directly with Mexico. But we do compare directly with Mexico. I do not want to cast too many aspersions on the Mexicans, but the Mexican economy is a basket case. Mexico had to race off to the United States only a few months ago and ask for what amounted to a handout of billions of dollars to stop the country from going completely under. It is an odious comparison to make to compare the Australian economy with Mexico's but it is a valid comparison on a number of measures.

They are a vehicle to improve national savings and ought to be encouraged and facilitated. Yet to date the government has attempted, and is doing nothing different with this legislation, to effectively discourage employee share ownership purely because it has some philosophical problem because of the strictures placed upon it by its union masters in respect of embracing wholeheartedly by world standards an enlightened approach to employee share ownership and the implications that approach has for improving industrial relations in this country. Even if in the end it has a detrimental effect on the unions that should not be the motivation, but it is the motivation of this government to look after its union mates. Hence its philosophical opposition to these sorts of approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why these plans are important. Opposition speakers have said&mdash;this has not yet been contradicted by the government&mdash;that this is the reason why we support the plans. We support them, but we find the government is effectively discouraging them because of the impact they have on national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A coalition government, as the shadow Treasurer said, would be committed to encouraging these programs. We understand they have positive implications for industrial relations. It is important that we undertake a major review of them with a view to making sure they are facilitated. I am sure the government is attempting in part to overcome their downside in terms of possible rorts, but they can be overcome without throwing the baby out with the bathwater. That is effectively what the government has done with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There clearly needs to be a further report along the lines of the FitzGerald report which looks further at the whole issue of private savings. As I pointed out, the need to increase savings is evident but the mechanisms for doing so are not so clear. Employee share plans are one. Perhaps looking at tax concessions for interest on savings accounts would be another enlightened way of encouraging savings. In this country we need to encourage savings. We have not done that up to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposes many aspects of this government's approach. We oppose the fact that the proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefit is realised. We are opposed to the fact that the five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before employees acquire shares, leaving employees with an unfunded tax liability. We are concerned that the qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are too tight and that no refund of tax will be paid on options that lapse.

I apologise to the House that, because of my duties in the Main Committee, I did not hear the earlier debate. I am indebted to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table, for giving me what I believe to be a very fair and concise overview of the direction of the debate so far. Having listened to about 10 to 15 minutes of the speech made by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), I think I have the drift of it. I have been baited a little by what he said and will address some of his remarks towards the end of my comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 is a fairly wide ranging tax amendment piece of legislation. It goes to a wide variety of matters. There should not be any great concern that from time to time bills such as this come before the House. Without going to the matter that is involved, I want to illustrate one aspect. What we are talking about in the part of the legislation dealing with sales tax exemption on UHF transmitters is that we have had in place a policy for equalisation but have found that certain things were not able to be achieved in the time frame that was first envisaged. Therefore, we are extending the exemption. This is an illustration of how from time to time different aspects of our tax law have to be amended because we want to ensure that consequences we expected from the changes are achievable. Sometimes time frames are paramount in what needs to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one aspect of this piece of legislation that really caught my attention, and led to my being so bold as to put my name on the speakers list, was that dealing with superannuation guarantee and local government councillors. There was quite a campaign about the way in which the superannuation guarantee levy impinged upon elected councillors, impinged upon the allowances that elected councillors received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of the case was put to me by the local government in the city of Whittlesea, amongst other municipalities that came to me and sought my assistance. That aspect was that we managed to have the peculiar situation where there were apparently two definitions of `employee'&mdash;one for the purposes of income tax and one for the purposes of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not often do this but I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) about these matters, and he quite rightly took advice from the Australian Taxation Office. In replying to my office, he provided copies of determinations by the commissioner. I have to say that, in respect of the reply he sent to me in August 1993, I noted on my file copy `the logic escapes me'. It was even worse when we had a second go at it. We got a reply back in January 1994 and a member of my staff described the Assistant Treasurer's letter as a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we should not be so emotive about different aspects, and I am pleased to see that this legislation addresses some of the perceived problems. I think that is fair because the nature of the allowances received by local councillors previously, especially in the state of Victoria, was that they were in lieu of a reimbursement of expenses. They were hardly a salary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those allowances were first put in place they were set at the level of $1,200, and that may have reached the level of either $2,000 or $3,000 by the time elected councillors were dismissed by the Victorian government and replaced by commissioners. It was really something that was basically a voluntary effort by those elected to those municipalities. I am pleased that the result of the amendments we see in this piece of legislation acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not stray too far from the bill but I just want to make some comments. In Victoria, with the changes we are seeing in local government, there is under consideration a different role for elected councillors when we see a return to democratically elected councillors in March 1997. There is some contemplation that they will better represent part-time or full-time positions where the remuneration can be seen as a form of salary. I accept that, if that is the eventuation, salary will come within the ambit of all our tax laws, the income tax superannuation guarantee and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That move really does highlight the fact that local government in Victoria is going through a great transition. Unfortunately, that transition has led to commissioners being appointed for a period of nearly two years. That is a disappointment. I do not wish to reflect upon individual commissioners but, at the end of the day, they have been appointed by the state government and have been asked to achieve an agenda that the state government has put in place for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be interesting to see whether the role of a local councillor is given a greater status. If during this period the state government is realistic in defining a wider role for local councillors, perhaps that will make the full-time positions more attractive to people and that would lead to those elected people getting a remuneration that more reflects a salary rather than a reimbursement of expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make brief mention of the aspect of this legislation that appears to have got the opposition well and truly in a lather: employee share schemes. Unless I have completely and utterly missed the point, I think this really is setting out to achieve a number of those things the honourable member for McPherson tried to say it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there has been the notion that the measures in place in this legislation are as a result of some capital `I' ideological bent of the government. I do not know that I really agree with that. I often have to reconcile in my own mind that this Labor government is a government of the modern Labor Party. It is the government of a Labor Party that is evolving. Whilst it might give me concern from time to time that that has meant there have been shifts in the ideological basis of a number of things the government does&mdash;the clearest example of that is the government's attitude in certain areas to public ownership&mdash;we do see that still it is a government that has many of the fine traditions of previous Labor governments, still it attempts to look at those issues of equity and fairness, and still it looks to the way it can try to achieve things that can be seen as being for the wider common good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of his contribution, the honourable member for McPherson at least admitted that, in part, what we were trying to do with this amendment as it deals with employee share schemes was&mdash;to use his words&mdash;`to put a lid on any rorts that are going on'. Having come to a realisation that that is the intent, I find it a bit sad that, to my understanding, amendments proposed to be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) in the consideration in detail stage are to completely delete schedule 2, which deals with all those matters to do with employee share schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the drift of much of the case put by the coalition is that in some way this exemplifies some erroneous attitude that the government has to industrial relations. I would have thought that if we really read the intent of not only this amendment but also the basic legislation being amended, we would see that it gives scope for employees to take the option of investing in shares within the companies they are employed in. It is therefore a form by which workers can participate in their companies. It tightens the way in which any tax concession would be given. It gives options for the way in which the employee might decide to have the tax considerations of any discount he or she was to get on the share offer. That appears to be very fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, I think it goes to the issue the honourable member for McPherson highlighted: national savings. I do not think we have to have the great argument, this argy-bargy, about the situation at the moment. We need to have the argument about how we are going to best address it. The FitzGerald inquiry clearly showed that we, as a nation, need to address the level of our national savings. Much of this year's budget provisions went to addressing that. The whole intent of what we are trying to achieve in the area of superannuation has as an underpinning tenet that it is a measure to improve our national savings position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation measures will have a twofold outcome. These measures will not only attempt to give individuals the opportunity to put in place arrangements that will best suit them in their retirement but also attempt to, through these collective efforts, achieve a pool of national savings that we as a nation need. I think that this is most important and it is something that this government has had high on its agenda for quite some time. It is something that this government recognises needs to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at this Labor government's history on superannuation, we find that a national superannuation plan has always been high on its agenda. It is something that has often been under active consideration. The situation prior to the Second World War was that superannuation was basically restricted to white-collar workers. The situation improved only marginally in the postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Prime Minister Menzies&mdash;someone I know the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has a high regard for&mdash;promised a national superannuation scheme in 1949, but for various reasons did not deliver. Figures from the Bureau of Statistics show that at the time of the Whitlam government in 1974 only 29 per cent of the employed population belonged to super schemes. On three occasions&mdash;notably, September 1970, April 1971 and September 1971&mdash;the Labor Party was defeated in the parliament on motions calling for the establishment of a national superannuation scheme. Consequently, in the 1972 budget then Treasurer Snedden announced such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, former Prime Minister Whitlam said that it took 23 years and much cajoling from the ALP for the government to honour its commitment. In March 1973, the Whitlam government established a national superannuation committee of inquiry, the Hancock committee. The task of ensuring that Australian workers have access to superannuation has taken a long time. After the experiences of some two decades, we now see that by using different mechanisms&mdash;mechanisms that were not envisaged at that time&mdash;we have gone a long way to achieving a commitment towards a broad superannuation scheme that is accessible to all workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If members of the coalition want to highlight in this debate the issue of industrial relations then they should realise and acknowledge that the organised union movement has played its role in getting to this point. Representatives of the union movement have sat down and talked to the government&mdash;and they have not agreed entirely with the direction the government has taken on all occasions, but they have been at the table&mdash;and they have been willing to make concessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the workers they represent, they see the merits in not only the employer contributions but also the employee contributions. They recognise that to forgo, at this time, salary in lieu of making these superannuation contributions will benefit individual workers&mdash;if we are to look at their whole life, which is important. It is true that that money is not in their pockets now and that will have a consequence for them, but it has to be seen in light of the fact that this will have a benefit down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If employees choose to forgo part of their salary in order to make superannuation contributions, it will have a benefit for those workers as individuals and it will also have a benefit for the nation. Down the track more individuals will have their own form of income support in their retirement and will not have to rely on safety net provisions or social security payments and other types of welfare payments that the federal government has historically had to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to keep the system that we have seen over the past few decades, it would place an almighty burden on taxpayers as we go into the next century. The taxpayers would not be able to sustain the level of income that people enjoy at present. That is an important outcome of our move to this wider access to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another benefit of the movement that we see in this area is that it will increasingly give a savings pool of significant proportions. One of the great challenges for future governments will be to ensure that there is proper prudential management of those pools of money so that benefits can be accrued by individuals. The other benefit will be that, in the investment of those funds, those managers will be acting in the best interests of the whole Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge those involved in that management to give consideration to being able to place investments in things that will have that wider good. They should look at the different types of mechanisms that have been put in place as it will encourage them to invest in infrastructure. As I have often said in this place, if we do not ensure that we have proper investment in the infrastructure and the maintenance of infrastructure, it will lead to almighty problems that are being illustrated in other parts of the world such as the United States and some European countries. In conclusion, I have great pleasure in supporting this piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) talked about rorts. This legislation of the government is supposed to eliminate rorts. What rorts? This issue has been debated three times now in this parliament, and not once has the government been able to come up with chapter and verse of the rorts that this legislation is supposed to eliminate. What we in the opposition believe is that workers and managers should be partners in enterprises. They need to be friends, not enemies. This is why we are insistent that everything possible should be done to maximise the spread of employee share ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says it is in favour of employee share ownership, but its actions speak louder than its words. Under the tax regime that operated until last year, if an employee obtained shares at a concessional rate, then instead of paying tax on the value of that concession that tax could be deferred until the value of that share was realised. As I said, three times this government has tried to change the tax regime governing the issue of shares to employees. Twice it has been defeated. Three times it has got it wrong. This proposal will similarly be defeated&mdash;if not here, in another place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of the government's ham-fisted approach to employee share ownership is that 90 per cent of the employee share schemes currently operating in Australia are on indefinite hold. Of companies employing more than 1,000 people in Australia, 60 per cent at present have employee share schemes. These share schemes are on hold. In other words, companies employing 10 per cent of the work force have these schemes on hold. That is to say, one million Australian workers, who should have the benefit of employee share schemes, are being deprived of the benefit of these schemes because of this government's ham-fisted handling of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These companies are the household names of Australian industry. These companies are a rollcall of blue chips. These companies with employee share ownership schemes are not trying to rort the system; they are not trying to rip off the Australian people. These companies are trying to build a decent economy and a decent society. They include: AWA; Advance Bank; Amcor; Apple Computer; the Australian Industry Development Corporation, which in fact is owned by the federal government; the Bank of Melbourne; Baulderstone Hornibrook; Boral; Brambles; Burns Philp; Cadbury Schweppes; Clyde Industries; Coca-Cola; Commercial Union Assurance; the Commonwealth Bank of Australia; Country Road; CRA; Fletcher Jones; Gillette; Goodman Fielder; Hills Industries; James Hardie; Jennings Industries; Kraft Foods; Leighton Holdings; Lend Lease Corporation; National Australia Bank; Newcrest Mining; Normandy Poseidon; North Broken Hill Peko; Pacific Dunlop; Pasminco; South Australian Brewing; St George Building Society, now St George Bank; the Australian Gas Light Co.; BHP; Tubemakers; W.C.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are companies which this legislation implicitly accuses of cheating and defrauding the taxpayer. Quite frankly, these are not companies that would ever do that kind of thing; these are companies which have employee share ownership schemes in place because they want to do the right thing by their workers and by society. Qantas plans to issue each one of its 27,000 employees $500 worth of shares in the company. That exercise in democratic capitalism, that exercise in extending the benefits of government policy to workers, is on hold because of this foolish piece of ham-fisted legislative bungling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the previous position was that the concessions on shares issued to employees only attracted tax when those shares were realised. Under the latest government scheme you can do it two ways: if you elect to pay the tax up front, then you can get a tax concession of $500 on the shares issued. To just consider for a moment how trivial and how petty this concession is, $500 worth of BHP shares is probably about 50 shares. That is the trivial nature of the concession that this government is offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative is to take the shares and then pay tax in five years time. Let us consider this: an average worker is offered shares in his company by management. He thinks to himself, `Interest rates have just gone up three times in the last year. My mortgage is costing me more and more to carry each month, as the government's recovery peters out, as the economy hits the wall. My job is not as safe as it was.' That sort of worker is not going to be able to accept shares on a five-year deferred tax basis. If that worker does accept shares on that basis, what will happen is that he or she will take the shares, hold them for five years and then have to pay tax before having had a chance to enjoy their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme of the government is not a share owning scheme; it is actually a share renting scheme. By saying that workers can take the shares but that then they will have to pay the tax in five years time, the government is not turning workers into share owners; it is turning them into share renters. If a benefit is worth giving, it is worth giving for keeps. This is the shareholding equivalent of saying to people who currently get concession travel on the railways, `Okay, we'll let you buy your ticket for half price now, but at the end of the year for all those tickets that you've bought for half price you'll have to pay the rest of the full fare.' It just does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is attempting to apply to shareholders the same sort of logic as it has previously applied with the deeming principle to part pensioners. It is really saying, `You will have to pay tax on benefits that you haven't actually received.' Just as the government has said to pensioners, `Okay, we're cutting your pension and you can toddle off to Telecom and pay your phone bill with a BHP share,' it is really saying to workers who would like to own shares in their companies, `You've got to pay in tax good cash before you actually have the cash in your pocket to meet that tax bill.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other problems with this bill. I mention just two of them. The only people who will qualify even for these limited concessions that the government is offering are people who are taking ordinary shares. What that does is exclude from the operation of this kind of scheme companies which do not issue ordinary shares&mdash;that is to say, all those unlisted and private companies which employ something like two-thirds of the people in the Australian work force. In other words, this scheme of the government cuts out from the benefits of employee share ownership something like two-thirds of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, these small family run companies can go through all the legal and accounting trouble of establishing a class of ordinary shares so that they can cut their workers into the action and benefits of ownership. But the problem then is, unless those shares are traded regularly, unless there is a regular market in these shares, every time companies issue a share to a worker they will have to call in an auditor to get a valuation. Mr Deputy Speaker, how many companies will do that? The simple truth is: very few. What this legislation is doing is restricting the scope of employee share ownership. It is tying up in endless bureaucratic and accounting red tape the ability of companies to help their workers and help themselves at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consider the case of employee buy-outs. We all know that sometimes companies go bad&mdash;not because the workers are incapable but because the managers are incapable. In lots of instances the workers have tried to preserve their jobs and to keep those companies going by buying them out&mdash;by saying, `Look, management, you haven't done much of a job; let us see how we can go.' Under this legislation, if those companies then issue the shares back to the workers, the workers will have to pay tax on those shares in five years time and the worker buy-out will last only five years. Just as soon as the worker-owners of those companies start to get used to being men and women of substance, they will go back to being wage slaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone in this place agrees that Australia needs to lift national savings. Lifting national savings is important to get interest rates down, to get debt down and, in the long run, to be able to increase the wealth of our society so that real wages&mdash;which today are five per cent less than they were in 1976&mdash;can start to go up again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this piece of government legislation is that it will actually reduce the ability and incentives for Australians to save. At the moment, employee share schemes&mdash;schemes which are currently frozen in practice because of this legislation&mdash;have an estimated value of $3 billion. Vince FitzGerald, a very respected economist, has estimated that the government would get $500 million more in tax revenue every year under the regime that used to apply to these sorts of schemes than it has under any of the three schemes that the government has tried in the last 12 months. This legislation is an example of the government's propensity to tax first and think later because, if it had thought the legislation through, it would understand that it was actually going to make everybody worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a few exceptions that are not of great account and with the exception of a few members of the Victorian socialist Left, everyone in this parliament believes that the free market is the best method humankind has yet devised to generate wealth. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the market principle. The only problem is that the operation of the free market leaves some people with unequal market power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution is not to close down the market and thereby abolish people's freedom to buy and sell. The solution is to even up the market power of the citizens who are participating in the market. Employee share ownership is a way of turning workers into participants in the market, rather than leaving them slaves in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, as the member for Scullin pointed out, has come a long way. Unfortunately, in coming a long way, it has forgotten some of the enduring values that all members in this House should hold dear.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government were thinking of Ben Chifley and his memory and example, it would not be proceeding down this path. It would be encouraging employee share ownership schemes, not talking out of both sides of its mouth. On the one hand, it is saying, `Yes, we believe in these things,' and, on the other hand, it is introducing legislation which makes it practically impossible for these schemes to flourish and which has frozen 90 per cent of the schemes that are in existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this legislation, the government is saying, `It is okay for the Prime Minister to make a fortune and have his entrepreneurial investments, but we will not give the workers any chance to get a look-in.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the House is the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995. The coalition is strongly of the view that the proposals put forward by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in relation to employee share ownership schemes are fundamentally flawed, and this is the subject I want to discuss in the House today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of employee share ownership in terms of taxation support in this country goes back about 17 years. I think it is fair to say that, when the concept was initially developed, it had bipartisan support. Both government and opposition accepted the clear advantages which were to be found in having a mechanism by which people would be encouraged to make contributions through their income&mdash;normally by salary sacrifice type techniques&mdash;towards investing in the company which was employing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantages underlying the concept of worker participation through share ownership can best be described as follows: they reward good performance and the attainment of specific business objectives; they give the recipients a positive incentive to increase their company's productivity and profitability; they increase industrial harmony; they help to create a greater awareness of the company's operations; they encourage greater employee identification with shareholder interests and with the company's interests; they assist in remunerating staff properly and in line with overall market conditions; they can keep the fixed component of wage costs at a lower level than would otherwise be the case; they are a motivational tool which is good for morale; they can inspire greater loyalty to the company; they can provide another form of saving for retirement and they can do so without restrictions applying to conventional superannuation; they are tax effective; and they can help to attract and retain key staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This mechanism was developed initially in the United States which is regarded, somewhat euphemistically, as the home of capitalism. What we have seen in recent times&mdash;on three occasions in fact&mdash;are attempts by this Labor government to tinker with the system, not to improve it, not to make worker participation schemes through share ownership more attractive; but to fiddle around the edges, with the effect that we are firmly of the view that it will make this proposition less attractive than has been the case in the past. Putting it quite simply: the proposals put forward in this legislation are fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer's amendments will question and threaten the viability of current schemes and restrict the potential for the future expansion of employee share ownership in Australia. That is something which the opposition regards as fundamentally important in regard to not only the role it should be able to play in the overall need to increase national savings but also participation&mdash;that is the most important word of all&mdash;shared ownership, involvement or the ability of the workers of Australia, regardless of whether they are executives, white-collar workers or workers on the floor of the factory, to feel that the success of the enterprise to which they make such a real contribution can be reflected not just in their salaries and wages but also in their being part owners of the enterprise to which they have made such a major commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the third attempt in the last 13 months by the government to deal with this issue. We regard it as a third failure. The essence of the problem seems to be that the government believes that there are new schemes in place which are rorting the system, which are an effective means of tax avoidance and which therefore should be closed off. These schemes have been referred to within the taxation and accounting industry as `new age' schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition will be the first to agree that, if there is evidence that people are using these mechanisms to avoid taxation in an illegal sense, they should then be stopped. For example, if there is a means by which people can nominally buy shares in a company or in a trust fund which, in effect, can then be used to buy them overseas trips, to buy them boats, to buy them smart sports cars or even to buy them homes or real estate, one could legitimately say that was a gross misuse of the principles underlined in the original legislation which allowed these schemes in the first place. Of course, we would oppose such propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been made clear in this whole debate is the inability of the government to specifically identify these problems and then go about changing the law in an effective way to stop them. Instead of that, it is effectively changing the system in a way that will radically transform the whole basis upon which decisions are made by companies&mdash;often outside Australia&mdash;as to whether or not they are willing to continue to provide worker share ownership schemes to the benefit of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the government needs to encourage the distribution of shares right across the work force. We want employees to have the opportunity to have a stake in the businesses which employ them. That is really the basic difference between where we stand on this issue and where the current Labor government stands. We want as many employees as possible to own shares through employee share schemes. Clearly, the Labor Party wants to discourage them from owning shares by introducing new and extremely unfavourable tax treatment. We believe that Australia must encourage and increase employee share ownership to address our critically low level of national savings, as well as being a mechanism for encouraging a further lift in productivity and improved harmony within the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of worker participation schemes in Australia still remains far too low. Although the level of private share ownership has increased in recent years and is still increasing, it is still well below that of both the United States and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Treasurer has attempted to justify his proposals, he has failed over the last 13 months to quantify the extent of the tax minimisation or tax cheating problem which he claims is the basis of these changes. While he continues to do that, he cannot be surprised that the professional organisations, the employer organisations and the opposition will continue to be sceptical about his propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many aspects of the proposal which we find unacceptable. The proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefits are realised. The five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee even acquires a share. This leaves employees with an unfunded tax liability well into the future. The qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are far too tight. There is no refund of tax paid on options that may lapse. The valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options. Most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed up-front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is simply that today Australia is a derivative economy. Today the vast majority of the work force involved in major companies are employed by international corporations which have in place overseas worker participation schemes which they want to make available to their employees in this country. Surely, that is in their interests. It is a mechanism by which we can ensure that, while companies may be foreign owned, at least Australians working for them will have the capacity to make a contribution and to gain dividends&mdash;from their labour and the result of the success of that company internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition wants to see a situation where employees take a stake in the businesses where they work, where employees have a stake in the productivity of the business where they work and where, ultimately, they can see a share in the profits coming to them and to their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that as a nation we have one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world, some 74 per cent. It is equally very clear, as I have already stated, that Australians' share of capital ownership, particularly on an individual basis, is well below where it should be in relation to other countries. Therefore, this is one of the major problems which have to be addressed if we are to have a nation which is less dependent on foreign capital; a nation where the employees can feel that they are part owners of the corporations and the companies they work for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One proposal put forward by the government is a $500 discount for employees taking shares. The facts are that most people will not even qualify for those shares because they have to take the shares in the year in which they were issued; they cannot see them as an advance which can be utilised later when they have the funds to pay for them; shares should have no conditions for forfeiture; you cannot dispose of them before five years of employment; and the discount is restricted to people who have been employed for 24 months, rather than 12 months as previously. There should be discounts for employees taking shares. They should be open to all employees and they should have the option of holding on to those shares and getting the discount at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second fundamental flaw in the government's approach is the proposal that taxation liability on shares or options at the end of five years will arise whether or not those options are exercised or you have those shares. That is patently absurd. If you have not exercised those options, you may find yourself having to pay a tax liability for something that you never take up. There is no prospect for a refund in the eventuality that you do not take them up or that the options have lapsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also fundamentally flawed in this proposal is that many international companies which operate worldwide, as I have said, have employees around the world involved in share ownership plans and most of those international plans allow a 10-year period before any tax liability falls due on the options. But that is not what has been offered. This legislation is limited to a five-year period. That means that Australian law, by changing the goalposts at this stage, is effectively cutting out of the action thousands of Australian employees who otherwise would have access to the international worker participation and share ownership plans of their foreign employers. There is simply no logic whatsoever in applying such a law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any adverse effect upon employees of international companies posted in Australia will obviously arise out of the proposed legislation. The reason is that the legislation directly negates and inhibits the government's important and commendable objective, which I thought we always had, and certainly this government has made much noise about in recent times, that we want to attract to Australia international regional headquarters for operations in the Asia and Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The class of employee of an international corporation, through international practice for many years, has involved these various forms of employee share acquisition schemes. If an officer on being posted to a headquarters in Australia is going to be directly discriminated against, clearly it will be a fundamental factor in determining whether or not the headquarters will be transferred to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the removal of the FBT impost appearing in previous proposals&mdash;that is, the last three proposals of the government&mdash;nevertheless, the current proposals are clearly inadequate, mainly in the following areas: the conditions for qualification are too stringent and do not recognise a wide variety of employment practices and conditions; the five-year rule is too short and should be based on the period permitted under the law of the country of issue of the shares or rights, with a maximum period of, say, 10 years; the lack of an adjustment or refund where an option lapses or is unexercised is inequitable; and the valuation rules are clearly unrealistic, because employee options are usually non-transferable and non-tradeable. Those factors have been totally ignored in the development of this particular concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would therefore appear that while most, if not all, of the concerns the government has announced in the context of the so-called new age schemes, and the clones which can develop from them, need to be resolved&mdash;and the opposition has made it very clear that it would consider any sensible proposals in that regard&mdash;it is perfectly obvious that what has been happening in this particular set of amendments will make the situation for many people who are within the law, and many companies which have been doing the right thing by their employees and applying principles and practices on an international basis, will be effectively cut out of the action in terms of the Australian circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making the point that we in the opposition believe the worker participation schemes are important. They  can be a mixed blessing if they are not properly designed. But the practice of the last 17 years or so demonstrates that it can only be to the benefit of Australia and Australian employees and employers to have in place a rational, sensible scheme of proposals which lock in international practice on the one hand and domestic practice on the other. With regard to employee schemes, whether you are the employee of an international corporation or whether you are the employee of a national corporation in Australia, the rules must remain consistent in both cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, after 17 years of practice, after three attempts to change the rules in recent times, the government has still, regrettably, failed to make it worth while. The point needs to be made that Vince FitzGerald, in his eminent report of last year on national savings, made the point that there is a potential to increase revenue by some $500 million a year under the old scheme, provided it is administered effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see no advantage whatsoever to Australia, or to the employees who have previously been covered by these schemes, for the government to now change the goalposts at a time when it is quite clear that the proposals it is putting forward are not going to achieve the ends it wishes, but will simply reduce revenue, reduce the capacity of companies to want to offer these schemes and share participation arrangements. Consequently, this will directly result in a diminution in the quantum of Australian ownership of foreign shares of companies that operate in this country and will do absolutely nothing to increase Australia's capacity to be more independent in terms of capital raising, both here and overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not expect the member for O'Connor to understand. Of course you are opposing it. That is all you ever do&mdash;but no policies. That is your policy exactly. The policy of members of the opposition is to oppose&mdash;in the words of the member for O'Connor&mdash;but not to put forward any positive proposals. They are not doing it today. Today they have put up some amendments which, in effect, would just maintain the status quo. We know that the status quo is highly tilted towards executives getting the benefits of the employee share acquisition schemes provisions. The government wants to make sure that all employees get the benefits of these schemes. That is why we have brought the amendments to the legislation in. It is well recognised throughout the industry that the existing legislation is being abused. If we accept the amendments of the opposition, that will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition say, `Trust us. Once we get into government'&mdash;and that is some way off&mdash;`we will do something about it.' In the meantime they are happy to see this abuse carry on. We know that in a lot of public companies the main benefits of this scheme are going to the executives. I rule out the companies like the BHPs: they do have schemes in place in which all employees can participate. It is not as if the government has not listened to some of the criticisms that are around the place. We made some changes to the provisions when they were here last year. We have made sure that FBT does not apply and that the tax will be paid by the individual but that the tax can be deferred for five years. Currently there is no requirement for the benefits to go to all employees, and mainly the executives get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard a couple of the opposition speakers talk as though the opposition stands for all employees getting the benefits of these shares. The practical effect of its amendments is exactly the opposite, and the opposition knows it from experience. It is not as though we are talking academically here. We know what is happening in the marketplace now. We are saying that these benefits should go to all employees. We have made sure that that happens. To accommodate some of the concerns there will be a five-year tax deferral. There is no limit on the amount, but it will be taxed after five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again we are seeing the opposition opposing for the sake of opposing, with no constructive policies. It is a bit like the mystery flights that we hear about. In Perth now it is very fashionable to buy mystery airline tickets. When you go out to the airport you do not know whether you are going to Kalgoorlie or Sydney or Melbourne or anywhere. You turn up at the airport with your ticket and you could end up in any of those places. It is bit like that with opposition members. They are offering a ticket. You do not know where they are going. They do not know where they are going. It is apparent that they do not know where they are going because all they are doing is opposing. As the honourable member for O'Connor is honest enough to admit, it is their policy to oppose, but not to put up constructive alternatives. The amendments I will be moving will make sure that all employees of a company get access to the benefit of the employee share acquisition scheme, which is something the opposition talks about but, as practice shows, fails to deliver on. </PARA>

<PARA>The government's amendments deal with state and territory bodies contained in schedules 1 and 9 of this bill and the employee share acquisition scheme provisions contained in schedule 2 of the bill. I present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the amendments to item 1, amendment 1 inserts new section 24AYA. This section will disallow superannuation contributions of certain privatised STBs to the extent that those contributions are in respect of unfunded liabilities that accrue during the period from 1 July 1995 until the STB is privatised. Amendment 1 is part of a revenue safeguarding package. The package consists of restrictions on the use of losses and certain deductions of state and territory bodies, STBs, which are remaining in the Commonwealth tax net because they will soon be privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The item is also being amended to insert a definition of `prescribed excluded STB' into proposed new section 24AZ. The definition is necessary because the revenue safeguarding provisions all use the term. It is convenient, therefore, to have one definition rather than define the term in three separate provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendments to item 5. Amendment 4 removes the definition of `prescribed excluded STB' from section 51AD. The definition is being centralised into proposed new section 24AZ by amendment 2. Amendment 3 also amends the item to ensure cross-reference of the term `STB' back to division 1AB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 5 inserts new item 6A. This is a consequential amendment which ensures that paragraph 73C(2)(b) continues to have its intended effect following the introduction of a new exemption provision&mdash;that is, 24AM. Paragraph 73C(2)(b) reduces a deduction for research and development expenditure where the taxpayer receives or becomes entitled to receive a recoupment of or grant in respect of the expenditure from a government or a government authority. The amendment will include STBs as sources of such a recoupment or grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 6 inserts new item 9A. It expands the definition of `exempt public body' in subsection 159GE(1) by including in that definition an STB, the income of which is wholly exempt from tax. This is a consequential amendment to ensure the section continues to have its intended effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards amendment to item 10, amendment 7 amends proposed section 159GEA by omitting the words `an STB' and substituting them with `a prescribed excluded STB'. This amendment, along with the amendment to item 14, amendment 8, ensures that STBs which are taxable are treated as exempt for the purposes of division 16D of the act until those STBs are sold to private interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the amendment to item 14, amendment 8 ensures that items 5 and 10 are given a date of effect of 1 July 1995. Due to an oversight, the amendments which deemed otherwise taxable STBs to be exempt for the purposes of section 51AD and division 16D had a date of effect of 1 July 1994. The agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories is that those provisions shall apply from 1 July 1995, the date from which only bodies due for privatisation by 1 July 1997 will be listed as taxable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the amendment to item 19, the bill currently excludes state and territory owned superannuation funds from the new sales tax exemption for state and territory bodies. Amendment 9 will remove that exclusion so that state and territory superannuation funds will now be exempt from sales tax if they satisfy the necessary conditions and are not otherwise excluded. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under proposed section 139DC, an employer can, under certain conditions, claim a deduction for the imputed cost of qualifying shares or rights provided to employees. Subsection 139DC(2) limits this deduction to the market value of the shares or rights or to $500, whichever is less. Amendment 11 will limit the deduction to the discount given to the person receiving the shares or rights. Without such an amendment, an employer can claim a deduction under this concession even where the employee has received no benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining the market value of shares or rights under subdivision F of the proposed division 13A, it is necessary to refer to values quoted on `an approved stock exchange'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under new item 7A, some shares which fall to be taxed under the new employee share scheme provisions may also, in some circumstances, be subject to tax under foreign investment fund provisions. To avoid any double taxation, and to ensure that the deferral concessions of the employee share scheme provisions remains available, amendment 15 will exempt the shares or rights from the foreign investment fund provisions for the period prior to the time at which those shares or rights are taxed under the employee share scheme provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to amendments to item 10. Item 10 of schedule 2 provides three transitional arrangements for the new employee share scheme provisions. These are contained in sub-items 3, 4 and 5. While the transitional arrangement in sub-item 5 require a taxpayer to make an election for it to apply, sub-items 3 and 4 apply automatically. Amendments 16, 18, 21, and 23 allow those taxpayers who fall within sub-items 3 and 4 to elect that those sub-items not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional arrangement of sub-item 10(3) of schedule 2 currently applies only to shares or rights of the employer company. Amendment 17 extends this arrangement to shares or rights of the holding company of the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the transitional arrangement of sub-item 10(4), there is a requirement that the employee share scheme be approved by shareholders before the date the new employee share scheme arrangements are announced. As some overseas jurisdictions may not require their employee share schemes to be approved by shareholders, amendments 19 and 20 ensure this requirement is not necessary in these cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in sub-item 10(7), the term `public company' has been given the same meaning as in the Corporations Law. It is possible that in some situations the term `public company' in this provision may exclude foreign holding companies and companies which have been established by statute. Amendment 22 defines the term to include companies listed on approved stock exchanges and companies which have been established by statute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the coalition will not be opposing the amendments which have been moved by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), but we will be opposing schedule 2 after it has been amended. The reason we will be opposing schedule 2, to reiterate our position, is that we believe the government's propositions and proposals are fundamentally flawed and that, in fact, rather than aiding employee share ownership in Australia, the provisions in this bill actually threaten the viability of current share schemes and restrict the potential for future expansion of employee share ownership in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the third attempt by the government to deal with employee share ownership in 13 months, and it is its third failure. The justification for much of the changes contained in this bill, and even in the amendments which are now being moved by the Assistant Treasurer, is, firstly, that we want to bring employee share ownership to the availability of all employees in Australia and, secondly, that there are some rorts and abuses of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would think that if it were the case that there are rorts and abuses of the system, the Assistant Treasurer and other members of the government would be able to come into this place and signal, in chapter and verse, the rorts and the abuses that are alleged to be occurring. But when we ask them to do so, there is a deafening silence which crosses the length and breadth of this nation. All we get is this general assertion that it is known in the industry that there are some rorts and abuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government is making changes to the taxation laws of this country based on the assertion that there are rorts and abuses of the system, it is incumbent upon it to set out what those particular rorts and abuses are, rather than make this general allegation, implying as it does that those persons and companies involved in employee share ownership are somehow rorting the system. The companies involved include some of the most major companies in Australia&mdash;the BHPs of Australia and the Labor government's former icon, the Commonwealth Bank, which it is now selling off. Qantas is about to make offers of this nature in its share release prospectus to the general public and as part of its general transitional arrangements. There is simply no real evidence of what the government alleges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we oppose this particular measure is that there are aspects of the proposal which are simply going to work against employees gaining, in any real sense, a share of the company in which they are employed. For example, the proposal seeks to tax many employees before any benefit is realised. The five-year maximum deferral period will result in virtually all international share option plans attracting tax before the employee acquires a share, leaving employees with an unfunded tax liability. The qualifying conditions for obtaining the discount are too tight. There is no refund on tax paid on options that lapse. The valuation rules are complex and unrealistic, particularly for options. Finally, most employee share schemes of foreign owned companies will be taxed up front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than aiding and abetting the many hundreds of thousands of workers in Australian industries and Australian businesses to do that which we on this side would seek&mdash;that is, have a share in the ownership of those businesses&mdash;this legislation will in fact have the opposite effect. It will restrict the ability of employees to obtain a real part of the ownership of the companies in which they work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hear the Assistant Treasurer saying that we do not have policies. Of course, it piques the government at the present time that the policies of the government are somehow being challenged when flaws are shown to exist in them. What does the government expect? Does it expect that in relation to every piece of legislation, even though industry groups say it is flawed&mdash;that happened in relation to this piece of legislation&mdash;we are going to get up here and cheer and say, `Bravo, this is a great piece of legislation?' Of course not. We are going to carry out our responsibilities to bring to the notice of the government and the people of Australia the flaws that exist in legislation, such as those that exist in this piece. As I said, the coalition will not be opposing the further amendments which are being made to the schedule, but we will oppose the schedule itself. </PARA>

<PARA>Part of this bill gives rollover relief from accrued capital gains and losses where certain superannuation funds merge. The amendments allow the trustee of a transferor fund that merges on or after 1 July 1994 to roll over any capital gains losses that would be realised as a result of the merger where a number of conditions apply. In particular, two of these conditions are of concern to the coalition. The first is that the merger take place between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997. The second is that the merging funds be qualifying superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two provisions relate to the amendments which have been circulated in the name of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). In particular, the first amendment deals with the timing of mergers. It is the belief of the coalition that the application of the rollover relief ought not be restricted simply to mergers which occur between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997. If this is an amendment to the legislation, which in principle is desirable&mdash;and that would seem to be the case because the government is moving this way&mdash;then why restrict it to mergers between funds that occur only between 1 July 1994 and 1 July 1997?

<PARA>This amendment has been circulated to honourable members in the name of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). The provisions of schedule 4 in the bill relate to local government councillors. The bill seeks to amend the definition of `salary or wages' and `employee, employer' in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to ensure a number of things&mdash;namely, that persons in the capacity of a local government councillor are excluded from the definition of `employee'; that members of an eligible local governing body are included in the definition of `employee'; and payments made to local government councillors, other than those who are members of an eligible local governing body, are excluded from the definition of `salary or wages'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment seeks to ensure that payments received by local government councillors in the course of their duties are exempt from the scope of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act, but that payments to members of eligible local governing bodies will continue to be subject to the requirements of the superannuation guarantee legislation. Currently the remuneration allowances of members of local government bodies are exempt from the PAYE collection system, unless the body unanimously elects to be treated as an eligible local government body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment applies to assessments of super guarantee shortfall for the year beginning on 1 July 1993 and later years. The government formally announced this measure on 26 June 1994 through the then Minister for Local Government, the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), who wrote to local government councils in July 1992 advising that, as far as local government elected members were concerned, the new superannuation arrangements would only apply to councillors in receipt of salaries. However, the amendments are only retrospective to 1 July 1993, whilst the superannuation guarantee levy commenced on 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation recommended in June 1992 that the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992 be amended by the government to ensure that local government councillors who receive salary or wages are covered by the superannuation guarantee while other local government councillors not be covered by the superannuation guarantee. We have criticised the application of the superannuation guarantee legislation to local government councillors and the failure of the government to enact legislation to give effect to the letter of the former Minister for Local Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1993 Senator Macdonald introduced a private member's bill, which passed through the Senate, with the same objectives as the current provisions but dating back to 1 July 1992. The effect of this amendment is to remove or omit the date `1 July 1993' and substitute for it `1 July 1992'. Given that that would then be consistent with the introduction of the superannuation guarantee, we believe that this is an amendment which would then clarify the situation completely and place the situation of local government councillors on a consistent footing with the date of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy. </PARA>

Secondly, amendments will mean that super funds have to refund contributions already made. I am informed that there would be costs involved&mdash;for example, they may have to amend trust deeds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other very important issue which needs to be addressed in the context of this amendment is the effect which the government's rule is having not just on local government councillors but on doctors and other professional people who have been caught up in what could best be described as an unforeseen consequence. Let me give an example: if doctors have a private practice&mdash;and have consequently made private superannuation arrangements&mdash;and have also worked in a hospital, the effect of the current arrangement is that they are caught by what I call the 10 per cent rule. That is, if 10 per cent or more of their income is related specifically to the activities undertaken in a professional capacity in a hospital, it effectively means that their private superannuation is negatived because they are included in the superannuation guarantee arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect that this has had on many doctors&mdash;especially anaesthetists and various specialised service providers&mdash;has been enormous. It is clearly inequitable. I hasten to add that it does not apply only to those people working under contract in a hospital. There is a perception that this applies only when a person actually has a contract to provide services in a hospital environment. I am reliably informed by representations which I have received that it affects an anaesthetist who is under contract to a surgeon to facilitate an operational procedure. The anaesthetist does not, therefore, have a legal relationship per se with the hospital but is also caught up in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications of that are quite wide ranging. I certainly urge the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is at the table, to review this matter. As we have suggested, to make the commencing date 1 July 1992 instead of 1 July 1993 would be a serious attempt to overcome what is becoming a serious anomaly. The 10 per cent rule as it currently applies affects a wider selection of people than just local government councillors. It covers a whole range of professional services&mdash;especially in the medical area&mdash;which are being provided. I suggest to the minister that this rule is having an effect which can only be described as an unforeseen circumstance. I think the government's actions are grotesquely unfair. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments, which were circulated in the name of the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), relate to the provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) pertaining to late lodgment penalties. One of the provisions of the bill is to introduce a new regime of penalties for late lodgment of income tax returns. For relevant entities and instalment taxpayers, a flat penalty system applies. They will be liable for a penalty at the rate of $25 per week for the period where they are late in lodging an income tax return, subject to a maximum penalty of $500&mdash;that is, equal to 20 weeks&mdash;regardless of the level of tax payable; that is, a penalty will be applied if there is a late lodgment of the return even if it subsequently comes to light that there was no tax payable or a loss was incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxpayers affected by this provision include: companies, superannuation funds, approved deposit funds, pooled superannuation funds, trustees of corporate unit trusts and trustees of public trading trusts. The late payment penalties will continue to apply on the basis of the amount of tax outstanding. The commissioner has a discretion to remit the late lodgment penalty and the objection procedures of part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act apply. These late penalties consist of a penalty tax at eight per cent per annum and a penalty interest at the statutory rate&mdash;for the period January 1995 to June 1995&mdash;of 10.8 per cent, which is calculated on a daily basis from the date tax becomes due and payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of penalties for late lodgment of returns where no tax is payable has been criticised by many as a revenue raiser. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, for example, has called for this provision to be dropped or, at least, deferred by the government. It claims that the provision will place unacceptable burdens on small business. Apparently, the Australian Taxation Office has argued that the penalty was needed to assist in the improvement of its statistical collection. Companies with no tax bill which have not lodged returns may now be penalised. This may lead to increased compliant costs to lodge these returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal amendment which is being moved&mdash;there are some consequential amendments&mdash;inserts the following subsection into the bill:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`(2A)If income tax is not payable by a person in relation to a year of income no penalty is payable under subsection (1) in respect of the person's failure to furnish a return in relation to that year of income.'"</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, we are saying that if there is no tax payable then there ought not be a penalty imposed, or if there is a situation where a loss has been incurred and there is a late lodgment then these automatic penalties should not apply. For that reason, we are moving these amendments to the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to bring the Queensland Industry Development Corporation, QIDC, under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. QIDC is a financial institution which is wholly owned by the Queensland government and which undertakes commercial lending to primary, secondary and tertiary industry within the state of Queensland. While in recent years it has sought to adhere to Reserve Bank standards, QIDC has not been formally supervised by the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government has recently corporatised QIDC and as part of this exercise is seeking to enhance the accountability of QIDC by enabling it to be brought under Reserve Bank supervision. This bill amends the Banking Act 1959 to bring QIDC under Reserve Bank prudential supervision. To this end, the Queensland government has recently referred its banking powers, with respect to QIDC, to the Commonwealth. Specifically, this bill includes QIDC within the definition of a bank in section 5 of the Banking Act 1959, thereby establishing a legislative basis for Reserve Bank supervision of QIDC. This will ensure that QIDC follows Reserve Bank requirements and is subject to the supervision of the Reserve Bank in relation to prudential matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government endorses Reserve Bank supervision of QIDC. As a substantial commercial lender, QIDC effectively operates as a business bank and its formal supervision by the Reserve Bank is entirely appropriate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has indicated, this bill is before the House because the Queensland government has sought to enhance the accountability of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation by enabling it to be brought under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. That is being facilitated in the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill by listing the QIDC under the definition in section 5 of the Banking Act 1959. This establishes a legislative basis for the Reserve Bank supervision of the QIDC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes provisions complementary to Queensland legislation, under which the Queensland government transferred its constitutional banking power, as it relates specifically to the QIDC, to the Commonwealth government. The purpose of this measure is to ensure that QIDC follows the requirements of, and is subject to, the supervision of the Reserve Bank in relation to prudential matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate that the coalition does not oppose this legislation. However, there are two or three concerns which I wish to raise in the House. The first matter I wish to raise is the provision of prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank itself. If it is expected, or told to Queensland people, that this somehow provides a degree of insurance or immunity for the activities of the QIDC, then one only needs to look at the report of the Reserve Bank itself to illustrate that that is a limited immunity or a limited insurance which is provided. For example, the Reserve Bank stated in its annual report for the year ending 30 June 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prudential supervision does not have as an objective the immunisation of banks from the risk of loss.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Managers and shareholders should factor the inevitability of the economic cycle into their decision-making, and they must pay the price for errors of judgment and carelessness.</PARA>
<PARA>In his remarks to the Queensland parliament, the Queensland Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, pointed to Reserve Bank supervision as an insurance against loss by taxpayers. To suggest that somehow prudential supervision will, by itself, provide an insurance policy against any loss that could be incurred by the QIDC as a bank and an insurance against loss by Queensland taxpayers is somewhat misleading. One has only to look at what happened to banks in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia to see that the ultimate insurance for such activities is not the Reserve Bank through its prudential supervision but, in fact, the taxpayers, the constituents, of those states themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I wish to raise is the activities of the bank and what seemed to be suggested to the people of Queensland that the QIDC would be able to do. If honourable members look at the explanation of the Queensland QIDC bill, they will see that the Treasurer of Queensland, Mr De Lacy, told the Queensland parliament that the QIDC would not be able to call itself a bank because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not able to fully perform as a bank in that it cannot provide retail banking facilities or provide finance for what are essentially owner-occupied homes.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although QIDC would gain the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank, the State legislation precludes the Commonwealth of Australia from requiring QIDC to possess a banking authority to carry out the business of banking.</PARA>
<PARA>The Queensland Treasurer summed up by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This option means that although QIDC is defined as a `bank' under the Banking Act 1959&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Commonwealth act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is not authorised to operate as a bank in the wider sense because it does not have a banking authority.</PARA>
<PARA>This bank, if one looks at the speech that has just been made by the Assistant Treasurer, is able to carry out a whole range of banking activities. I quote the Assistant Treasurer's remarks prior to mine in this chamber today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">QIDC is a financial institution which is wholly owned by the Queensland government and which undertakes commercial lending to primary, secondary and tertiary industry within the state of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no restriction on the activities of the QIDC and as a bank it can carry out a full range of banking functions. So for Mr De Lacy to indicate to the people of Queensland that somehow prudential supervision and the passage of this legislation and the complementary legislation in the Queensland parliament are going to restrict the activities of the QIDC is simply misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes it further, the QIDC will, under the very provisions of this legislation, be able to entitle itself and call itself a bank in any other part of Australia. So anybody who would be seeking to invest or to have some operation in relation to the QIDC, for example a resident of New South Wales, Victoria or any of the other states, would for all intents and purposes and under the terms of this legislation be dealing with a bank constituted as such under the authority of this bill and the authority of the complementary bill in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was somewhat misleading for the Treasurer of Queensland to suggest to the Queensland parliament and to the people of Queensland that this would in some way restrict the activities of the QIDC. In fact, the passage of this very legislation has the opposite effect: it gives the<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">QIDC a wide range of banking authority under the Commonwealth and under the legislation of Queensland as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter I want to raise is what this means in terms of the direction of banking itself. It is interesting that in some respects this indicates that the Queensland government is moving in a direction which is opposite to that being taken by state governments elsewhere in Australia and, in relation to the proposal by the Commonwealth to sell its share in the Commonwealth Bank, opposite to that which the Commonwealth has taken. We see other states getting out of the business of banking. The Commonwealth is doing that in its budget proposals for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Yet under the direction of the Goss government it seems to be moving through this legislation in the opposite direction, namely, by expanding the operation of the QIDC and turning it into a more fully fledged bank than it has operated as at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is curious and intriguing because the Premier of Queensland has said in parliament that he did not resile from the position that `state governments should not be in the banking and insurance business'. Yet in an indirect way this does involve the state government of Queensland in the banking and insurance business. Whilst there is nothing to suggest that the activities of the QIDC are anything but carried out in the most professional and most competent manner, it is a curious matter that we have a different direction being taken here in relation to banking by a state than has been taken by the other states in Australia after the disastrous occurrences with banks such as Tricontinental and others, and different from the direction which is being taken by the Commonwealth in relation to the Commonwealth Bank itself. Apart from those concerns, the opposition will not be opposing this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995, to talk about the purposes of the bill and to indicate my full support and the support of all Queensland members of this parliament for this legislation. As has been outlined by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), this is complementary legislation to similar legislation that was passed in the state parliament of Queensland some months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Industry Development Corporation commenced operations in July 1986. The main functions of the QIDC are the provision of financial services to Queensland industry and the administration in Queensland of certain federal and state business and rural assistance schemes, including the rural adjustment scheme, the natural disasters assistance scheme, the small business debt assistance scheme and the rural housing scheme. The QIDC provides a broad range of products, including development capital, interest rate swaps, bridging loans, mortgages, commercial bills and investment services. It is a very important institution for the economic welfare of Queensland and Queensland businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of 30 June 1994, the QIDC had net assets of $151.335 million and total operating revenue of $248.444 million. Government business enterprises in Queensland are currently undergoing a process of corporatisation. The reform and restructuring of the QIDC is a part of that process. It should be noted that the administration of the QIDC under the Goss Labor government is in marked contrast to the administration during its formative years under the National Party regime that we, thankfully, threw out of office on 2 December 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The QIDC was a potential financial disaster when it was taken over by the Goss Labor government in December of 1989. If it had not been for the sound administration that came in on 2 December 1989 and the very sound administration by the Goss Labor government of the QIDC, the problems that were alluded to in terms of other state financial institutions could very well have been visited upon the QIDC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the election of the Goss Labor government, the QIDC was a considerable risk to Queensland taxpayers because of the way in which the National Party administration had supervised its operations. It had used the QIDC as a slush bucket for its own cronyism and pork-barrelling. It was a breeding ground for the corruption and pork-barrelling that was endemic in the National Party administration prior to 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were not for the election of the Goss Labor government, there would have been a major financial disaster, and Queensland taxpayers would have been responsible for paying for it. Thankfully, the Labor government of Wayne Goss was elected on 2 December 1989, and sound financial administration was put into place&mdash;and I can verify those statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An independent review of QIDC was undertaken in 1990. It found substantial evidence of political interference by National Party members and ministers in the operation of the QIDC. That review identified cases of commercial conflict of interest with directors and staff; lack of proper board leadership; poor or no risk management systems; and examples of rorting of government assistance schemes. That is the track record of the previous National Party government's supervision of the QIDC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, according to today's speakers list, a number of my Queensland colleagues, particularly a number of my Queensland National Party colleagues, will be speaking on this bill. I am sure it is no coincidence. I am sure they are speaking on this bill today because they want to use the opportunity to try to engage in a bit of political doubletalk with regard to the Queensland state election. They are going to try to use the debate on this legislation to prop up their failing colleagues in the Queensland state election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have the facts on the record before we start hearing the distortions that I am sure some of my National Party colleagues will come out with. The fact is that an independent financial review of the administration of the QIDC by the previous National Party government proved, beyond doubt, that that National Party administration was guilty, in its operations of the QIDC, of using political interference. Members of the National Party used the taxpayers' funds which the QIDC had supervision of to pork-barrel their own electorates. They were also guilty of poor administration and poor management of the QIDC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will come as no surprise to the people of Queensland, because they saw that type of endemic problem within the administration of the previous National Party state government across all areas of administration in Queensland. This was the same National Party administration that saw five of its ministers convicted of and gaoled for various levels of corruption. We saw its former leader, its former Premier, tried for corruption and for contempt, and we saw the Queensland Police Commissioner and half of the senior members of the Queensland Police Service proven to be corrupt and on the take. </PARA>

One of the very good examples of that was the way in which they administered the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. There was an independent financial review of the QIDC that clearly indicated that they used the funds of the QIDC for corruption and pork-barrelling of their own electorates. No phoney attempt by National Party members opposite to try to silence me by calling quorums is going to stop me emphasising the fact that the people of Queensland know the truth about the National Party&mdash;and there is no way they are going to put the National Party back into power so that it can get its grubby fingers back into taxpayers' money in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Queensland government is seeking through this legislation to put prudent financial auditing requirements and prudent regulatory requirements in place so that the Reserve Bank is able to adequately supervise the operations of the QIDC. Interruptions from members of the National Party are not going to silence me. The members of the National Party should hang their heads in shame.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that under the Goss Labor government the QIDC is no longer going to be used as a political brown paper bag, which was the way it was used under the former National Party administration. Instead of being used as a slush fund for political favours for the rural and regional areas of certain National Party members, under the Goss Labor government the QIDC has now diversified its lending portfolio to include secondary and tertiary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The QIDC is now a much broader investment portfolio bank, which is designed to support the depth of Queensland industries, and not just narrow sectional interests. That is why we have this legislation before us today. QIDC is a development corporation designed to benefit all Queenslanders and to benefit all Queensland industries, not just the narrow sectional interests that the National Party represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very good example of that. Recently, on the border between my electorate and that of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), a national relay service was established to assist deaf people and people with communication difficulties. That service was established with assistance from the QIDC, which saw it as not only a sound business enterprise, because QIDC would be paid for the phone calls that it is providing the relay service for, but also a major community service. The service will also receive $21 million of Commonwealth funding over the next three years&mdash;joint funding from the Department of Communications and the Arts and the Department of Human Services and Health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the QIDC that gave that service a start, and that gave it the money to get under way. That national relay service is going to benefit deaf people and people with communication difficulties throughout Australia. It is funded by the QIDC. Such a loan would never have been possible under the former National Party administration because, to get any sort of  money from the QIDC, it was then necessary to be a member of the National Party or a mate of the National Party. That no longer occurs because the QIDC is now on a sound financial footing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The QIDC still has a very strong rural focus. Its lending to rural producers has been increased from $250 million to more than $1,000 million in 1995. So the QIDC still has that very strong rural focus, but it has also diversified and broadened its interests into a lot of other areas as well. The reason the legislation is before the House today is that the Reserve Bank of Australia has the power, under the Banking Act 1959, to supervise the prudential standards applicable to this bank, as it does with all other banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Menzies made some points in his address about the fact that by this legislation the QIDC can operate as a normal bank like every other bank registered under the charter. That is recognised, but it is not the intention of the government to go that way. The Queensland government has made it quite clear that it is not going to expand the role of the QIDC into a full state bank with all the normal operations a bank would have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a clear political statement that the Queensland government has made. It believes the benefits to the people of Queensland, by bringing the QIDC under Reserve Bank supervision, is very important. Such an arrangement ensures that all taxpayers in Queensland will know that this bank is adequately and very carefully being supervised, that its operations are open to full public scrutiny and that there will be none of the slush fund and corrupt actions that were the hallmark of the previous National Party administration of the QIDC. That is not just me the politician talking, for the track record of corruption and misuse of QIDC funds was clearly outlined in an independent examination of the QIDC in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move to RBA supervision has not been done by stealth. It is not some sort of secret deal. It is being made clear at all times that the QIDC would become technically a bank for the purposes of prudential supervision, but the government has made it clear that there is no intention to expand into that role. What is relevant is that the QIDC is now a prudentially sound financial institution which is free of corruption and political interference and is now subject to rigorous independent supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restructuring and the realignment of the QIDC is just one of many major achievements of the Goss Labor government which has a record second to none in Australia for financial management and prudent dealings with taxpayers' funds. The operation and supervision of the QIDC is just one example of the way in which the Goss Labor government has been extremely careful to ensure that the state of Queensland is well run and well administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many indicators to show, as independent market assessments from around the world have shown, that the Queensland state government and the Queensland financial situation is second to none. I will quote from the Natwest capital markets report of October 1994. The report was called `State of the states' and it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be hard to find a national or sub-national government anywhere in the world that has a superior financial position to Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>This unique financial position has enabled businesses throughout Queensland to have a huge competitive advantage. While the other states use, on average, $25 in every $100 of their own source revenue in servicing their $75 billion debt load, Queensland actually earns net interest income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are net debt free in Queensland. Queensland has the lowest per capita tax collections of any state in Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that in 1994-95 residents in other states were paying an average 37 per cent more in state taxes than the average paid by Queenslanders. Queensland is the only state to be net debt free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Goss government has completely eliminated the net debt of $4.2 billion that was inherited from the previous National Party government. Let there be no excuses such as, `That was all because of the sound policies of the previous National Party government.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill. The QIDC, as we affectionately know it in Queensland, commenced operation in July 1986 under its new name. Prior to that it had a role as a development bank in Queensland. One of the great things about the QIDC is that it has always kept its base out there in rural Australia. As we have seen only recently, the major commercial banks are continuing to withdraw their presence in a physical sense from rural Australia, while the QIDC has been expanding its operations, particularly in rural Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The QIDC offers very important banking services to the people of rural Australia. In future, the void that is being created by the withdrawal of the major commercial banks from rural Queensland may be filled by banks such as the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. The main functions of the Queensland Industry Development Corporation are the provision of financial services to Queensland industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These include a broad range of products, such as development capital, interest rate swaps, bridging loans, mortgages, commercial bills and investment services. It is also responsible for the administration of Commonwealth and state business and rural assistance schemes. We all know of the situation out there in rural Australia, because of the high interest rates that are a legacy of the Labor administration here in Canberra. We know what those interest rates have meant to rural communities, not only to the farm sector but also to the small business sector right across this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the schemes that the QIDC administers are the rural adjustment scheme, the natural disaster assistance scheme, the rural housing scheme and the small business debtor scheme. It is a bank that has a major role in rural Australia and in rural communities generally. The QIDC is not only a bank which lends to the agricultural sector, as did the former Agricultural Bank of Queensland, it now lends to a broader cross-section of the community and administers many schemes, both state and federal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to subject the QIDC, for the first time, to prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. These are the same standards which apply to banks, and relate to matters such as capital adequacy and prudential risk management of bank assets. This arrangement will be implemented by including the QIDC in the definition of a `bank' under the Commonwealth's Banking Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a stark reminder of the duplicity of the Goss government and why Queenslanders should not trust it with their future on July 15. On repeated occasions the Queensland Labor Party, both in and out of government, gave cast-iron guarantees that the traditional role of the QIDC would be respected, and that its prime purpose would be to promote the interests and development of Queensland. On repeated occasions the Premier has stated that the QIDC would not become a bank, with all the implications that this would carry for the bank's operations. Premier Goss gave these assurances as recently as last year, when introducing legislation complementary to that now before this House. He said that the QIDC would not become another bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the net result of declaring the QIDC a bank under section 5 of the Commonwealth's Banking Act, will be to give it a complete range of banking powers. The Premier's assurances obviously amount to nothing. Whilst this breach of firm undertakings is bad enough, the consequences for Queensland of the corporation's change of status could well be diabolical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this legislation, this great Queensland institution will be subject to federal banking controls. The member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) was earlier referring to the corruption or the maladministration of the previous conservative administration in Queensland. He failed to tell the House that the Queensland government inherited a very well managed state. The finances were in excellent order, and the QIDC was a bank that was fulfilling a role. We only have to look at Labor administrations in Victoria and in South Australia to find that a bank under a Labor administration in Victoria cost the taxpayers $2 billion to bail out and in South Australia, notwithstanding the fact that it was under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. The cost to the taxpayers was $2.2 billion. No such evidence of this sort of failure within a state controlled lending institution can be levelled at the former administration in Queensland. One can witness also the former administrations of Western Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moreton berates the House with points about a previous administration which left Queensland in a great position. The Queensland Industry Development Corporation was not broke; it was not costing the taxpayers any money. In fact, as the member for Moreton said, the rating of Queensland for its financial performance ranks second to none. The Goss administration inherited that position; it did not build it. It is about time members on the other side of the House told the truth about where the great legacy that was handed to the Labor administration came from, something the people of Queensland know very well. We must also always remind members on the other side of the House that the Labor Party cannot be trusted to be in charge of money, particularly taxpayers' money. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Industry Development Corporation, as I said earlier, has a proud past and I hope it has a proud future in developing the state. One of the great visionary projects which have been promoted by independent commentators and investors recently has been the building of the great inland rail bridge between Brisbane and Melbourne via the inland towns of Goondiwindi and Moree, through Narrabri and the heart of the Murray-Darling Basin. Such a bridge could well mean the further development of value adding industries where 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural production comes from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The QIDC could well play a role in the development of that visionary scheme, particularly through the provision of finance. Queensland and the port of Brisbane are so near to the great Murray-Darling basin river system where 50 per cent of Australia's agricultural production comes from. It is those sorts of projects which the QIDC and other development organisations could well look at as projects which would bring benefits not only to Queensland, to the people who live along that rail link, but also to the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Industry Development Corporation will now take on the status of a bank and have a wider role in rural Queensland, perhaps taking over the role of some of the major banks. That is a role which I commend to the bank. I only hope that it keeps up a presence in rural Australia. Perhaps it will find a niche under its new charter to be more of a bank out there when the major commercial banks leave rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that because it is going to become a bank with full prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank of Australia it does not go the way of our major commercial banks that are leaving rural Australia. I hope that it does not in turn, because of the decisions of economic rationalists that are made at a capital city level, withdraw its agencies from rural Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important that it consider a service to the community in rural Queensland as well as attempt to broaden its base into more development opportunities by lending in areas beyond the rural and small business sector. I hope that the economic rationalists are not in there saying that it is not commercially sound to have these branch structures throughout rural Queensland. I hope that we do not see the QIDC going down the same path as did many of our major commercial banks that have removed their physical presence from rural Queensland. Whilst it is their right to make those commercial judgments and withdraw their physical presence from rural Queensland, I think there is a role for government to ensure that there are banking services provided to the people who live in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on a comment made by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in relation to the Commonwealth Bank and what its privatisation and sale could mean. In answer to a question from the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) the other day whether free banking services would still be available under a fully privatised Commonwealth Bank to almost 4.5 million pensioners, students and veterans, the Treasurer failed to give an assurance to this House and to those people&mdash;those 4.5 million people, those low income families who bank now with the Commonwealth Bank and those who may have a housing loan&mdash;that they will continue to have free banking services once it is a fully commercial bank and there is no longer any ownership by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely important that we ensure that out there in rural Australia we still have banking facilities that are available not only to the business sector and the farm sector but also to people on low incomes&mdash;families, pensioners and veterans&mdash;so that they have access to banking services. It is one of the fundamental services that any community needs. It is not good enough to say that with modern technology you are going to be able to replace banks with plastic cards and electronic funds transfer and that this will be able to be a service that will be understood and be completely adequate for the people who live and work in rural and remote Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I trust that the QIDC, with its changed status as a result of this bill, will continue to develop and push its agencies and its branch level activities out into rural Queensland whilst at the same time it develops into a larger, more commercial bank in the activities of capital city lending and opportunities in the wider investment world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the previous speaker and shadow minister, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), speak on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995, you would think that there were no problems with the QIDC when the Labor government came into power in Queensland in 1989. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that in 1989 the Goss government was faced with a real problem, in that the QIDC presented a great risk to the taxpayers of Queensland at that time. If the situation had been allowed to continue, as happened in other states, the Queensland taxpayers would have been required to pick up the tab for years of National Party mismanagement of the QIDC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Goss government had to do something about that and in 1990 it got an independent academic, Mr John Polichronis, to undertake a report into the QIDC. The report that Mr Polichronis gave was damning of the previous National Party government and damning of its administration of the QIDC. It showed evidence of political interference in commercial matters under the National Party government. As well, it showed cases of commercial conflict of interest by the National Party appointed directors and staff of the board of the QIDC. It also gave evidence of lack of board leadership and abuse of schemes administered by the relevant division of the QIDC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be surprised about that, given the record of that government. That was the government that would not even introduce a public accounts committee into the parliament of Queensland. It would not even have parliamentary scrutiny of any government institutions. That was the government, as was said earlier, that operated by the brown paper bag. If you wanted to become a knight, that required a financial transaction with the previous National Party government. If you wanted a knighthood, you sent some money in a brown paper bag to Bjelke-Petersen House. That was the sort of financial transaction that was highlighted by the Fitzgerald royal commission. So that is the sort of government the people of Queensland had before 1989. That is the sort of government that was highlighted by the Fitzgerald royal commission and that is the sort of government that was highlighted by Mr Polichronis in his report on the QIDC. So, far from the picture that was painted by the shadow minister, who is at the table, the QIDC was in a mess. Not only that; potentially it was in the same situation as those other unfortunate financial institutions in the southern states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But a Labor administration in Queensland saw the situation, picked up the report that I referred to and introduced reforms. One of the major reforms is before the House today, that is, bringing the QIDC under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. National Party members do not seem to like that. I can assure them they will not be in government after the middle of next month, but I suspect that they think they have a chance. They want to get their finger in the till again, so they do not want the QIDC to have prudential supervision by the Reserve Bank&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EV5">Mr DODD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says that is rubbish. It is certainly the situation that after that report by Mr Polichronis in 1990 the Goss government acted to reform the QIDC. One of the reforms was the corporatisation of the QIDC. The second reform was to bring the QIDC under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank. There was an option of bringing the QIDC into the Queensland Office of Financial Supervision, but that institution looks more at smaller banks and building societies and it was considered more appropriate that the Reserve Bank be the supervisor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very significant to note that the Goss government has led the way in terms of national reform of building societies and credit unions. The national financial institutions scheme is the model scheme for other states and territories and the Australian Financial Institutions Commission has its headquarters in Brisbane. So there is no doubt that there has been significant recognition of the Queensland government's achievement in this area. Queensland is widely recognised as having the strongest financial position of all the Australian states and, indeed, its financial position is unrivalled amongst its competitors in the Asia-Pacific region. The Natwest capital market report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the states</EMPHASIS>, in October 1994, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be hard to find a national or sub-national government anywhere in the world that has a superior financial position to Queensland</PARA>
<PARA>That is the true situation. Of course, this unique financial position has given business in Queensland a huge competitive advantage. While other states use on average $25 in every $100 of their own source revenue in servicing their $75 million debt load, Queensland actually earns net interest income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland is the only state to be debt free. The combined debt of the other states and territories is about $75 billion. The Goss government has completely eliminated the debt of $4.2 billion inherited from the previous National Party government. Indeed, by June 1996, the Queensland government is expected to have net assets of $1.6 billion. So let us not hear any of the nonsense that has been bandied about here that somehow the Goss government does not have a good financial record in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the QIDC, the QIDC has been substantially reformed in other areas. The government schemes that I previously referred to, the government schemes that were previously manipulated by the National Party government, have been removed from the QIDC and are now administered by the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority. The QIDC is now run by an independent professional board&mdash;no more National Party cronies on the board. It is an independent board that is running the scheme very well. I would not want the House to think that, by changing its emphasis and transferring the government schemes to the administration of the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority, there is a neglect of the rural sector. I think there was some suggestion in the previous speaker's remarks that that was the case. The proof is in the figures, because lending to rural producers from the QIDC increased from $250 million in 1986 to over $1,000 million in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before this legislation could come into place, the Reserve Bank expected and got an audit of the QIDC. The Reserve Bank found that the systems of the QIDC were of the highest standard. One may compare that with the report which was brought down in 1990, which referred to cronyism and to conflict of interest, and see the vast difference between the administration under the Goss Labor government and that under the previous National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the only monitoring of the QIDC that takes place. The QIDC is monitored also by the government owned enterprise unit within Treasury. So there is a whole range of systems. There is now a public accounts committee in the Queensland parliament. Someone coming from any other parliament in the world would say, `So what? We have had public accounts committees for 10 or 20 years,' but in Queensland it has come in only since 1989, when the Goss government came in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet these people claim that they can govern Queensland. These are the people that claim that they are ready to govern again. I think the Queensland people will have a very different message for them and a very different message for the Liberal and National Party government&mdash;or the National-Liberal government, I am sorry, because there will never be a Liberal government in Queensland. We know that a vote for the Liberals in Queensland is really a vote for the Nationals, and that is something that we will be very clearly telling the people of Queensland in the next two or three weeks. </PARA>

That is why this legislation is before the House: if we are to avoid that sort of situation, we have got to have proper supervision.

This is a timely debate on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill because it coincides with the election campaign that is now under way in Queensland. In many respects, this particular debate also brings us, as has been noted on this side, to the important question of credibility as far as the Queensland Goss government is concerned. This may not be a major election issue up there, as I can think of a number of others; nevertheless, this is an important issue and it ought to be an election issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of Queenslanders, once they become completely aware of what the Queensland government is up to, will be a little unsure about what the government actually proposes to do. Earlier this year, the Queensland Treasurer assured the parliament of Queensland that the QIDC was not to become a bank. Clearly, he misled the parliament when he said that, and he has also misled the people of Queensland. He seems to think that this is a debate about semantics. I note that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> editorial of 9 May makes this point, when it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Treasurer must expect to be closely scrutinised on any agency within his brief that has large cheques to offer people with ideas. The Opposition was right to ask the question. A clear answer, without semantics, should be put on the public record. </PARA>

The fact that it will be a bank should be of concern to many Queenslanders because, clearly, governments do not run banks very well.

But the member for Moreton and none of his colleagues want to talk in any balanced way about the state banks of South Australia or Victoria. They really want to avoid those issues. I can understand why they do not want to get into that area because the performance of those state owned banks ought to be&mdash;and will be for a very long time&mdash;a great embarrassment to the Labor Party because the losses in those states amounted to billions of dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be quite clear that, when the QIDC was corporatised and went through that process, its debts were guaranteed and are guaranteed by the Queensland government.

It is not engaged in lending for home loans, which of course is the safe end of the lending spectrum, by and large. And Queenslanders might not be aware that, by virtue of this authority, it is authorised to operate in the derivatives market. I do not want to overstate that because, frankly, I am relieved from discussions I have had with the Governor of the Reserve Bank and others involved in the derivatives area that there is no real cause for concern about our banks' activities in respect of derivatives, which are a genuine part of their operations. </PARA>

<PARA>The fact is that this bank, QIDC, will be operating in a high-risk area, as were the State Bank of South Australia and the State Bank of Victoria. Honourable members should look at the losses they made. I am not casting aspersions on the board of the QIDC at all. It happens to be a very well balanced and qualified board, but the point we are making is that there has been some obfuscation by the Queensland Treasurer about whether it was a bank of not. It is a bank and it is operating as a bank. It is guaranteed by the Queensland government, and that ought to be up-front. </PARA>

In fact, people are heading back in the other direction. But the shingle is up. The QIDC is opening branch offices in southern states. In those states it is seeking retail funds. It is competing in the retail sector for funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another fundamental objection Queenslanders ought to have: the QIDC is competing with the private sector on less than a level playing field.

There was unofficial supervision of the state banks of Victoria and South Australia, but that certainly did not save them. We know&mdash;it is on the public record&mdash;the Reserve Bank was well aware of the potential dangers faced by those institutions months in advance of those dangers becoming public.

Most of us watching were quite aghast that a state government would want to get into that business at all, let alone so unadvisedly.

That is an example of how every Labor government in the history of this country, at both the state and federal level, has ultimately proved itself to be incapable of running the country's affairs on a responsible level. I believe this federal government is as culpable as any other has been. </PARA>

I would like to congratulate Mrs Sheldon, the state shadow Treasurer, who has taken up this issue publicly on a number of occasions in both the parliament and other places.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps in the course of the election campaign broader questions may arise about the future of Suncorp and the QIDC and whether in fact they might be sold for the benefit of Queensland.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet, despite those words, the Queensland government is rushing headlong down the track of getting into the banking business. No doubt there will be some opposition in the Queensland Labor Party to the sale of those particular instrumentalities but that is the way the rest of Australia is moving. Even here there is a move to sell the Commonwealth Bank, and for very good reasons too. We support that sale but we do not support what will be done with the money. It will be a misuse of the money that will be raised. </PARA>

Even the federal Labor Party, for one reason or another, has come to that realisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in support of the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill 1995. This bill seeks to bring the Queensland Industry Development Corporation under the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia. I was interested to hear the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) talk about Compass. It is my understanding that his colleague the member for Fadden (Mr Jull) was most enthusiastic about the government putting taxpayers' money into Compass. As usual there is very little policy cohesion on the opposition side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly should take a great deal of notice of what the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who spoke earlier in this debate, has to say. I refer to the member's attempt at policy when he was the opposition spokesperson on regional and rural development. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important when considering initiatives in the portfolio of Regional and Rural Development&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is an issue that is most important in relation to the QIDC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to distinguish between those which are essentially beneficial to the development of Australian regions and those which will win the Coalition seats in regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say in relation to infrastructure investment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to set a figure ($1 billion, $3 billion&mdash;the actual number is insignificant) as an indication of our commitment to putting roads, dams, port, airports, bridges, whatever, into regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new road/bridge etc is a proven electoral winner.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the member for Maranoa said when he was the opposition spokesperson on regional and rural development. How have those opposite moved on in the area of effective financial responsibility&mdash;an issue that they have made much of in this debate on the QIDC coming under the prudential supervision of RBA? The current spokesperson on this issue, Senator Macdonald, a Queensland senator, spends a lot of his time putting out press releases. He outlined his grand vision in this area to the shadow cabinet in Cairns recently. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy indicates that prior to the election we would be announcing a list of long term visionary projects we would specifically like the Council to investigate and prioritise, for example: Darwin to Alice Railway, turning coastal waters inland&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is always a good policy for the National Party in Central Queensland; it always wants to turn the rivers around&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">rejuvenating the Murray-Darling Basin, Adelaide Airport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long term visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of economic responsibility we can expect from the federal opposition. Those opposite are now engaging in a political point scoring exercise by having a crack at the Queensland government. Politics is the game we are in and I have no problem with those on either side of the House getting into the political debate, but I think it shows the opposition's lack of policy when the best the member for McPherson can say is that it wants the QIDC to be a bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear from the statements of the Queensland Treasurer that the government is trying to make sure that the financial status and independence of the QIDC are protected and that it has very high prudential standards. That is why it is entering into this technical arrangement as far as the QIDC is concerned. It is quite clear that what it is requesting of the Commonwealth government is that the QIDC be defined as a bank under section 5 of the Banking Act. That section requires it to be a bank in only a technical sense. The QIDC is not going to be competing with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that those opposite are from the so-called party of competition but, when you suggest a bit of real competition, they say, `We don't want that. We mustn't have a level playing field here.' The real intent of this legislation is to ensure that there is proper supervision of the QIDC. In doing this, the Queensland government is prepared to refer certain powers to the Commonwealth government. In addition to what the Reserve Bank of Australia will do, the Queensland government has in place very effective supervisory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleagues the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) have previously said, when the Goss government came to power in 1989 an independent report indicated that the QIDC's management had been very poor. There was political interference in commercial matters, cases of commercial conflict of interest with directors and staff, lack of board leadership, poor or no risk management systems in place, and instances of abuse of the schemes of assistance administered by the government schemes division of the QIDC. This effectively meant that the organisation of the QIDC was at very high risk of failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That had to be turned around, as did a lot of major difficulties that were the legacy of years of Joh's management of Queensland. The corporatisation of the QIDC under the government's own Corporations Act came into being on 1 October 1994. Its main purpose was to ensure that the taxpayers of Queensland received the full benefits while at the same time being exposed to minimum risk. What we have ensured not only in the Queensland parliament but also here as part of this bill is that those statutory arrangements are effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important things that the government has done is to move community based facilities, such as the rural adjustment scheme, into an entirely separate organisation. I know this has been most important in the effective operation of the Rural Adjustment Authority and in getting Commonwealth government assistance to people who have been affected by drought. It also means that funds associated with the QIDC are now available to provide investment into core enterprise operations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have the member for Kennedy interjecting as usual. I was quite prepared to listen in silence to the member for McPherson, but it is just too hard for the member for Kennedy to restrain himself. What we do not see from the member for Kennedy is restraint in any direction. After all, he was a member of the Bjelke-Petersen government. Therefore, he has a great deal of responsibility for the criticisms that those of us on this side of the House are making in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have moved a number of the community service obligations out of the QIDC, we have a much more effective operation. However, that does not mean that we, with the QIDC, are moving away from supporting rural investment. If you look at the loan book of the QIDC, you see that as recently as 1992 rural sector loans made up 67 per cent of the total loan book. So the QIDC is still very heavily supporting rural and regional development. However, the reliance on a one-industry sector approach constitutes a major commercial risk. It has diminished over time. It has achieved a much more balanced portfolio. Currently, the rural sector represents about 50 per cent of the QIDC's loan book. That indicates a very proper management of development in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that is quite clear&mdash;I suspect we will not hear it from the member for Kennedy because I heard his contribution in a debate yesterday&mdash;is that, while beef and in particular coalmining are major industries for export not only for Queensland but for the country, the great challenge for Queensland is to diversify its industrial and manufacturing base and to bring on stream other competitive export enterprises. What we do know is that commodities are at the mercy of international trading cycles. It is very important to have an effective investment operation in Queensland to provide for that investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Queensland government has been very successful in the turnaround of the QIDC, giving it a much more effective financial position. That also means that it is part of the achievement of the Queensland government not only to become the only state that is net debt free but also by June 1996 to have expected net assets of $1.6 billion. We are not servicing debt in Queensland because of the prudent financial management of the Goss government, including the Treasurer, Mr de Lacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the member for Leichhardt quoted the Natwest Capital Market's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the states</EMPHASIS>. I think it is worth repeating. In October 1994, it reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it would be hard to find a national or sub-national government anywhere in the world that has a superior financial position to Queensland . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a bad financial reference. It means that not only are we not servicing debt in Queensland but also we have more money to spend on infrastructure and community services. This equates to there being $2 billion more now available to not only keep taxes down but also provide quality infrastructure and community services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Queensland government report recently indicated massive infrastructure projects.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Effectively, this blueprint includes public sector reform, micro-economic reform, further tax concessions but $9 billion worth of infrastructure, programs for development of education and training, research and development, trade and investment. The problem with the National Party is that it can only think about dams and railways, but one of the most effective infrastructure developments is training and developing people skills, human resources, so they can make a contribution to the service sector, which is making a huge contribution to our export income. So we have $3.6 billion worth of capital expenditure already allocated in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infrastructure spending has increased enormously under the Goss Labor government. For instance, I will mention the family services portfolio. In 1989-90 the budget for the Department of Family Services and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs was $159.57 million. Today, in the current budget, it is $500.9 million. So there has been an increase not only in family services but in police, education and hospitals. We had to turn around years and years of neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening to the QIDC's operations in Central Queensland? Just yesterday the official opening of the new premises in Emerald took place. At that opening the chairman stated that the loan book for the branch had gone past $100 million, which makes it one of the largest loan books of any branch of any financial institution in Queensland regional areas. There has been a necessity, both in Rockhampton and Emerald, to move to larger premises and put on more staff because of the development of business investment in those regions. This is also happening at the Mackay and Longreach branches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">QIDC's economics department has just completed a study of the beef cattle industry, with particular reference to Central Queensland, to assist with trade and finance for the export of live cattle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all just too hard for members of the the National Party because they are still back in the bad old days of pork-barrelling and providing a bit of infrastructure here and there to win a few votes. Of course, at that time that was a lot easier because we had a gerrymander. The National Party could govern in its own right with 36 per cent of the vote. We have moved a long way from that period of corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about finalising arrangements that have already been put in place by the state government, having learned from the mistakes made in other states about the support of various state banks. The kind of furphy the member for McPherson peddles is that state governments cannot be responsible in providing infrastructure investment. What is very clear from these arrangements is that the Reserve Bank will have very effective powers of supervision. The Queensland government itself has effective auditing requirements in place to make sure that not only will the QIDC work in the interests of investment in Queensland, but also taxpayers' money will be effectively looked after. In fact, it has already made a profit and will continue to make a profit and put money back into the Treasury for further infrastructure investment and for further services to the people of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for the opposition in the state campaign is that they have not got any policies. They have no track record of financial management on which they can build. Therefore, we are having particular debates in this House along the lines of the ones the opposition is running on this bill and ran yesterday in the MPI on the poverty issue. The opposition can run those arguments and can put that case, but the track record of the Goss government is that of a very effective financial manager.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it is doing with the QIDC indicates its responsibility. Making the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority a separate organisation has meant effective Commonwealth support for primary producers in my electorate and in other parts of Queensland who are still suffering from drought. There is a lot of money available there. I am glad to see that the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority is advertising the fact that it would like to talk to primary producers who are in difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is about efficient, effective and responsible management of the state finances of Queensland, and indeed it is about the Commonwealth government taking an appropriate role to provide a technical definition of banking.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have taken three minutes of my time. Let me talk about the Polichronis report on QIDC. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) was quite right in saying that I was very heavily involved. I was in fact the secretary of the review committee of QIDC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read the Polichronis report and analysed it in great detail. I found it absolutely staggering that the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the member for Leichhardt and the member for Capricornia stood in this place and said that the report referred to corruption. There was not a single reference in the Polichronis report to corruption, from the first page to the last page. The report was highly technical and demonstrated classical economic rationalism throughout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the three members who quoted extensively from the report had not read it. They had absolutely no idea what was in the Polichronis report. Polichronis recommended that QIDC stop being an agricultural bank or anything of that nature and become a purely commercial bank. The reason he recommended this is that he believed QIDC should offer purely commercial interest rates, not preferential interest rates. At that stage, all of QIDC's loans to the public were at two per cent less than those being offered by commercial banks in Queensland. He was reflecting the attitudes, philosophy and self-interest of the other banks in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy was completely opposite to that. In fact, Bill Gunn, the Deputy Premier of Queensland, and I served on the committee of review, and we said, `In a commercial field, we can borrow the money at two per cent less than the banks; therefore, we can loan it out at two per cent less. We can choose our blue chip lendings.' Quite frankly, we thought that, if that was going to be to the detriment of the private banks, that was a criticism we would have to bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone in Australia&mdash;even our harshest critics&mdash;ever accused us of incompetence when it came to financial administration. Heaven only knows how we left the state in such good order, but we did it with our policy and philosophy. Polichronis threw that out completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the staggering part of the report. Interest rates were 20 per cent at that time. Polichronis advocated that we abolish all of the special loan funding arrangements via the QIDC special lending arrangements to people in trouble in small business or the farming sector. He said that that should be abolished and the interest rates should become 20 per cent. He got his way, even though it was over the broken backs of tens of thousands of Queensland small businessmen on the land and in the cities. That is what happened as a result of the Polichronis report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to heaven that the members who spoke before me knew something about the report or had read the report's foreword. They made mention of the fact that the Queensland government is in a very strong and sound financial way and its resources are in a marvellous way and, therefore, it should be allowed to run the bank in a right and proper manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous speakers on our side pointed out the ALP's record in running state banks. The State Bank of Victoria fell over, with a loss of $3,000 million. The South Australian State Bank broke that record and fell over with a loss of $3,100 million. I would have thought it would be the last thing on the planet that an ALP government would want to become involved in. But that is what is happening here today. The Queensland government is going into the field of banking. If you looked at Rothwells as a state bank&mdash;if I could be facetious and say that Rothwells was a state bank&mdash;you would see that it fell over, with a loss of $1,000 million, as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to whether these people are capable of running the financial administration of Queensland. Quite rightly,  the speakers from the government side said yesterday that the poverty report in Queensland was a 1990 report. It was a 1990 report. It would be very unfair to blame the present Queensland government for that 1990 report. So what did I do? I got the figures out and upgraded the report to find out whether or not the government in Queensland was culpable. I suspected that things were going all right in Queensland and the figures would not be as bad as the ones in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first statistics that I chose, naturally, were the figures for average weekly earnings. I found out that Queensland has by far and away the lowest average weekly earnings in the entire nation. In Queensland average weekly earnings are $496 a week, whereas for our two neighbours, the Northern Territory and New South Wales, average weekly earnings are $593 a week&mdash;almost $100 more in the Northern Territory, and almost $70 a week more in New South Wales, with $567. The only other state that was low was South Australia, with $522, which is still miles ahead of Queensland on $496 average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more worrying for Queensland is that it is the only state in Australia where average weekly earnings have fallen since 1993. So if the situation was bad in 1990, it is a lot worse now. Yet these are the people who are saying to us that they should be running a state bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, said that we on this side of the House do not take into account  investment in people. That was the expression she used. It is very unfortunate that she used that expression because investment in people comes down to education, for example. In Queensland we have the lowest retention rate in Australia, with the exception of South Australia, for people between 15 and 24 years of age&mdash;which is the education age, if you like. We have the lowest TAFE participation rate in Australia. Those two things come under the auspices of the state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland gross state product per head of mean population is the lowest in Australia, household disposable income is the lowest in Australia and its main income source is government benefits. We are the second highest in Australia there. Only South Australia has more people on the public purse in Australia. It pips us out there, but then Mr Bannon gave South Australia a great head start on us. I have already mentioned the mean total weekly earnings of all employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in every indicator that exists in Australian social trends, which one of the other ALP speakers was referring to as the social wage, Queensland is the worst in Australia bar two, and in both those cases we are slightly behind South Australia. In the other six we are well ahead of South Australia and are the worst in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the retention rates in schools go, every one of the speakers has said, `Queensland has had a massive increase in spending on education.' It has massively increased spending on education. </PARA>

There has been a massive increase in spending and it has a hell of a lot less people in schools. All I can say is, that demonstrates the state government's towering incompetence. Yet it is saying to us, `Give us control of the state bank.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not use the arguments about the social wage; the other side used the arguments about the social wage. If we come to health, which is part of the social wage, the Queensland government says, `We're good managers, we're spending more on health.' Yes, it is. There has been a massive increase in spending on health. But what is happening on the ground? This is a staggering statistic. I had enormous difficulty believing it. The Queensland government has cut the number of beds at the Townsville General Hospital, which is the biggest hospital north of Brisbane, from 540 to 360. Of course, if you cut the number of beds, the queues extend right out into the street and people die because they simply cannot get attention fast enough. </PARA>

But I do know that over 1,000 people in Mareeba, almost one-seventh of its population, turned up for a mass meeting after beds were removed from the Mareeba hospital, and that 230 people in Tully, about 10 per cent of its population, and 500 people in Charters Towers turned out for mass meetings because health services were being cut right across the board in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government massively increased spending on education, but there are 10 per cent fewer people in schools now than before. It massively increased spending on health, but fewer people now have beds than before. It has kicked all the people out into the streets. As for housing, each of the previous speakers said that there has been a massive increase in housing. But housing starts in Queensland are down 21 per cent. I would not trust Labor with a piggy bank, let alone a state bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just had some assistance from my very intelligent colleagues. This is not my chosen ground to fight on; the ALP chose to fight on its investment in people. Each of the speakers has said, `We've invested all this money.' They have, and they have invested it so toweringly incompetently that we have the lowest number of housing approvals in Australia. On the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, which is no great supporter of the government, it says `Lowest housing approvals in Australia: a dip of 21 per cent'. I agree with that. The government is spending more money on housing, education and health than it ever has before, and in each case it has a disastrous record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not hesitate to say that we looked to QIDC taking $2,000 million in lendings in Queensland. We were after blue-chip because we could get it. We could lend the money out at two per cent less than the money coming in. We could choose the sorts of people we wanted to lend to, and obviously housing was a very attractive area to us. The profits we got from that area would have been repatriated to help small business, which is staggering under the load imposed by the federal government, which took interest rates up over 20 per cent for the first time in Australian history and which took bankruptcies from 4,000 a year to 17,000 a year. At that time we were desperately trying to help these people in small business, whether they were in a town or on a farm, and we thought we could do that by taking the profit from the $2,000 million and repatriating it into this other area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the previous speakers referred to the disastrous mess that QIDC was in. When we handed QIDC over to the incoming Goss government, it had the lowest delinquency rate of any bank in Australia&mdash;and that is in the Polichronis report. Those opposite not only have not read the report but also have come in here and told flagrant untruths.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a delight to speak in the debate on the Banking (Queensland Industry Development Corporation) Amendment Bill after the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), because all the misrepresentations made by government members, who were allowed to go on with them, have been adequately answered by a person who was there, in the Queensland government, at the time and who obviously participated. The suggestion about extensive corruption being endemic in the National Party time and the reference to the QIDC are obviously ploys by them for the coming election. Premier Goss may now have some regrets that he allowed himself to call an election before this matter was debated in this House, because it does give us a full range to go across.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill itself is a simple one. In fact, it is just a few pages in length. The most significant part of the bill is the proposed amendment to section 5(1) of the Banking Act to include the Queensland Industry Development Corporation. That is the nub of the whole bill. What will this give the QIDC that it does not have now? If you look at the Reserve Bank and its supervisory powers&mdash;for a large part of the last 13 years the Treasury has been the responsibility of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as the Treasurer&mdash;you will see that the protection offered under the Banking Act is not as great as it seems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has already been made of what happened to other state banks, in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, under supervision. The member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) was a member of the banking committee inquiry into the banking system following deregulation. The massive incompetence in the supervision of those three enterprises, particularly the South Australian bank, is on the record and is quite evident. We also found during that inquiry that, while the QIDC was being operated by the Labor Queensland government, there was a lot the QIDC had to answer and account for. That was at the time of those high interest rates imposed by the Treasurer of the day, the present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well recall going to Charleville at that time and having it explained to us what the QIDC administration was doing for those people with rural loans and the manner in which it was trying to collect debts from people who were suffering from the vicious droughts and under those high interest rates. It is no panacea for the QIDC to be included in this bill, particularly if the record of the South Australian and the Victorian state banks is anything to go by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to sit here and listen to the earlier comments of the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. If we go back to the start of the QIDC in Queensland, we see that the opposition supported its formation. It was obviously a transitional stage. It was formed out of the Rural Reconstruction Board, and it also took up the Agricultural Bank facilities. Let us not be embarrassed about what the Agricultural Bank and the QIDC were set up to do. They were set up so that higher risk loans could be made to the people on the land. Those loans were made for a purpose. They were made for the development of the farming and grazing sectors of Queensland. The farming and grazing sectors still help out to a large extent the balance of trade. Advantages were also being given by the Commonwealth. The bank was set up to make sure the resources of Australia were strengthened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard of the repayment of the debt that the Labor government has been able to effect over the last six years. I can recall that the day the Queensland Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, arrived on the treasury bench the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>&mdash;not a friend of ours&mdash;was that the set of accounts handed over to the Labor government was the most competent of any legacy given to a Labor government in any state in Australia. That is on the record. It does not matter how much it is denied or how much that is corrupted by the government, that is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have referred to the repayment of the debt, I should say that the debt was created by providing resources through the Agricultural Bank and others to make the farming sector strong, provide us with powerhouses, railway electrification, mining ventures, roads, dams, weirs and water conservation. It is all those sorts of things that have made Queensland great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had a $4 billion dollar loan on that type of productive infrastructure, think in terms of what has happened since. We have a nil debt, apparently. But we do not have any major water conservation scheme. We have tolls being put on our roads. Our railways are to cease operating. Worst of all, we are now to buy power from New South Wales. We cannot produce enough power. Our resource is unemployed people. Our resource is a highly funded hospital system and education system and all the other systems catering to a lower degree of need or want than they were before. It seems strange to me that the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) comes in here to complain about these things when at the beginning of the year he was complaining about his own redistribution. If it looks as though things are not going his way he is the chief complainant. He said that Mr Longmans, the redistributor in Queensland, was biased and did not understand the principles of his act. So much for the member for Moreton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The QIDC was established initially to provide rural loans at reasonable risk rates and reasonable interest rates. When people criticise the board they must remember that the initial chairman, Graham Tucker, was a very competent person. He never saw eye to eye all the time with the Premier of the day but he was able to bring a degree of integrity to that bank which I believe has survived to this day. It is still providing a larger range of activities to the industry of Queensland than it did before and certainly at a higher rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the point: what are the activities of the bank? I want to mention, in particular, its activities in connection with rural reconstruction. Rural reconstruction was the activity of the old Agricultural Bank right back in the early days. It is important to understand that the bank will continue to be the distributor of these funds. While I have a lot of respect for some people working within the rural reconstruction area and the rural adjustment area, I believe that the QIDC and the government of Queensland are profiting by the fact that this money is not getting out as readily as it should to those people in grave need. Part of my electorate is now going through the fifth year of drought. I can speak for a lot of the rest of Queensland that is not getting the funds required to help these rural people, experienced people on the land with a future in front of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect of the reconstruction where there seems to be a deficiency&mdash;and I have heard this right throughout Queensland&mdash;is that the amount of funds to reconstruct farmers off the land and give them a place in a town or somewhere are only available if arrangements are made with the rural reconstruction area of the QIDC before the event of reconstructing that debt with the major lenders. This has not always been the case. We have seen many people thrown off their property because of the lack of security, because of the high interest rates, with nothing to go to. Any application after that date is not a viable turnout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did mention that the incorporation in 1986 of the QIDC was a move designed to assist, in particular, those people in rural Queensland. Since that time it has picked up many other aspects of help to industry, as the title suggests. In that period it has had a chequered history. There have been loan write-offs. We have heard the member for Kennedy say that in the time of the National Party government the write-off was the lowest of any of the banks throughout Australia. Since that time it has had massive write-offs of debt, particularly on high risk ventures. I mention Compass Airlines. I believe it lost on that. I am not sure whether it is putting money into the Indy participation on the Gold Coast, but obviously that is money that has gone too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there has not been that same history of accountability, in spite of what the Labor government says. Perhaps the supervision to be given by the Reserve Bank will assist in some way in ensuring that that risk factor is not as high as before. But I say again: don't count on it too much because many banks in Australia have failed even with that supervision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The eighth Accord comes after the successful seventh accord, which had an employment target of 500,000. We reached that target in two years and have now created 630,000 jobs since the time it was signed. This Accord shows that the Accord process of managing an economy&mdash;that is, not putting all the burden onto fiscal or monetary policy but having a third instrument such as wages&mdash;is the way that the Australian economy can best be operated and run in the context of a set of cooperative agreements between the government, the work force and the trade union movement of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to advise the House that the government has today agreed to and entered into its eighth accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sustaining growth, low inflation and fairness</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This accord is based on and consistent with maintaining an underlying rate of inflation of 2 to 3 per cent on average over the cycle.</PARA>
<PARA>It talks about the prospect of creating 600,000 jobs over the cycle of the agreement. It talks about the further extension of enterprise bargaining and the provision of an award safety net. It refers very specifically to the importance of putting a safety net under those people who cannot access the enterprise bargaining system. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Accord parties will support an approach to the AIRC to deliver three further annual adjustments of $9 to $12 per week available at the award level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For low paid workers, particularly those on award rates, this range will be $11 to $14 per week. This provides an element of redistributive support from the growth the economy is enjoying.</PARA>
<PARA>It is that very great change to a flexible enterprise bargaining based system of industrial relations underpinned by the equity of a safety net, which is the quite revolutionary way in which Australia has changed from a centralised wage fixing system to a system that guarantees economic efficiency and equity&mdash;and it guarantees it with low inflation.</PARA>

We have developed skills changes in the labour market, coming under the accord, through productivity, award restructuring and the education and training system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the production of a sustainable rate of economic growth with low inflation you would find that the government has engaged three policy instruments in the last 12 months: adjustments to monetary policy late last year, which were relatively small; adjustments to fiscal policy through a strong change to the budget balance, but one that protects the social wage through outlays; and, there is a lot of weight on the third instrument, the accord and wages. By spreading the weight over the three instruments and not over two we did not have to pull the monetary lever hard with a massive increase in interest rates and we did not have to cut government spending to pieces. We have seen the economy come back to 3.7 per cent economic growth and we have seen inflation remain at low levels.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, Accord Mark VIII has very significant and important implications for the government achieving its job target of five per cent unemployment or better by the year 2000. The government has been committed to the Working Nation initiatives, prior to this Accord, for achieving that target. It is interesting to observe that in Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> Ross Gittins, having talked about the things that are important to get unemployment down and also paying due regard to the initiatives under Working Nation, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, if all these things come together . . . we may come a lot closer to 5 per cent unemployment in 2000 than many people dare to hope.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a very important recognition by a significant economics writer that these are policies that are working. Today, Accord Mark VIII is another one of those significant things coming together. What Accord Mark VIII does is commit the parties, and the trade union movement in particular, to working with the government to achieve a minimum 600,000 new jobs over the life of the agreement. Another important dimension of the Accord is the way in which it describes the significance of achieving that five per cent target. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So important is the jobs target to the social and economic well-being of Australia, that the union movement agrees that wage claims will be assessed against satisfactory progress being made on the employment goal.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, not only is it an Accord that is important for jobs growth and the jobs target, but it is an Accord that is important to sensible wage outcomes and to low inflation. This is an Accord that, in terms of its 600,000 jobs, builds on the commitment in the previous accord&mdash;Accord Mark VII and its commitment to 500,000 jobs over three years. As has already been noted, we have achieved in excess of 600,000 jobs in two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has indicated that we will not hear much from the opposition about the Accord in relation to wages and jobs, but let us just recall what the former opposition spokesman on industrial relations, now the Leader of the Opposition, had to say when Accord Mark VII was handed down.</PARA>

<PARA>He was the Treasurer&mdash;and we:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">blew every recovery with a wage explosion. We did not really try decentralised wage fixing because we were in government.</PARA>
<PARA>He is engaged in conversation now. The quotes are a bit too hard for him. All of a sudden he gets interested and his puppeteer friends give him a question or have a conversation when the hard answers come back. He said, `We had a schizophrenic approach to wages policy.' That is from his own mouth&mdash;not claims by me. You can see it in his utterances&mdash;`Howard calls for cuts in real wages,' a delay to indexation. He opposed every wage increase, bar the last two safety nets. He supported $16 in 14 years. It is outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he talks about the wages of Australians. He wants a system where the no disadvantage test does not apply. That is the system he wants. He wants to turn Australians out of the wages system to a system where their meal allowances, overtime and penalty rates are no longer part of their wages. He wants to drive them back to award minimums and award minimums only. If workers move out of the wages system&mdash;and 1.6 million Australians change jobs&mdash;they lose all the award protections. He is going to gut the award system, and these people are going to come back into the system without protection and only under individual wage contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Howard is out there to butcher working Australians on their wages, just as he has always done. He has been the complete tory on all this. He has opposed all the wage increases. He is basically about ripping the low paid down. As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, what an objective! Here is an economy with an enormous strength and wealth. This year we have had four per cent growth&mdash;four per cent of $500 billion&mdash;and $20,000 million of extra wealth, but John Howard will not see someone on a $20,000 wage get a decent adjustment or protection under the awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a philosophy! What a view of life! He is saying, `Here I am. I've spent 20-odd years in parliament, and my main objective is to grind the low paid and those on modest incomes&mdash;under $30,000&mdash;out of the award protections and into a jungle of individual wage contracts.' As if the profit share in the economy is not high enough! As if you would need to drive it any higher by taking these reprisals against ordinary working people!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to answer the honourable member's question about Accord Mark VIII, the Accord that is so much in keeping with the totality of our IR reforms, and, I might say, the Accord that continues the process of encouraging federal award employees into the enterprise bargaining stream. In doing so, at the same time we maintain fairness and at the same time we maintain employee protection, the very hallmarks of our policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already under the framework established by the Industrial Relations Reform Act, we have seen some 60 per cent of all federal award workers covered by enterprise bargains&mdash;a figure more than double that achieved by any state system. At the same time we have achieved high economic growth; we have achieved record jobs growth; and we have done so at a time of industrial harmony, low inflation and wages moderation. It has been a fantastic outcome. Accord Mark VIII released today will maintain that. It will do so while delivering responsible safety net wage increases to the low paid and to all employees unable to secure enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of the House, I will just outline the five or six key elements of that Accord announced today: firstly, a strong emphasis on workplace bargaining underpinned by a comprehensive award safety net&mdash;the sort of award safety net that you would rip away; secondly, safety net adjustments from $9 to $14 to protect those unable to benefit from bargaining, particularly the low paid; thirdly, the maintenance of an effective and comprehensive award safety net&mdash;the award safety net those opposite would destroy&mdash;but also making it more understandable, user-friendly and relevant to the needs of enterprises and individual workplaces; fourthly, support for phased-in employee contributions to superannuation to coincide with safety net wage increases supplemented by employer and government contributions; and, finally, assistance to families and the encouragement of work practices that better balance work and family responsibilities. These are the key elements of Accord Mark VIII.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In combination, this Accord and the Industrial Relations Reform Act guarantee Australia's industrial harmony. They guarantee the continuity of the processes of decentralising our labour market, but they do so while maintaining all the vital protections required to give employees confidence as they move into the bargaining process. Together they deliver workplace change and productivity increases, but they ensure that employees get a fair share of the dividend. Whether it is through bargaining or through safety net adjustments, no-one under this system is left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition can deliver no such promises at all. All it can promise is the end of industrial peace, the end of wage moderation and the end of worker protection. That is what its policies stand for. The anti-worker policies that have been advanced by the member for Flinders and the Leader of the Opposition can only return us to the industrial chaos, the high unemployment and the inflation that we saw from them in the early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week the member for Flinders spoke about safety net adjustments, but there is never any detail about safety nets or any mechanism for how the coalition would adjust its existing policy. The coalition can guarantee only that workers will be worse off&mdash;because, as the Prime Minister said today, it stands for the abolition of the no-disadvantage test. That is one of the great fundamentals underpinning our whole system. It is a fundamental that you would remove. The very cornerstone of your policy is to remove the no-disadvantage test and to replace the award system with four miserly minimums: four weeks annual leave, two weeks non-cumulative sick leave, 12 months unpaid maternity leave and a minimum hourly wage&mdash;not even a minimum weekly wage. That is all we get from the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to workers' penalty rates, their leave loadings, their shift allowances, their overtime and their family leave&mdash;all these things are on the chopping block under the opposition's policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;and `they, the government, ought to be announcing some severe corrective measures which they will take to fix things up', and `what is absolutely clear now is that the government has been running a fiscal policy which is too loose and the OECD has made that point'. The fact is that the OECD made no such point. What the OECD said in its half-yearly economic outlook was that the forecasts for Australia were very similar to those the government has. They were slightly different at the margin because it was talking about calendar years, not financial years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But with that minor difference they essentially endorsed our forecast. What they said was that we would have economic growth in 1995 of 3.8 per cent and in 1996 of 3.5 per cent&mdash;no sign of an economic apocalypse there. What needs to be clearly understood is that those rates are quite high by the standards of other countries. In 1995 that rate of 3.8 per cent is the fifth highest of all Western developed countries, that is, there are only four other countries with a higher rate of growth expected in 1995. For 1996 we are the fourth highest, that is, there are only three others with a higher rate of growth forecast. So, far from saying this country is facing an economic apocalypse, the forecast of the OECD is that this country is going to grow with the very top rates of growth in the OECD this year and next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about employment growth? The forecast by the OECD for this year, 1995, is 2.8 per cent employment growth and for 1996 2.6 per cent. Again, these are relatively very high rates of employment growth&mdash;the equal third highest rate of employment growth in the whole of the Western developed world in 1995 and in 1996 the third highest. No sign of economic apocalypse there. The OECD expects the continuance of very good outcomes with relatively high rates of economic and employment growth. What the deputy opposition leader said yesterday was based on the fact that we had a forecast for the current account deficit by the OECD in 1995 of six per cent. That reflects the six per cent figure that is in the budget for 1994-95. So there is nothing new in that figure; it is just endorsing the figure that we had in our budget. Like us, the OECD forecasts that that current account number is going to come down. They say that in 1996 it will be 5.3 per cent. They do not see it getting worse; they see it coming down with the breaking of the drought and reduced growth in imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot be accused of being complacent about the current account. We have taken very substantial steps in this budget, as everyone in this House knows, to address the need to reduce the current account. We have done that by reducing the public sector dissaving through moving to budget surpluses and by the very important additional development built up under the Accord process, which we have talked about a lot today, to develop the new superannuation initiative, which will be an enormous boost to household and national savings in years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the opposition's position in respect of both of these major steps towards reducing the current account deficit? In relation to the budget opposition members are desperately trying to prevent the corrective measures that the government has announced and is trying to put in place being put through the parliament. They are opposing $1 1/2 billion worth of tax increases this year and $2.6 billion worth next year. So whilst we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition parading around saying that what this country needs is severe corrective measures he is doing his very best to stop the corrective measures in the budget from being put into place. What abundant hypocrisy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not stop at taxation, either. The opposition is also opposing expenditure cuts. We have already seen the opposition in this budget debate oppose the cuts in child care which limit the number of non-work related hours of child care to 12. They are saying that they will not support that; they are voting against that. That saves $150 million over the four years of the forward estimates. They are against expenditure cuts as well as increased taxes. So we have the broad `Oh, yes. Let us have severe corrective measures. There is a terrible problem.' But when it comes to dealing with individual measures, which this government has responsibly put before this parliament, to reduce the pressure on interest rates and to reduce the current account deficit, they are opposing them one by one. That is incredible hypocrisy and shows how shallow this opposition is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same goes for the superannuation initiatives. The opposition opposes them too. They are not in support of those initiatives to give a major boost to household and national savings. What we are seeing is an opposition opposing much of the measures that the government announced to ensure that the current account deficit is reduced and then calling for more severe corrective measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this economy needs the budget measures to be passed. The forecasts that are made by the OECD are a follow-on from its spelling out in that document of the budget measures&mdash;that is, in the broad, the move to surplus. On the basis of that it says this country will grow by almost four per cent in 1995, will be at the top level of the OECD and will have similar results on employment with those measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite try to take away those measures, they are simply sabotaging our efforts to produce good economic outcomes in this country. That is what is being done. Doing that and at the same time saying this country needs more severe corrective measures is just an extraordinary amount of abundant hypocrisy and it shows how abysmally unsuitable the opposition is to govern this country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the alleged interest of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kooyong in the interests of low income earners, let us see what they have to say about the new service which the honourable member for Chifley was kind enough to ask me about. Last November I advised the House that Telecom would be trialling a new service to make it easier for low income earners to get a telephone on at home. It is the government's view that, with telephone carriers investing billions of dollars in cable and with telephone companies investing large sums of money in improving the mobile telephone service around the country, we think the least they can do is also make it easier for the one million Australians who do not have a phone on at home by bringing in this service as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the chief executive of Telstra, Frank Blount, and I launched this new service, which is called InContact. It will allow households to receive calls and to ring the 000 emergency number. InContact will be provided with no rental, connection or service charges. However, where there is not an existing telephone line there will be a connection fee. But the good news is that, in the 20 of per cent of cases where Telecom estimates there will be a need for some cabling to be done, people will have that credited against the normal connection fee if customers subsequently upgrade to the standard telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, as you would know, this service has been trialled in Wollongong. The feedback suggests people who are looking for work find it easier because they can leave a contact number with prospective employers, and people believed they were safer and more secure knowing they could contact the emergency services number, especially those with young children and especially the elderly and retirees. Also, families and friends were more confident that they could ring to check people were safe, and children found it easier to ring their parents to let them know where they were or that they were safe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the launch yesterday, Gwen George from the Older Women's Network made a point about how important the telephone service is for elderly Australians in particular. She gave examples of where people do not buy food because they know how important it is to maintain that telephone contact. We have had support from the Telecom Australia Consumer Council including the Smith Family and ACOSS, and The Pensioner and Superannuation Federation; who said that this is a great new initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one lone voice across the Commonwealth saying he was against this new service. It was the voice of the spokesman for the Liberal Party on communications, Senator Alston. In Senator Alston's press release yesterday he said that `this new service was a limited and short-term solution'. So it is the view of the Liberal Party that it is a limited and short-term option to help people who are looking for work be able to leave a contact number with prospective employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the view of the Liberal Party that it is a limited and short-term solution to let pensioners and isolated families be able to ring the 000 emergency services number. It is the view of the official Liberal Party spokesman that it is a limited and short-term solution to allow families and friends to be able to contact relatives at night; they would rather force them out of their homes to use the public telephone boxes. That being the official view, which was expressed by the Liberal Party spokesman on communications, I think we are entitled to know: is that also the view of the Leader of the Opposition?

I can certainly tell this House that all of the feedback from the people in Wollongong has been that they think it is a great service for them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way and the new owners of Telecom included substantial shareholdings by foreign telephone companies, we would then be entitled to ask: how would the Leader of the Opposition guarantee that those foreign telephone companies would maintain the services in rural and regional Australia? How could the Leader of the Opposition assure the member for Parkes that the foreign telephone companies would not cut back the services in Broken Hill? How could he assure people that services would not be cut back in Mackay or in other National Party electorates?

Its claim is that `the government has consistently maintained that unless a farm is in exceptional circumstances, students from farm families do not qualify for Austudy'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect that the member for Maranoa is an accomplice in this. It is a pity he will not be here to hear the rest of the answer. For farmers, the value of the home and curtilage of up to two hectares is also a deductible item. The United Grazier Association refers in its letter to exceptional circumstances. What it is talking about are areas declared as drought affected special circumstances. In those areas no assets test applies at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the latest ABARE statistics, the average net equity which the owner holds in broadacre farms in Australia, given over to mixtures of livestock and crops, is $663,630. That is below the Austudy assets test threshold, even without deducting the value of the house and the surrounding land. For wheat and for other crop farms the ABARE figures show the average net value of about $790,000, which is about $40,000 over the assets limit. But, when you deduct the value of the house and curtilage, again it comes below the threshold. For sheep and beef farms pretty much the same applies. The average equity is $790,000. For sheep properties the average net value is $707,000, which is again within the assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the average farming family is not disqualified under the Austudy assets test. Of the 208 farms valued by the Australian Valuation Office in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia for Austudy purposes in 1993-94, only 33 were over the limit in gross value. More than five farm families in six had no difficulty qualifying under the assets test. Apart from that, there is the drought assistance package which I mentioned which provides a safety net for those in special circumstances. The Australian Valuation Office will provide valuations where weather or market conditions have forced the value of a property down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that farming families can apply for Austudy at any time during the year if their assets fall below the threshold. I would ask all honourable members, particularly those members of the National Party, including the member for Maranoa, to disown the claims of the UGA. Telling farmers that they should not apply for assistance is quite wrong.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that earlier today Senator Evans told the Senate that he had written to French Prime Minister Juppe after the election of President Chirac indicating Australia's opposition to nuclear testing but that Senator Evans refused to table the letter? Is the Prime Minister aware that subsequently today Senator Evans has revealed that in his letter to Prime Minister Juppe he did not make any direct representation whatsoever concerning French nuclear testing but simply congratulated him on his appointment? Is it not now obvious that the government wanted to hide Senator Evans's letter to the French Prime Minister because that letter is proof that from the time of the election of President Chirac the government has taken a soft and weak stand on the issue of French nuclear testing?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The moment the announcement was made by President Chirac on 14 June I immediately issued a statement deploring the decision. Defence activities were frozen until the cessation of French testing, visits by French military aircraft or vessels, except those relating to humanitarian or surveillance activities which benefit South Pacific countries, were denied and the transits which, in any way, supported the testing program were forbidden. I foreshadowed contact with Pacific leaders. On the same day, the acting foreign minister, Senator McMullan, called in the French ambassador and issued a formal protest. Our ambassador made similar protests in Paris.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 June, I issued a statement on behalf of my South Pacific colleagues condemning the French decision and announcing that a delegation from the forum would go immediately to France. On 15 and 16 June, Australian representatives at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and the UN in New York took action to protest the French decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 June, I moved a motion in this House condemning the decision. On 20 June, Australian time, the foreign minister, acting as leader of the forum delegation, conveyed to French foreign minister de Charette the strong opposition of forum countries to the decision. On the same day, I sent an immediate report on the results of the delegation meeting to other forum heads of government and asked them to consider what further steps the region might take to reinforce our concern about the French decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans returned to Australia last night. He and I had a discussion upon his return. The government, as we have said all along, will now consider the report from Senator Evans and what further steps might be taken to register our opposition. We have begun receiving responses from our partners in the South Pacific. We look forward to their replies and being in a position to announce some coordinated regional responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that on those issues the government's position has been a very strong one. Let me say this also the government of France: the decision taken by the government of France is no deterrent against the greatest nuclear threats now facing Europe and the world&mdash;that is, the emergence of new nuclear weapon states, the rotting carcasses of old Soviet reactors in eastern Europe, stockpiles of degrading nuclear weapons and weapons systems and contaminated nuclear sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth reminding the House there are 21 Chernobyl type RBMK reactors, which are considered to have an inherent design fault, operating in Russia, Lithuania and the Ukraine. When I saw Prime Minister Balladur in France over a year or so ago, he said to me that one of the great concerns facing his government and Europe is the state of the 21 Chernobyl type reactors that are sitting in Russia, Lithuania and the Ukraine. We have seen already the damage that came from Chernobyl.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could you imagine if there were any further reactor failures of the kind we saw spread across 21 reactors which have to be, over time, replaced? If the government of France wants to worry about the protection of its people, it needs to worry about a nuclear cloud over Europe, threatening a civilisation of people, which can come in a very real way from the design fault and collapse of this reactor system in Russia, Lithuania and the Ukraine.

The worst current account deficit recorded during that period was minus 4.8 per cent of GDP. During that year, five other nations in the OECD area recorded worse current account deficits. That was the first piece of deception on the part of the Prime Minister. The second was when he quoted from the doorstop I gave in Queensland last week regarding French nuclear tests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am out of horses. Whilst the Prime Minister's performance has its usual entertainment value, you would have to say that, in a way, it is a very sad reflection on the state of public debate in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you think about it, the history of economic management in recent years for a lot of Australians has been no laughing matter. It was again a classic, I thought, that the two principal operators for the labour movement in this country&mdash;the Prime Minister of a Labor government and the head of the ACTU&mdash;should appear on television to announce the latest political deal that they have done. The perception they were creating was one of Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with the word in tablets of stone. Yet the reality is a very different one for many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the accord is not an instrument for constructive economic reform to provide benefits to the average working Australians, but a political deal to foster the political position of this government and to keep this government in office. It would be a good thing if an accord were directed to genuine economic reforms but, sadly, after 12 years of this government that has not been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the history of a few of the accords. The accord arose out of Bob Hawke's win back in 1983 when Labor came into office. That accord saw the government go on a spending spree, the like of which we had not seen since Whitlam. It led to massive demand pressures in the Australian economy and, as has happened on so many occasions in Australian economic history, it basically blew out the current account deficit and led to the current Prime Minister announcing that Australia was on the path to a banana republic and to the economic policy of the following few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the only example of the accord I would remind the House of. The 1989 accord was a classic in itself. The 1989 accord included some significant tax increases. That fed into demand. Again, as has so often happened, that led to a blow-out of the current account deficit. Whilst promising as the government went into the 1990 election that we were going to have a soft landing, the government so jacked up interest rates that it brought on the worst recession in this country's history since the Great Depression of the 1930s. So much for the accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All through this period we have had promises of better economic management but in reality a different picture. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) said, as Australia attempts to go past a growth rate of about three per cent, we always, given the current structure of this economy, blow the current account deficit. In 1983, ours was the fifth worst in the OECD; in 1984, it was the fourth worst in the OECD; in 1985, it was the third worst in the OECD; by 1994, it was the worst in the OECD except for Mexico; and, in 1995, we finally get to the top of the tree&mdash;we are worse than all in the OECD, including Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting reflection to go back to one of the few times the Prime Minister has ever really told the Australian public the truth about the Australian economy. It was on 14 May 1986 that he said that we were heading towards a banana republic. If we are to give those many hundreds of thousands of Australians who today are unemployed the real chance of a job as we go through to the year 2000, we will have to do a hell of a lot better than three per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last year the Prime Minister said that if you could not do four per cent then you ought to get out of the business. When he is asked that question, he always fudges the answer. People say to him, `We are not at four per cent now. So are we not matching your own criteria for your continued stay as Prime Minister?' He says, `Oh, well, we are near four per cent: we are 3.25; we are 3.75.' The fact is that we are nowhere near four per cent. We are moving away from four per cent. The prospect is not of more jobs in the future but of fewer jobs, particularly of full-time jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look not only at the current account deficit situation, you see that the underlying nub of this debate is whether or not Australia can achieve the gains in efficiency in the way in which we run our economy so that the average Australian family can enjoy a higher standard of living. If you look at labour productivity in Australia&mdash;I do not have the figures for the last two or three years&mdash;the labour productivity figures have picked up during the recession, which is a cyclical effect. But, if you take the figures from 1985 to 1991, the latest OECD figures which are available&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Brereton interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that if you like, if time permits. Give me an extension of time, Minister, and I will give you a real burst and give you something to answer, instead of the usual rhetoric we have from you. Over that six-year period on only one occasion did Australia do better on labour productivity than our OECD trading partners. People should ask themselves: after 12 years of Labor, am I any better off? The answer is no. They are not better off because those opposite oppose the sorts of changes that would make our economy a far more efficient place and that would give people real prospects for increases in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should ask themselves: why it is that we have a poor productivity result? They do not have to take the opposition's view on this; they can take the latest OECD economic survey on Australia. The language the OECD uses is sort of Byzantine, polite, indirect and very often constrained, but its message on the labour market is crystal clear. The OECD report says that the industrial relations system still remains very complex and highly prescriptive. It says that our industrial relations reforms generated considerable confusion about the role of the commission and unions, and that, as a result, the negotiation of enterprise agreements is time consuming and costly. The OECD report says that it was questionable `whether awards are best suited to perform a safety net function' and that the complexity of the safety net structure constrains `the capacity of the labour force to adjust to change'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the change we want, Minister. You stand here and say you are moving us in the direction of that change, but the OECD report&mdash;it is very informative; only a short read, but well worth reading&mdash;notes that the government's rhetoric on enterprise bargaining goes back to 1987 and that even the changes made in 1988-89 were cumbersome, too complex and unable to achieve the productivity benefits that we need. So you have been talking about these things for years and years, but the Australian people have suffered as a result of your failure to get the productivity gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the accord process on individuals again is not a happy picture. Real average weekly earnings, for example, have fallen by 0.4 per cent. If you look at the nature of our society&mdash;whether it is a fairer and a better place&mdash;you will see that the distribution of income, even allowing for the social wage, has become less equal. Basically, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer under you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have suffered the worst recession for 60 years. Our current account deficit, as I have mentioned, is now worse even than Mexico's and worse than those of the OECD. We have had record numbers of bankruptcies and small business failures. There are also the social implications, including the impact on Australian marriages and the impact on young people&mdash;the high suicide rates and the absolutely disgraceful high youth unemployment rate we have in this country. It is a disgrace, Minister. We have a society with all the riches and a good democracy, but 25 per cent of our young people cannot get a job. Why is that? It is because of the constraining, rigid, inflexible policy that you have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accord process over the last 12 years has a very poor record at the economy level, the macro level and with its impact on individuals. I ask anybody listening to this: how have the accord and the government's economic policy affected you in the last 12 years? After the last 12 or 13 years of Labor, are you and your family better off? It is not a politically generated question. I think most people would say they are not better off. The truth is that in that time a lot of people have lost their businesses and the opportunities they otherwise would have been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then those opposite have the gall to front up, as they did to the Australian people, and attempt to be the incarnation of traditional Australian values. We had plausible Martin Ferguson saying he represents workers. He does not represent workers; he represents a minority of workers and, furthermore, the minority of workers he has are deserting him in droves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are so desperate for members that one union in Sydney last year advertised discount strippers to attract more members. That is how low your union mates have gone. Instead of fronting up with Martin Ferguson, the Prime Minister would have presented a more accurate picture if he had turned up with his shadowy troika including George Campbell. He is the one with 100,000 scalps on his belt from the 1980-81 gross campaign they waged, which cost a lot of people their jobs. George Campbell is the bloke who knocked off Bruce Childs to come in here and be the Prime Minister's lackey in the upper house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The troika would include that bloke Coombs from the Maritime Union, the doyen of the aristocracy of the working class&mdash;the bloke whose members, generally speaking, earn three times what the average Australian earns and the bloke who has done more to retard, with your acquiescence, Minister, decent workplace reform on our waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last one I would throw in would be Bill Ludwig&mdash;your mate from Queensland&mdash;who is the man who provides the factional clout to keep Wayne Goss in power, and Keating and Brereton, with their numbers in Queensland. When you look behind these operators, he is the man, far from supporting the average battler, who is actually raiding the battlers in his own organisation because he has a request out to his own organisers that they surrender their long service leave entitlements&mdash;a pool of funds of about $3 million&mdash;to the union to pay for the mismanagement of the AWU by Bill Ludwig and people. </PARA>

Yet the member for Flinders has walked into the House and said, `Oh, no, the Accord is not an instrument of constructive economic reform.' This is the Accord that gave us Medicare. This is the Accord that stabilised the economy. This is the Accord that repaired the social wage. This is the Accord that gave the Australian economy productivity, that gave us skill enhancement.

He has a document that has about as much credibility as the Hitler diaries. Jobsback was drafted by a man whose record is irrevocably tarnished by the wages blowout of the early 1980s. It is a rerun of the Victorian model that has led to the great exodus of workers from the Victorian IR system. More than half a million  workers have flooded into the Commonwealth system, the national system. That has left its architect, Phil Gude, a national IR joke. That is Jobsback.

I'm for the families,' when he wants to tear away the award system that is so central to protecting the very interests of families and so absolutely fundamental to protecting the interests of the battlers in the community?

It is going to be even harder to rationalise it when your Jobsback policies have failed so dismally in so many of your own conservative states.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the worst recession for 60 years. Let me stress to the minister that, during that recessional period, we had four of those eight accords. So they were not very successful and I doubt whether this eighth one will be any better. We had record bankruptcies among small business. We had unemployment rocket to one million people out of work&mdash;800,000 of whom are still out of work&mdash;the highest in the nation's history. Now we have a massive balance of payments crisis which, according to reports this week, puts us in the same league as Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the workers themselves do not have any confidence in the government? Is it any wonder that the workers doubt the credibility of the ACTU? One has only to look at the dramatic fall in trade union membership for evidence of this loss of faith. ABS statistics between August 1988 and August 1994 show that trade union membership dropped seven per cent to 35 per cent of Australia's 6.5 million employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's Accord Mark VIII agreement has been framed with tomorrow morning's newspaper headlines in mind. But the hundreds of thousands of ordinary workers around the country will be saying tomorrow morning, `Here we go again.' It is more smooth talk from Keating and Ferguson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question they are asking is: what is it going to do for me? This is the sort of question I get asked every day as I move around my electorate and talk to small business operators, shop keepers, factory employees, trades people and young people. I get asked: why can I not get a job; why am I not getting ahead; and why am I little better off than being on the dole? If they are in small business they ask: why is government taking more and more off me the harder I work? These questions are not being addressed by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to the case of Mr Peter Hajenko who is a public servant in my electorate. He is a very focused and hardworking man with four teenage children. He is married and his wife does not work. Mr Hajenko's gross income is $34,600 a year. One of his teenagers has reduced Austudy and another is on an unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After allowing for the basic family payment, the home child-care allowance and deductions for superannuation, the family nets $1,146 per fortnight. If he had exactly the same family circumstances but was unemployed&mdash;and I am assuming $100 per week in casual employment&mdash;the family would earn $1,272  per fortnight. That is a difference of $126 per fortnight. Where is the equity? Where is the incentive for battling Australian families to get ahead?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that on the day of this new Accord, in the local Bundaberg newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News Mail</EMPHASIS>, Mr Hajenko's story has been told under the headline, `Average working families ignored'. Mr Hajenko is quoted in that article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am just very concerned that the government is not honouring its commitments to the working families of the country and I was under a false impression that those who work get some reward for their labour.</PARA>

Yet unemployment remains a critical issue in regional Australia. I will take you on a trip up the Queensland coast. In my electorate of Hinkler in Central Queensland, one in every three teenagers looking for work cannot get a job. That situation extends from the Sunshine Coast to Ingham. In the Wide Bay-Burnett region, the southern part of my electorate, the figure is closer to 40 per cent. </PARA>

The facts are that this government does not have the answers and its inability to perform even permeates Working Nation&mdash;the government's big attack on unemployment&mdash;which is clearly faltering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statistical decline in long-term unemployment since Working Nation is largely a government inspired mirage. It has more to do with the government redefining 70,000 long-term unemployed as short-term unemployed after putting them through a labour market program. In other words, if you keep them going through labour market programs, you can say that they are no longer long-term unemployed. What a hopeless fraud. Commencements in jobstart, the government's most successful labour market program&mdash;I do not knock it, but those opposite boom it up with rhetoric&mdash;in the first six months of Working Nation collapsed to 30,000 fewer than in the same period the previous year. Commencements in other programs have also fallen well behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment figures are further fudged by redefining certain groups of unemployed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the coalition does not like the accord. It hates the idea that it has been successfully renewed seven times, including today's historic Accord Mark VIII. At the end of the day, the coalition does not like trade unions. It does not like talking to trade unionists. It does not like consulting with Australian working people. It does not like the idea of the Australian work force having a legitimate say in the way in which this nation and its economy are managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only Labor has demonstrated the unity and purpose of political and industrial labour to put together a sophisticated economic and industrial model. This has been the historic transformation. The MPI seeks to talk about industrial relations reform. There has been a bucket load of it in the last decade. Only under Labor has the nation made the historic transformation&mdash;80 years of centralised industrial relations out of the court in Melbourne&mdash;to a flexible, workable, cooperative industrial relations environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it had been the Liberal Party and the National Party, spearheaded by the member for Goldstein, attempting that task over the last 10 years, what would have happened? We would have had the jackboots style of the H.R. Nicholls Society. We would have had legislation drafted by the wordsmiths at the H.R. Nicholls Society with the member for Goldstein scribbling away. He would not be able to scribble the words down fast enough, as John Stone, Judith Sloan and the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) put the jackboots on and try to deregulate the Australian industrial relations system through confrontation and disputation. That would have been the inevitable result. There would not have been a single productivity improvement. We would have seen the closing down of Australian industry through confrontation and disputation&mdash;strike after strike after strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only under Labor have we seen 4,500 enterprise agreements formalised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;60 per cent of federal award workers under an enterprise bargain.

Only Labor has the sophisticated model of IR flexibility, the genuine enterprise bargaining, the productivity focus, the low disputation and low strike rate around Australia and, in the end, low inflation and wage restraint because workers know the relationship between wages and productivity. It is not 45 per cent productivity with the member for Wills and that authoritarian, extreme Left, Albanian style of industrial relations. Instead, it is the sort of approach that produces gains in cooperation with the trade union movement and produces employment growth. There have been 600,000 new jobs since the last election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the adjournment debate this evening, honourable members may be surprised that I will speak not on Jeffrey Kennett but on a constituent of mine, Mr Maurice Brumer. Maurice is a qualified second generation optometrist who has had continuous sole practice in Frankston for over 25 years. He is actively campaigning on behalf of children who, through no fault of their own, are condemned to a life of reading difficulties and early departure from the education system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maurice has been punished for raising concerns about current standards of optometrical practice and the need to better incorporate findings of research into current modes of practice. In a paper entitled `Optometry: light of a perverted science', he initiated a discussion on the issue of spectacles being a harmful drug when not prescribed properly. He canvassed a number of matters relating to prolonged and intensive near-seeing, which he believes is not good for our eyes and our health. He firmly stated that the public has a right to know how glasses may adversely affect good health. Maurice made the point that he did not think this would happen while the optometry profession put the public interest in second place to its own self-interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For his efforts, Maurice Brumer was expelled from the Victorian division of the Australian Optometrical Association, a first in history. He dared challenge the cabal that rules optometry in Victoria when he spoke out at a 1992 annual meeting of the Victoria AOA and the national AOA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extensive body of theoretical and clinical evidence already exists to show the harmful effects of current optometrical practices. The analogy could be made to tobacco companies, where no amount of research and evidence will convince them of the health related problems of smoking and to the scandal it would be if they could successfully suppress such evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the belief that the burden of proof lies with the profession to show that its current standards of practices are in the best interests of its patients, Maurice presented a paper before 400 optometrists. The only response since was for the Australian Optometrical Association to make him the first member ever expelled from the association. The Australian Optometrical Association rigidly enforces the code that the first obligation of the optometrist is to his professional colleagues. Maurice insists it is to his patients. </PARA>

It goes like this: what do the following all have in common&mdash;the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission now located in Sydney, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal now located in Brisbane, the Industry Commission now located in Melbourne, Australian Defence Industries now located in Sydney, the Australia Post national stamp collection now located in Melbourne and the CSIRO headquarters now located in Melbourne?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They all used to be Public Service bodies located in Canberra, and it is this Labor government that has moved these bodies and staff out of Canberra. If the government had had its way, it would have done more. It would have moved the Maritime Safety Authority to Newcastle, but it backed down under intense pressure. It was the federal Labor government that voted for the Australian National Training Authority to go to Brisbane rather than to the ACT. It was this government that suggested the transfer of the Australian Broadcasting Authority to Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet it is this government, through Senator McMullan, that is attempting to ridicule the coalition and wrongly and incorrectly say that the coalition will move departments and public servants out of the Australian Capital Territory, when it is those members opposite who have been doing the moving. They are hypocrites. There must be an election in the air!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, the Labor Party trots out the old chestnut that it is the coalition that slashes the Public Service. Let us look at the government's recent record. The front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 11 May 1995 says `Budget `95: The Aftermath: Many to be out of job, says Johns'. The government should come clean. When will it say how many jobs will be lost in the federal Public Service through its budget? What hypocrites and deceivers government members are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the figures for last year. In 1993 there were 143,100 permanent public servants employed under the Public Service Act. A year later, in December 1994, there were only 132,500 left. If it is not the Labor Party slashing the Public Service, then who is it? Admittedly, some of those public servants moved across to the Australian Capital Territory health department, but it is about time Senator McMullan came clean on what his party is doing to the Public Service instead of trotting out old lies and deceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan said in a press release that I should stand up for Canberra. Perhaps he should have listened to my maiden speech. Perhaps he should practise what he preaches. I have written to the responsible minister, the foot-in-mouth member for Petrie (Mr Johns), and asked about his comment that large numbers of public servants would be out of a job after the 9 May budget. I am yet to get an answer. Perhaps Senator McMullan, as a representative in Canberra, could hurry him up and get an answer for all Canberrans and all Australians about their Public Service. While he is at it, he might ask the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) when the promised Lake George upgrade will begin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go a step further. What about the jewel in the crown of the government's cultural policy in the lead-up to the 1993 election? `We will build a National Museum of Australia,' it said. Here we are in 1995, another election in the air, and do the people of Australia have a museum? No. Are the numbers of public servants who will be employed at the National Museum of Australia growing? No. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a promise, which has been made several times, that the coalition will fulfil: we will build a National Museum of Australia at Yarramundi Reach here in the ACT and there will be public servants employed at it. Unlike the Labor Party, which is full of deceivers and tellers of half-truths who pull out chestnuts before every election just to bolster their own aims and to scare ordinary Australians, the coalition, when we are elected, will build the National Museum of Australia and we will staff it with public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time the old myth that the Public Service and the Liberal Party have no affinity with each other is put to rest. I am proud to say that during the Canberra by-election&mdash;a by-election at which I must admit John Howard was more than welcome to attend, unlike the Prime Minister who will not be going to Queensland&mdash;John Howard made it abundantly clear that the Liberal Party has never been philosophically anti-Public Service. Indeed, we will have an effective and efficient Public Service&mdash;unlike under the Labor government&mdash;that will allow us to put in place our party's policies and to build a better Australia. </PARA>

My father has been working in that area since 1949 and so have a lot of other people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I wish to speak about something positive in my electorate. You will recall that I have stood up in this House on a number of occasions and given the House and the parliament progress in the building, timber and forestry industries in my area. It is a subject that many walk away from because they find the difficulties in the industry beyond their comprehension or because their ability to do something is limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, you will remember, I became involved virtually the week after I was elected because there was a resource called water being pushed out into the ocean in ocean outfalls. In fact, there was a rather outrageous proposal being put forward by the local council, the Shoalhaven City Council, to try to propagate ocean outfalls. After a long time, and after a number of public debates with the mayor and others, it was resolved that, with the help of DEET, we would go through and have a look at ways employment might be generated by the use of that water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surprise, surprise! The Shoalhaven City Council is now having problems allocating the water equitably among farmers. My dreams of it being used in the forestry industry will not come to fruition. That is not because of my lack of trying, but because more profitable uses for that water have come to the surface. In fact, there have been people who have contacted the council and said, `If you drought-proof us, we will bring large amounts of money to your area and spend it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not give up. Over the last two years, we have been looking at other ways we can go about it. True, the corporate structure I had envisaged, of the council, the landowner and the timber industry components putting in an effluent management scheme which had a capital component built in behind it, may not eventuate in the near future. However, there is a team from the government working in my electorate, headed by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), Senator Faulkner and Senator Cook. Because of that team effort I am in a position where I have agreement, in principle, from a number of business people in the timber industry to form a holding company, which will aim to bring together production from some 30,000 hectares of plantations over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people joining with the landowners will benefit the forestry industry, which was once the backbone of the industry along our section of the coast, Mr Speaker, stretching from your beautiful electorate of Cunningham down to the electorate of the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). You would recall the red cedar from Kiama that adorns the Sydney Town Hall. That timber, the internals of Kiama, is spread out in those benches. Much of the timber from the Wollongong and Illawarra areas adorns Parliament House in Macquarie Street in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us have looked at the industry. We have seen the cleared lands. We have seen that the agricultural use after clearing is not outstandingly successful in terms of profits and attractions of the area. However, the dairy industry is one of those industries which are an exception. It has brought great wealth to our area and has been the mainstay of our area for a large number of years. It will continue to be so, despite the efforts of some, such as my former aldermanic opponent, Neville Fredericks, to try to urbanise those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry will survive because it is able to diversify. The timber industry offers the dairy industry a way of keeping its lifestyle and a way of keeping its land together, and, by doing that, a way of improving the agricultural output of the dairy industry and its own productive units. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House a situation that I find quite extraordinary and a matter that must be addressed by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) as a matter of urgency. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee has made a decision that pethidine for long-term use is no longer available under the national health scheme and, despite the matter being reviewed some two weeks ago, the decision has been confirmed. The PBAC has displayed what I would consider to be a mixture of gross ignorance and unsubstantiated assumption that cannot in any way be condoned by the Australian community or many of Australia's doctors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background: this situation came to my attention via a local constituent and her doctor. If the opportunity presents itself I will read the letter from the doctor which clearly sets out the position and shows the advisory committee's total lack of compassion. It seems extraordinary to both me and my patient's treating doctor that he can prescribe morphine or methadone for long-term use and this apparently is condoned by the PBAC as acceptable, but not so for pethidine. There is absolutely no reason why pethidine should be treated any differently, and I find it absolutely galling that the committee can make a unilateral decision without having any awareness of the likely impact of that decision on the individual patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that my constituent has undergone specialist examination, has attended pain clinics and has done everything that would reasonably be expected of someone in her position suffering from chronic pain. It is about time that the committee accepted that there will be people severely affected by its decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is equally galling is that the basis for the committee's decision is that it believes the use of pethidine long term is `inappropriate treatment'. As far as my constituent and her doctor are concerned, the treatment by way of long-term pethidine prescription is totally appropriate treatment and I fail to see how the committee can make such a widespread value judgment without in any way taking into account individual circumstances. The other galling aspect is that, relative to other drugs, pethidine is extremely cheap and, therefore, there can be no financial reason for the advisory committee's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am angry about this decision. My constituent and her doctor are angry about this decision. I understand that many doctors throughout Australia are angered by this decision. If, as I believe may be the situation, the committee has made this decision on the views of one member of the committee, can I respectfully suggest that all committee members take a long, hard look at that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to reading out that letter from my constituent's treating doctor, I would like to make a final comment, and that is: how dare the advisory committee presume to know more about a patient's appropriate treatment than the patient's treating doctor. The letter from my constituent's treating doctor reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This pleasant woman suffers chronic pain due to having developed an arachnoiditis, i.e. inflammation surrounding the spinal cord. There is no cure and essentially she will probably become paralysed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately she has a very low tolerance to opiates, i.e. morphine and methadone. These cause her severe nausea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The one drug that did assist her was pethidine in injectable form and used once daily in combination with other therapeutic agents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately pethidine (injectable) is no longer available for long term use on the N.H.S. Scheme, and any attempt to prescribe them in this manner would be questioned by the Health Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She does use pethidine tablets but these are largely ineffectual and of course she has to pay for these at the rate of $36.00 per hundred tablets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She requires a minimum of six fifty mgm tablets daily which really do not give her effective relief. Apart from this there is the cost to her as a Pensioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it possible to get through you permission to prescribe pethidine injectable for this woman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the life of me, I cannot see why pethidine is only allowed for short term use only, when I can prescribe other opiates freely!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Procedure Committee's report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review: Bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>, was tabled in the main chamber on Monday of this week. The very fact that we now have, within that same week, the opportunity in this chamber to consider some of the elements of that report in greater detail than would have been available to us in the main chamber attests, probably as well as anything, to the very effective way in which the Main Committee has operated since its introduction last year. That was one of the main changes which came about in the procedures of the House of Representatives, following the Procedure Committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report, which was tabled by Dr Blewett, my predecessor as the chair of this committee, in October 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present report which the Procedure Committee has had tabled in the House of Representatives is the third report of the Procedure Committee to the 37th parliament. In view of the wide ranging nature of the proposals in the first report, the committee felt very strongly that, after a settling-in period, the new procedures should be reviewed to see how they were working and whether any modifications needed to be built into them, whether any of them should have in effect been withdrawn from operation, and whether they should have been supplemented in any way. In November last year, the Procedure Committee wrote to all members and to anyone who was involved in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> inquiry, seeking their comments on the new procedures, and the committee is very much indebted to all of those who made submissions. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review</EMPHASIS> report follows a similar structure to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report, to enable readers to refer from one report to the other more easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay a special compliment and provide special thanks to Robyn Webber and James Rees. Robyn acted as the secretary of the committee, and James assisted her and assisted the committee, and they both continue to do that. I not only want to refer especially to the professional interest which both Robyn and James have in questions of procedure because of their vocational involvement in those areas, but I also want to emphasise the personal interest which they have, quite apart from their professional responsibilities. Their knowledge of some of the more technical intricacies of procedures was of great value to the committee in advising us, and their drafting skills were of exceptional importance and of very great value to the committee in being able to bring forward this report. So I proffer thanks to both Robyn and James for their assistance, cooperation and contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unquestionably, the introduction of the Main Committee would have been the most important consideration in that initial report, and it has been outstandingly successful. Members have related to it very well, as it is a much more intimate chamber than the main chamber. There probably would have been value in having this place referred to not as the Main Committee but as the Second Chamber. It was an objective of the Procedure Committee to seek to establish an alternative debating forum which would have a status equal, as closely as possible, to that of the main chamber. It has been called the Main Committee, and that title is almost certain to persist, but we should, as often as we can, think in terms of its being a second chamber to the main chamber, with a status as close as possible to the status of the main chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to emphasise that the report is truly a bipartisan effort as far as the committee is concerned. I particularly want to thank the deputy chair of the committee, the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who will be participating in this debate. When we are dealing with procedures of the parliament, which are obviously of great importance to how governments and oppositions perform in the parliament and how their performance is perceived&mdash;not only within this institution but in that wider institution the national community&mdash;it is often very difficult to come to a common position on some of the issues. In fact, that was often the case in reviewing that report and the new procedures. But I say to members of the opposition, and to my own colleagues, that the goodwill which they brought to that process reflected very great credit on their commitment to this institution and the important role they saw it fulfilling. It really was a very great pleasure to be involved in that exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the statistics in the report indicate, the Main Committee has made it possible for the House of Representatives to consider legislation, reports and issues of various kinds in much more detail, and with much more time,  so that members have had a significantly expanded opportunity to speak and to examine legislation and issues. The committee was also pleased with the level of support for the practice of referring bills to standing committees for inquiry and report. That process of having committees examine legislation and other important issues is one which has been very finely developed and very finely tuned as far as the Senate is concerned. But this has been the first occasion when a significant initiative of that kind has been undertaken in the House of Representatives. I believe it will develop and I think it should develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also gave consideration to the minister's second reading speech. One of the provisions of that earlier report was that instead of the second reading speech being made at the time the bill was introduced and the explanatory memorandum was tabled, it would be made immediately preceding the second reading debate. That had some values, but the disadvantages vastly outweighed them. It was done for the following reason. The explanatory memorandum is essentially a bureaucratic statement which summarises the legislation for members of parliament, who are not necessarily experts on the legal way in which legislation is often expressed. So the explanatory memorandum is essentially a product of the bureaucracy. The minister's second reading speech is a political product of the government and of the minister, and while ministers undoubtedly do depend upon their bureaucratic advisers to assist them in the construction of those second reading speeches, those speeches are theirs. They can introduce any sort of political comment that they want to&mdash;and they often do, and should be expected to. But then that speech is not there at the time the explanatory memorandum is tabled. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Lindsay" NAMEID="OG4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But do the courts have regard to the explanatory memorandum in interpreting legislation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they do, of course&mdash;and not only the explanatory memorandum, but also the minister's second reading speech. The Acts Interpretation Act has made that perfectly clear, so the explanatory memorandum also fulfils that legal purpose as well. The minister's second reading speech, in expressing the government's purposes behind the legislation as well, is an important matter as far as the courts are concerned. But, as I emphasise, the minister's second reading speech is a political statement, so the opposition should have access to the text of the second reading speech in advance of its leading speaker being expected to respond to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There could be new elements introduced which are not necessarily reflected in the text of the bill or in the explanatory memorandum to which the shadow minister or the person leading for the opposition would need to respond. And since they need to respond, under these current new arrangements, immediately following the minister's second reading speech, they are often placed at a disadvantage. I do not believe that should be allowed to persist and we have suggested that we revert to the previous arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also made reference to the consideration in detail stage. That is vastly superior to the situation which prevailed before&mdash;the old committee stage&mdash;which, to a large extent, not only in the way in which it was conducted but in the physical actions associated with it, was largely a historical anachronism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the origin of the old committee stage rested with the fact that the old House of Commons would traditionally refer legislation to expert groups which were not necessarily committees of the whole of the House of Commons and, in that context, the speaker of the House of Commons had a special responsibility to the Crown, not so much to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the committee consideration stage of the House of Commons developed, the speaker would vacate the chair, the chairman would sit in the chairman's seat, the symbol of the speaker's authority&mdash;the mace&mdash;would be taken off the table, placed under the table, and a committee of the whole House of Commons would then consider the legislation. We do not do that. The fact that those traditions have persisted, I suppose, reflects well on the traditionalists but is probably under attack by the iconoclasts, of which I am one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has suggested that the consideration in detail stage be continued as it is at the present time. It has assisted a much more even, continuing flow of debate. The interchange in that consideration in detail stage has been much more effective in scrutinising, in detail, elements of the legislation. Each member now has an unlimited number of five-minute grabs during that consideration in detail stage, and I am not aware of any occasion when that opportunity provided for members has been abused&mdash;that is, where they have taken advantage of successive five minutes to make a second speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if you were in the chamber and if you and your colleagues, including the speaker himself, were occupying the chair, you would not allow that to happen anyway. I have to pay credit as well to those people who have occupied the chair in order to ensure that those arrangements serve the purposes and serve the purposes in the way that they were intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an expectation, as we have indicated as well, that ministers should attend the House and the Main Committee to oversee the passage of their legislation. I think generally that ministers have been very responsive to their responsibilities in connection with not only their portfolio responsibilities to the chamber but also their legislation, to members on both sides of the chamber and to this parliament as an institution. This was just a little, gentle and courteous reminder to ministers that they do have a responsibility to oversee their legislation and to ensure the passage of their legislation. They should be there to present the second reading speech; they should be there to hear as much of the debate as they can; and they should be there to respond at the end in order to give the appropriate courtesies to those members on both sides of the House who participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question time is, and will continue to be, a very difficult area. It is not a question time. It is a gladiatorial time, an adversarial time and a theatrical time, but it is not a question time in which members of the opposition seek information. When members of the opposition ask a question they do not want an answer; their purpose in asking the question is to put the government under pressure and then, frequently, when the answer is given, the members of the opposition quite understandably complain because they say that answer is not relevant. On most occasions the claim that the answer is not relevant is based on their perception that the answer is not the answer they wanted their question to elicit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like members of the House of Representatives generally to give consideration to the nature of question time, to the purpose of question time. Questions on notice allow a minister to get expert advice from the bureaucracy and to have the answers prepared. Senior advisers to the ministers and the ministers themselves will vet the answers before those answers go out. That is when members genuinely want information. Question time is not serving that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the questions on notice procedure, which tends to deal with matters of detail and can be a lengthy process, there is a need for members of parliament to get answers to questions about current things, things that are happening today or things that happened yesterday. We need something like a question time. But we should have a question time which is a genuine question time where genuine issues are raised. We also need a true gladiatorial time. We need an opportunity for the government to be placed under pressure by the opposition, not by some artificial device of asking the question&mdash;</PARA>

However, I still feel some regret that this report is not being debated in the main chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst in no way would I denigrate this chamber, the simple fact is that most honourable members have their television tuned to the main chamber, it is the chamber they will drop into in order to listen to speeches for a while, it is the one they tend to be more focused on. I suspect we would have more people involved in this debate today if it were taking place in the main chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I would just like to refer, for the assistance of the honourable member for Charlton&mdash;who was not a member of the committee that did the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report&mdash;to the reason this was called the Main Committee. It was because it was envisaged that it would meet in the main committee room, and that is actually stated in that report. That suggestion ran into difficulties because the main committee room is not the property of the House of Representatives. It is a part of Parliament House that is shared by the House of Representatives and the Senate. To set it up permanently as a chamber of the House of Representatives would have created difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member spoke I had the thought, which I just float here for the first time, that perhaps we might consult with our colleagues and see whether there is an alternative name that they would like given to this chamber that might be a bit more appropriate. Given that we have done away with the committee stages of bills, I find it now rather confusing when I see on the House of Representatives blue that we are going to have a Main Committee report. This is not a committee, it does not in any way resemble a committee: it is part of the House of Representatives. Perhaps we ought to think, before we go very much further, about getting a more appropriate name for this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am limited to 15 minutes today&mdash;now 13 minutes&mdash;so I have to confine the subjects I am going to cover. The subjects I would like to touch on, if I get time, are question time, second reading speeches and cognate debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure has already referred to the fact that question time is a thorny issue. In this report, at paragraph 6.4.4, there is some further discussion of this issue. It ought to be put on the record that when the committee invited all the members of the House of Representatives to comment on the changes to procedures that had followed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report, overwhelmingly their comments were concerned with question time. The committee did not actually invite the sorts of comments they made, which were recommendations about relevance, content of questions and answers and so on. These aspects were not touched on in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report and were therefore not really affected by the changes that the government ultimately made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is pointed out in this report, the committee has taken on board this clear concern of honourable members of both sides and will be pursuing the issue. There are always difficulties on this subject and heaven knows the Procedure Committee has reported on it enough times, but the chairman and I are going to try to find a way around that so that we can get some better discussion of question time and a better resolution than we have to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be placed on the record, as the report does, that the changes that were made to question time following the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report were not the changes that that report recommended. From time to time government ministers&mdash;particularly the new Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), as Leader of the Government in the House&mdash;have said, `But the Procedures Committee recommended changes to question time.' And indeed we did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended that there be an experiment with the roster on Mondays only, but that in no way resembles what the government ended up doing. The roster issue has to be addressed. It is noted in the report that the recommendation of the committee that there be consultation between government and opposition as to the composition of the roster has not been observed. This has been raised by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith)&mdash;it appeared to me at the time to be to the great surprise of the Leader of the House, who seemed to be oblivious to the fact that he ought to be consulting. I do not think that the situation has much improved, but if we are to get a better feeling in the chamber and a better handling of business, it is important that consultation takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree with the member for Charlton that the House of Representatives ought to be an adversarial place. It will naturally be an adversarial place on occasions, but there has to be room for consensus too. The simple fact is that a lot of things are done by consensus, and we get unnecessary conflict because we approach the chamber in an adversarial way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may be so bold&mdash;I know a number of my sisters would agree with me&mdash;there is a feeling that the nature of doing business here is excessively masculine. The ideas of combat, adversaries and `blood flowing', as the member for Charlton said, are now a little outdated. There is room for a more mature, and better rounded, human approach to the way governments and oppositions do their business. As I have said, the adversarial nature will express itself naturally from time to time; that is to be expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer particularly to paragraphs 6.1.7, 6.2.10, 6.2.12 and 6.2.16 of the report, where it is pointed out that a stated aim of the roster, when it was introduced by the government and when it was considered by the committee&mdash;albeit the committee made a different recommendation&mdash;was to involve more ministers. We have in the report some tables which show questions without notice to ministers, from 1992 to 1994. There is some consideration given to the fact that more junior ministers are being asked questions than previously. It might have been instructive if we had asked for one further table: a breakdown of the questions from government members to junior ministers, as opposed to questions from opposition members to junior ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that question time has, on occasions, been turned into a platform for ministerial statements, particularly by junior ministers. A breakdown of the questions asked of junior ministers would show that government members are far more likely to be asking the dorothy dixer of the junior minister. It is the junior minister who gets frustrated because he or she does not get the opportunity to speak very often. The junior minister gets up and gives a dorothy dix answer, which is really a ministerial statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our report, we tried to come to grips with the issue of ministerial statements, and we make some suggestions. I draw particular attention to paragraph 4.4.6, some subsequent paragraphs and the accompanying table 3. The question of the government moving away from giving ministerial statements has been debated in the House, particularly when we have debated Procedure Committee reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the record that in 1982&mdash;the last year of a Liberal government&mdash;there were 80 ministerial statements. In 1994, the most recent full parliamentary year, there were 16. The drop since 1983 has been very marked. A comparison of that figure with the increase in the length of time that individual answers have taken, together with the table showing the decline in the number of questions without notice, gives the story. Question time has been turned into a pseudo ministerial statement time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the member for Charlton, as a former minister, has some sympathy for the problems of ministers. I do remember some of the answers he gave to questions even to this day; I cannot remember whether they were dorothy dixers&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far be it from me to refer to the other chamber, but I have been removed from it for 10 1/2 years now, so I feel a little safer in referring to it these days than I did when I first transferred to the House of Representatives. The Senate has, over time, evolved a system of a better use of supplementary questions and also a system of taking note of answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This latter system gives an opposition member&mdash;or a government member&mdash;the opportunity to make a comment on an answer to a question, but does not exclude the minister from making further comment himself or herself. I know that the House of Representatives never wants to look like it is taking any hints from the Senate, but the fact that that system has worked shows that the type of suggestion that the member for Charlton made might have some merit and might be quite workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wanted to make in this context is that, whilst there is a stated desire by the government to involve ministers more in the chamber, when you look at their conduct when it comes to their bills, the direct opposite is happening. If ministers really wanted to be more involved in the chamber, they would involve themselves at the obvious stage&mdash;and that is the consideration of bills stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report does address this subject. I refer members to page 4 and onwards and, in particular, to table 2 on page 11, which shows government bills introduced in 1994. It refers to participation of ministers and, in particular, to the second reading debate summing up. There are some ministers who give their own second reading speeches, who are there for at least some part of the debate and who reply to the debate. As a member, I appreciate that very much. However, those ministers&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;are very few in number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred in the past to the fact that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is probably the worst example in this area that the parliament has. She comes into question time when she is on the roster and gives a long answer to a dorothy dixer&mdash;but gives very brief answers to opposition questions&mdash;and then she does not appear again all week. For her first few months here, she was only appearing to answer dorothy dixers. I think she thought it was actually bad luck if anybody else dared to ask her a question while she was there on the roster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After I had remarked on this a few times, she came in once and read a second reading speech. I remind you that this Minister for Human Services and Health is also the minister who is responsible for the status of women. She is yet to participate in a debate on any child-care bills which are introduced in her name in the House. That is left to her parliamentary secretary. That is disgraceful. Ministers cannot say they want a roster so that they can get a guernsey in question time and then not attend for their bills&mdash;something which is just as important as answering questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three columns in table 2. One shows who presented the bills: the `Minister from the responsible portfolio'; the `Parliamentary Secretary from the responsible portfolio'; a `Minister from another portfolio'; a `Parliamentary Secretary from another portfolio'; or `No Minister or Parliamentary Secretary'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, there is a blank in the column that is headed `Second reading speech delivered by' under that last section called `No minister or parliamentary secretary'. This is because second reading speeches on government bills cannot be given any way other than by a minister or parliamentary secretary. However, out of the 192 bills, 32 have been read by a parliamentary secretary who is not even in that portfolio. I do not mean to put them down, but parliamentary secretaries are very junior people in the hierarchy in terms of answerability to the public or to the government or to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even worse is that the second reading debate is summed up on only 43 occasions out of 192 by a minister from the responsible portfolio. That does not mean the debate has been summed up by the minister responsible for that bill. It just means that it has been summed up by one of the ministers in that portfolio grouping. If one calculated the number of times the second reading speech was replied to by the minister who was actually responsible for that bill and its administration, the number would be found to be significantly lower than 43. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The column which indicates that 24 second reading debates were summed up by a parliamentary secretary from another portfolio shows us that the person who answers a debate in summary has no status at all. Worst is that 65 second reading debates were not replied to or summed up by any minister or parliamentary secretary. They are issues that should concern us all, both government and opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems for procedure committees, particularly when the government has a majority in the House, as it is required to do to form a government, is that recommendations need to be made with a mind's eye actually intent on getting them through. Procedure committees do not serve parliamentarians, the people or the parliament as well as they might if their reports languish and gather dust. That has not happened. Although <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About Time</EMPHASIS> was not implemented in the way the committee recommended, we should not necessarily see that as a failure. We should rather welcome the fact that the government has responded positively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about some of the changes in the review. I want to say that I have always been a keen advocate of the rostering of ministers. I know the opposition members, not necessarily members of the committee, make great capital of rostering because they say we have a part-time Prime Minister. My area of disappointment, I suppose, is that I always believe that rostering ministers would open up the ministerial ranks to some opposition fast bowling. Whilst the opposition actually got the scalp of the former honourable member for Canberra Ros Kelly, it has not subsequently demonstrated an understanding of tactics in question time to take advantage of it. I am not trying to score points. From my own perspective, I think the opposition has failed to realise the potential opportunities that I always believe rostering provided. As the honourable member for Charlton said, I think we should not shrink from the fact that question time is always going to be robust. It is going to be the gladiatorial contest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to note some changes about question time. Before the prominence of TV, the press media, by and large, dictated the flavour of what occurred at question time. Radio sometimes broadcast it but to very limited audiences. TV now provides the 10-second or 60-second grab. That is used as much to its advantage by the opposition as it is by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make is a fairly simple one. As a traditionalist, I like to think that we are essentially parliamentarians in this place, as I know the member for Charlton and others do. We have to make the parliament relevant and we have to keep it current. We should value our traditions and nurture them but make them relevant to the current age. And that is why it is impossible to suggest that we can turn back the clock as far as the impact of TV on question time is concerned, and I would not seek to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the member for Moncrieff made a point about the limitations of ministerial statements. Let me say that I, for one, would welcome far more ministerial statements by the government. I do not think any government should shrink from being in a position to put its point of view to the people and to the parliament. But, if there has been a diminution of ministerial statements, I have to say that these things are often being done now outside the parliament to gain maximum impact, to make sure as many as possible of our fellow Australians come to understand what the statement is all about. A good example of that, which we discussed in the committee, was the Justice Statement, something delivered in Queensland. I am sure that, if the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) had delivered that statement in the House, it would not have made the same impact, and I commend the committee for recommending that, although a statement may have been made outside the parliament, we should have an opportunity to discuss it and dissect it. That is one of the areas where I suggest we should be more relevant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is good, and I would like to see more of that. I want to refer to question time in the Senate. The Senate has introduced something that we all thought would be absolutely ludicrous and unworkable and would completely limit ministers, and that was time limits on the questions being asked and time limits on the answers. If Senate ministers were sent a questionnaire, I think they would say that the system is working pretty well and in fact it has probably sharpened up ministerial answers. I wish I could say that I could imagine this happening in the lower house. I cannot envisage it at this time, but I do think it is something that we should keep in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moore (Mr Filing) had a particular interest in questions on notice and brought forward the suggestion of having a time limit on responses. The committee developed a method whereby members could rise in their places if questions had not been answered after 90 days and raise the matter with the Speaker and the Speaker would write to the relevant minister. I am very pleased to see that the committee has now recommended that that be brought back to 60 days. This is still a very generous period of time. I do not think it is at all arduous for ministers or departments. Ironically, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;I see that an interchange is going to take place here&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. On the hours of sitting, I must say that I was very much an enthusiast for reducing the hours of sitting. As the chairman of the committee has accurately reported, we are leading much more sensible lives, finishing as we do at 8 o'clock instead of 11 o'clock or even much later, but I would like to make the observation that in the period of time that we are here we are much more frenetic about what we are doing. We seem to be going to more and more committee meetings at a greater pace, and perhaps missing some of them. I do not know about my colleagues, but I certainly confess that. So, if we are to take full advantage of these reduced sitting hours, it seems to me that we really need to look at our committee system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were one area that I would invite the Procedure Committee to look at, it would be the area of committees of the House. That is not because I think they are bad&mdash;I think we were behind the times in moving to a committee system and the committee system has accomplished a lot&mdash;but because I think that there are far too many committees. We run the risk of drowning or diminishing or executing our committees by overload. However, there are still areas where I would like to see the committee system taken to. For example, I still remain very much in favour of having joint House and Senate committees. Once again, I welcome the hours of sitting. Unfortunately, the Procedure Committee cannot deal with party committees, and there are obviously party committees that opposition members go to and government members go to. I make the plea that both are in need of reform and adjusting, in the way we have adjusted the hours of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw to the attention of the House, and particularly of my good friend the member for Charlton, the issue of legislation that goes into the House. Firstly, there is a lot of criticism. I know that the member for Moncrieff is saying, `Isn't it dreadful that ministers aren't in the chamber all the time, looking to their business.' It remains a fact that much more legislation goes through the House of Representatives because the Senate does not agree to delegated legislation to the same extent as, say, the English system does. In other words, what is legislation in Australia would often be delegated legislation in England. So we have a much higher bill load than anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the key issue here is whether, on the important bills rather than the omnibus bills, the House and the Senate are giving legislation adequate consideration. Again in terms of keeping relevant with the times, the introduction of this Main Committee chamber is a bit of parliamentary microeconomic reform. It means that we do not have to have extra members or extra anything but this second chamber allows more people to participate than would otherwise be the case and it allows more legislation to go through than would otherwise be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always thought that you cannot inculcate the urgency or necessity for ministers to steer through their own legislation, and it is not always possible. Whilst legislation is an important aspect of their work, as the honourable member for Charlton will tell us, there are many other competing aspects that can prevent ministers being there. However, I think there is an element of pride in a minister taking an important bill through the House and I would be disappointed if that tradition was ever lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to address the role of parliamentary secretaries. When they were first appointed under this government, similar to the earlier Fraser appointments, they were more like secretaries&mdash;answering bag loads of correspondence and attending functions&mdash;but I am pleased to say that their role has now evolved to much more than that. Parliamentary secretaries still deal with a lot of the administrative matters but, by and large, most of them have a discrete portfolio area. Whilst that may be minor in the mainstream of the portfolio, it is still a portfolio area. In that regard, it is very hard to detect the difference between junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries other than that the parliamentary secretary must report to the cabinet minister, whereas junior ministers often do not have that same diligent requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, in a small way, I am pleased to be associated with what is a good report which will bring important reforms to the parliament. I am sure my colleagues are going to receive the report well, as they did the initial report. I commend those associated with it and particularly encourage our chairman to take on new and even bolder tasks for the Standing Committee on Procedure in the interests of the parliament and parliamentary reform. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who is present here today, that is, the member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson). I commend the member for Wentworth on his interest in the procedures of the House and I look forward to hearing and reading his contributions to the workings of the committee. I am sure he will make a great contribution, obviously bringing from his background a new perspective to the workings of the House, not the least of which will be his great interest in the workings of similar legislatures around the region, of which he has great knowledge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I once again commend the staff of the secretariat of the committee because they have also been responsible for helping us to prepare what I consider to be an important and useful report that will assist in compelling, or perhaps influencing, the government to make the changes necessary to allow this process in the House of Representatives and the Main Chamber to evolve in a way that is going to allow for a greater movement of power back to the parliament&mdash;in the case of the workings of the House of Representatives&mdash;vis-a-vis the executive. I can see the member for Charlton nodding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we would all agree that in many ways the recent history of the House of Representatives has seen a decline in the authority of the relative standings between the Executive and the parliament that needs to be stopped. The process needs to be reversed to allow the people's representatives to properly bring forward the views of their constituents and make sure they have an opportunity to influence the day-to-day events of the House of Representatives and indeed the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few observations I would like to make in relation to the workings of the House. The first is in relation to the explanatory memorandum, which was the subject of the recommendation that departments should take steps to improve the usefulness of explanatory memoranda to members and others seeking clarification on the nature, purpose and effect of legislation. We also recommended that, whenever possible, in the case of government bills, ministers should make an explanation to the House of any amendments or requests for amendments made by the Senate on which the Senate is seeking agreement of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our deliberations I cited the case of the Training Guarantee Levy Bill where there was a conflict between the explanatory memorandum and the actual bill. That was very confusing for those people who are responsible in their own businesses or elsewhere for the administration of&mdash;or response to&mdash;the legislation. In this particular case, there was a difference in the way in which one calculated the training guarantee liability on the part of a business. In fact, the explanatory memorandum allowed for the inclusion of sick leave and long service leave whereas the actual bill excluded it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the people at the particular business that contacted me about the matter made inquiries of the Taxation Office, which had the responsibility for administering the act, they were informed that the bill was right and the explanatory memorandum was wrong. Clearly, people relying on the explanatory memorandum for guidance as to how the act was supposed to work would have been thoroughly confused about the difference in the amounts applicable to employing more people. In this particular case, they told me that in their business they could have employed an extra person on the difference between the two interpretations of the explanatory memorandum and the bill itself. That is a very important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second important matter was raised by the member for Moncrieff. I commend her for her contribution as deputy chair. She has always taken a strong interest in the workings of parliament in the Senate and continues that role in the House of Representatives. She has been instrumental in making the recommendation that the standing orders be amended to enable a minister to move the second reading of a government bill immediately following the first reading and for debate then to be adjourned to a future day. The recommendation also seeks  to make the second reading speech available for members so that they can not only interpret the legislation but also make their own contributions to the debate. It is thoroughly confusing if the second reading speech is not available, particularly if interpretations of legislation have already been made by the minister or if there is a policy, for example, on the interpretation of legislation which would cause debate or questions that would need to be clarified as to exactly how legislation would work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member who spoke previously mentioned my own particular interest in questions on notice. As I am now an independent member I am more conscious of the fact that there are limited opportunities for ministers to be questioned by members of the House. I am particularly concerned that the questions on notice that are placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> should be accorded the seriousness they deserve by those responsible for answering them. In previous times there have been extraordinary delays in the responses made by ministers to questions placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, to the extent that the process has been undermined. At the end of each question time, as we know, the minister, the Leader of the House or the Prime Minister&mdash;whoever is responsible&mdash;moves that further questions be placed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, signifying how important as part of the process of questioning the questions on notice actually are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we on the committee unanimously felt that it was absurd that often, in the case of questions on notice, not only were ministers not responding to them for up to years in the sitting of a particular parliament but, in some instances, never answered the questions before the parliament concluded. Therefore those questions fell over the end of the cliff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the workings of the changes to the sessional orders that were recommended and introduced as a consequence of our previous report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS>, we have seen a process whereby at the conclusion, where 90 days has passed and the question has not been responded to by a minister, members can stand up and ask the Speaker to write to the minister concerned requesting that an answer be given. I think that is a perfectly reasonable process. The difficulty is, of course, that 90 days is a long time and I am very pleased that the committee has decided to change that to 60 days. That will put additional pressure on to ministers to gee up their process of answering questions. As we all know, sometimes questions have an immediate effect or immediate importance and, after 90 days, they disappear into what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) often calls `the ether'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a part of the process that individual members want to see reinforced and buttressed. Therefore, our recommendation that the 90 days be reduced to 60 days is a thoroughly useful one. In fact, at the conclusion of the question period on each sitting Thursday, it is recommended that the Speaker should make a report to the House listing those ministers to whom he or she has written pursuant to the standing order, any responses received, and those ministers who were reported in a previous report as having been written to and who have not responded, giving the date of the original letter. That report would be recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very important part of our processes. After all, in the final analysis, the only opportunity for members really to question the workings of government in a direct way is in the question time period. I know that there is a recommendation there to bring question time to 2.30&mdash;another important move. I was a critic of the move to 3 o'clock in the first instance, because I believed that it would make it extraordinarily difficult for the media, particularly the electronic media on which the public relies so heavily for information, to actually report in a proper way, in a fair way, the question time period. Of course, because of the concertina effect between 3 o'clock and the ending of question time at half past four, the electronic media in particular often found it extraordinarily difficult to be able to deal with the tape and all the other video arrangements so that the public could be properly informed of what had gone on that day in question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We obviously are concerned about the rostering system because the rostering system has led to instances where ministers are not present on particular days and a line of questioning has not been able to be followed by the opposition. If one were to see the parliamentary process as an adversarial one, then the question time period is the grinding edge of our democratic system. Clearly, if the members of the public are to retain any vestiges of confidence in their political system, then they need to know that that particular process works. I know that many probably view it with some jaundice in that they see on television the noise, the commotion and the dynamics of it, but nonetheless that is the grinding edge of our political democratic system. As a consequence, it is important that it works properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, it is important that the public see it working properly. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that the starting time of question time be moved to 2.30. If that is not the case, then we are going to see the continuation of the problem that question time will not be properly reported to the public because, as I said, it is so close to the deadlines for the electronic media on which most people rely for their daily information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect on question time is that members of the opposition and other members of the House who are wanting to question ministers about particular aspects of their portfolio are in a position to request the presence of a minister so that they can answer questions that happen to be pertinent to that particular day's events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the report is not everything we would like to see, and not everything I would like to see. There are a number of things that we have obviously had to compromise on to come to a determination in the committee. Nonetheless, I think this is an important adjunct to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report from last year from which those important changes were made. We would like to see enhanced opportunities for members to use the questioning process in a more incisive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking forward to seeing how the recommendations affect the government's view and whether in fact it responds in a way that is going to allow us to have that opportunity. As an independent member, I am anxious to see that the House works in a way that allows the people's representatives to be able to represent the views of the community, and to make sure that ministers are properly accountable for the administration of taxpayers' money.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make a point about the difficulties which the chairman has in respect of sitting hours. The chairman sits on a massively malapportioned committee. This is a committee which is massively malapportioned in terms of New South Wales, length of service of members and safety of seats. In other words, the views and the deliberations of this committee do not reflect those people throughout the parliament who live in outlying states, who occupy marginal seats and who are the newer or younger members of this parliament who are more likely to have families with young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appear on behalf of my wife, my 3 1/2-year-old son and my 18-month-old daughter, and the other family members from Western Australia. I know that all my comments will be joined by my friend and colleague the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). With all the difficulties that Western Australian metropolitan members have, at least when we touch down at the airport we have a short drive home; when he touches down at the airport, he has an additional two hours drive to get to Bunbury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look at the massively malapportioned committee in terms of safety of seats. I will not go through all the individual seat holders. The chairman, of course, has a margin of 17.2 per cent. I will not get down to the fine analysis as to how much of that is his personal vote and standing, but the average safety of the seats of the members is over 12 per cent. In terms of the membership of the committee, five members come from New South Wales, two from Queensland and one from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the comments of the independent member for Moore (Mr Filing)&mdash;the very fine independent member for Moore&mdash;that he has been obliged to retire from the committee to be replaced by another safe seat New South Wales member. I can understand the chairman's difficulties here. The massive malapportionment of seniority, safe seats and New South Wales is only going to be enhanced, although the member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) will, of course, bring some youthful aspirations and vigour to the deliberations of this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at length of service, the average tenure of committee members is over 10 years. This does not include the service which the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) had previously in the Senate. So this is a committee which does not have as part of its full focus a view for the difficulties caused to outlying state members, to marginal seat holders or to those members likely to have young families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the starting point? It is prospective changes to sitting hours. As I have said, these are in section 9.2 of the committee's report. What brought about the current system? It was brought about by a view that the parliament was sitting too late into the night. When I first arrived in this place in May 1993, the schedule of sitting patterns and hours for the House was that we sat Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Invariably, we sat until 11.30 at night and, from memory, on Wednesday we got up at 8 o'clock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was changed&mdash;I think sensibly&mdash;to the 8 o'clock close from Monday through to Wednesday, and a 6 o'clock close on Thursday. The rationale for that was that it was not sensible to sit those late hours. That was right. The price that was paid for that was that we sat Monday to Thursday, Monday to Thursday, on a fortnightly cycle. In other words, we sat an additional Monday throughout our entire sitting pattern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effect did that have on Western Australian members? The effect was that they lost 10 Sundays per year in their electorate or with their families. Why is that the case? If members are required to arrive at the parliament on Monday, then they must leave Perth on a Sunday. The latest that members can leave Perth on a Sunday is effectively 5 o'clock, on a flight to Melbourne. That flight arrives in Melbourne at about 11 o'clock and then, courtesy of ministerial arrangements, the members catch a RAAF VIP flight to Canberra. They arrive in Canberra in theory at 12.30. Life being what it is, that is usually any time between 12.30 and 1.30 a.m. The consequence for the electorate and the families of those members from Western Australia is that they effectively lose 10 Sunday afternoons per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original recommendation which saw those changes had the close of sitting at 8 o'clock on a Thursday. I made Neal Blewett's life such a misery that in the end the committee recommended that the parliament close at 6 o'clock on Thursday to at least give members from outlying states the chance to get home on a Thursday night. In that respect, I was grateful for the strong support I received from the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Banks (Mr Melham). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at how that change has worked in practice. It has been the case&mdash;but more often not&mdash;that the 6 o'clock close enables members from Western Australia to get on a 6.30 plane to arrive in Western Australia at 11.30. From time to time, the 6 o'clock close on Thursday becomes an 8 o'clock close. In the course of recent months, that has occurred more often than not, either for the budget reply of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), or for his reply on the republican issue. So that opportunity is sometimes lost. If the parliament does not get up until 8 o'clock on a Thursday night, members from Western Australia cannot get home on Thursday night, and so they lose that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of my suggestions to the committee at our informal session, I elaborated on my formal written submission which suggested that the parliament should close earlier on the Thursday evening. My basic submission was that modest adjustments to our closing time on Thursday, coupled with modest adjustments to airline schedules, would guarantee that members from Western Australia, if they so desired&mdash;which I invariably do, and the member for Forrest shares my passionate obsession&mdash;would have the opportunity to return home on a Thursday night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That suggestion was not taken up by the committee. The most weighty point that was made in response to my suggestion was that, with parliament question time starting at 3 o'clock, and with the MPI on a Thursday, to close the House at 5.00 or 5.30 would leave no time for other matters and would not take into account things that might develop out of question time, such as censures and the like. I think that is a sensible point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fallback position was: `Why don't we suggest some modest changes to the airline arrangement?' So I took the opportunity of getting hold of the submissions by Qantas and Ansett. I will read them into the record because they make patently clear that neither of the airlines has any understanding of what we do. That reflects as badly on us as it does on them, because it makes crystal clear the point that we have not bothered to take up the changes in our sitting patterns with the airlines in any forceful, constructive or detailed way. The Qantas submission says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Qantas in providing travel management services to Members of Parliament and their staff have found the new procedures require more flexibility in arranging departure times. The previous Friday morning departure enable configuration changes to our aircraft in order to facilitate greater premium seat availability.</PARA>
<PARA>I read that twice and I asked the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) to explain to me what it meant. He said what it meant was that they had no understanding of what was going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is right, and that is reflected by a notice from Qantas that I tabled at my informal session with the committee. It is headed `Qantas, the Australian airline, budget week special' and then tells us what a fantastic deal we get: we can depart Canberra and arrive in Perth on a new configurated jet on Thursday night, leaving at 7.40. The only problem is that no-one bothered to tell the people from Qantas, and they never bothered to check, that 7.40 happened to be 10 minutes into the reply by Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). That is not a plane that any person who has any respect for the courtesies of this parliament could catch. I happen to believe it is important to listen to the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply, whatever side of the House you are on. This reflected their ignorance, and our lack of effort, in seeking to make some sensible arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ansett airline reply is just as bad. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key area affecting the airline is obviously the change in sitting hours, which has been brought forward on a Thursday. Essentially this factor has enabled Ansett Australia to provide a greater availability of our premium seating and relieved pressure on all associated Friday morning services.</PARA>
<PARA>So they are pleased that we are not there, en bloc, on Friday. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the traveller point of view, it also enables far better through service connections to ports further afield, such as Perth.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I must confess I have dozed off and missed that bit! It further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our increases in direct services to both Brisbane and Adelaide have also provided further flexibility in travel options around sitting arrivals and departure times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general terms a continuation of both the change in sitting times and improvements in our schedule ex Canberra has eased congestion on key flights and improved the ability for us to accommodate travellers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, because all the politicians are not flying home on a Friday morning, things are easier for other people. But not one thought, not one jot, not one iota of effort&mdash;either by us or by them&mdash;has been put to the configurations which apply on a Thursday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here are the Thursday flight options which applied on the night of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply and which apply tonight. There are five departures from Ansett between 4.30 and 7.40 p.m. and three departures from Qantas between 6.45 and 9.40 p.m. Five leave just before anyone would have the chance of even sneaking out the door once the adjournment started. Modest changes to the airlines' timetable and modest changes to our timetable would have the effect of ensuring that some people, if they wanted to&mdash;and this is entirely a matter of choice&mdash;would get home on Thursday night. Others might prefer to spend the entire week here. This was a point made to me by the member for Moncrieff in the course of the informal discussions. Other people would prefer to spend the four days here and then get back to home, family, electorate and constituents as quickly as humanly possible. That is my preference and I would like to try to guarantee that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other submission which I thought was worth quickly referring to was that by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Lyn Barlin. At page 6 of his submission he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only additional comment I would make in relation to sitting hours is that there is very little effective government business time available on Thursday afternoons after 3.00 pm. There is frequently great pressure on available time before 5.30 pm once question time begins if any complication occurs (keeping in mind that there is usually a matter of public importance proposed for discussion as well.)</PARA>
<PARA>On a Thursday afternoon, once question time begins, you are never going to have any effective chance for government business. Why? Because Thursday afternoon is precisely the time that any opposition&mdash;worth its salt or not worth its salt&mdash;will raise censures, will cause disruption, for maximum political effect. The members opposite would do it, and we would do it if the roles were, however so disastrously or inelegantly, reversed. So any sensible management of government business requires that whatever business has to get done is done before question time on Thursday. After that, you are at the mercy of the political motivations of the opposition&mdash;which I respect and acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the committee did not take up my suggestion that we close the parliament half an hour or an hour earlier on a Thursday. Its formal recommendation 9.3.6 recommended that question time should commence at 2.30 p.m. each sitting day. Game, set and match: 6-4, 6-4, 5-3; new balls; the member for Perth is serving. If question time is at 2.30 p.m., not one moment is lost by starting the House on Thursday morning at 9.00 and starting the adjournment at 5 o'clock rather than at 5.30. It is a modest half-hour adjustment and, with a bit of detailed vigorous application to the airlines, we might actually achieve some sensible configurations which would make life better for those honourable members from Western Australia and other outlying states who happen to have marginal seats and young families. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us who come from states not as distant as Western Australia are sympathetic to the difficulty that the Western Australians allude to&mdash;to the pressure that sitting in the federal parliament places on young families and with the distances travelled.

In that sense, South Australia enjoys an advantage that is geographically denied to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few comments about the report, and I want to make them in the context of this Parliament House. I share with both the chair and the deputy chair the reality of having worked in this Parliament House and in the former Parliament House building. I am one of those people who thought that the former Parliament House ought to have been remodelled and ought to have remained the home of the federal parliament. It is not a view that I would still maintain because I think this is a building in which it is a great privilege to work and the architecture and facility of the building is something of which we all should be proud. I do recognise that the building has inevitably two problems, and those of us who have worked in both buildings are more conscious of these problems than are those who have worked only in this building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two problems are that parliament is more polarised in this building and that it is easier for members of parliament to become isolated in this building. I lay the blame for the first problem, that of polarisation, largely at the feet of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and I do this in an uncharacteristically uncharitable way. The Prime Minister's style is to polarise the parliament. I respect his capacity to do this, but his style is to treat the opposition as if it were some lesser form of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something about which I am quite indignant. We need constantly to remind ourselves, as parliamentarians, that everyone in the parliament not only has a right to be there, by dint of having been elected, but also has a right to an opinion, whether in government or in opposition. The opposition, regardless of which party is in opposition, has an obligation to speak for all of those people who did not vote for the government. I am charitable enough to recognise that even the Prime Minister may be prepared to concede that in a private moment, but certainly none of his mannerisms in the House would attest to that approach. So I find existence in this house much more polarised than it was in the other house, with the same party in power but with a different person as the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having largely placed blame for the polarisation at the feet of the Prime Minister, I now address the question of isolation. This parliament building, by very reason of its extent, is a place in which people easily become isolated. As I look at the way in which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure addresses the whole question of the structure and sitting times of the House, I think we have an obligation to ensure that we do all we can to break down any sense of individual isolation. Part of the isolation is inevitable because of the architecture of the building. Part of it is inevitable because of the extensive facilities that we all have in our own offices, which allow us to be individuals and, if we choose, not to mix extensively with our colleagues. But part of it is broken down, I think, by a structuring of the sitting hours to ensure that people have maximum contact with each other if they choose so to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the Standing Committee on Procedure, when contemplating sitting hours, might care to take up is a proposal that we sit once again on Monday and Tuesday evenings; that there be a scheduled dining room time, as there once used to be, from 6.30 to eight; and that the parliament then sit from eight until 9.30, with a 9.30 adjournment. This would still allow the parliament to rise at a very respectable hour and it would still leave Wednesday evenings free for the sort of interaction that has become characteristic of Wednesday evenings, but it would mean that the total sitting time was extended and that the dining room became once again the focus for most honourable members who were in the parliament on a Monday and Tuesday evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had an opportunity to discuss with the caterers, or with the Speaker's office, just what the impact on the dining room of our decision to rise at eight has been, but I suspect from what I have observed that it has been chaotic. I suspect that the caterers have no idea from one evening to another how many honourable members are likely to be dining in or dining out. It has also broken down the dining room fraternity that was built up, that was particularly significant in the old Parliament House and to a lesser degree extended into this Parliament House, but that now scarcely exists because at 8 p.m. people make a decision either to dine in or to dine out. I respect their right to do that, but the opportunity for some sort of parliamentary fraternity, by reason of the fact that we are all going to the dining room between 6.30 and eight, has been broken down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would like the committee to consider taking Monday and Tuesday evenings and extending briefly the sitting time by, I am suggesting, not more than two hours&mdash;that may be a matter for negotiation&mdash;to ensure that the House still rose at a very civilised hour but that we remained more of a unit and that we broke down some of the isolation that I think unintentionally, but unfortunately, has come to characterise the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to compliment the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) on the work that she has done on this committee and to acknowledge the role of the chairman and the role that the committee has played in endeavouring both to listen to the opinion of a wide range of people in the parliament and to incorporate, as far as they are able, that opinion in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion by the honourable member for Moncrieff that, on the tabling of the first reading of a bill, the second reading speech ought to be made available is one that I would also like to endorse. Much is to be said for the capacity of the opposition to have at its fingertips, as early as possible, the information that the minister presents in the second reading speech so that informed debate can be a characteristic of the second reading of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like also to compliment the committee and give my support to the suggestion that question time ought to commence at 2.30. That has a great deal to commend it, not only from the point of view of ensuring that the media have a more comfortable opportunity to observe question time but also because one of the things that, incredibly, have characterised question time is that electors now find themselves less able to access question time on television than was the case, because of the congestion of television time beyond 3 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This led to an extraordinary reaction in my electorate&mdash;and I am being kind to the Leader of the House and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) in acknowledging this&mdash;in that one of my constituents, indignant at what was happening, sent a letter to the Deputy Prime Minister, with a copy to myself, saying that he was unhappy with the 3 p.m. question time and asking the Deputy Prime Minister why it was that the House had chosen to move to that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;well intentioned, I am sure&mdash;replied, saying that one of the reasons that we had moved to 3 p.m. was that if there were visiting delegations it meant a very congested lunchtime, and the 3 p.m. question time allowed us to appropriately extend the lunchtime. That is perfectly true. But, constituents being what they are, and the image of parliamentarians being what it is, my constituent instantly translated that to mean that every lunchtime was extended from 12.30 until 3.00, that every lunchtime involved visiting delegations and that this was an indication of just how cavalier we, as a parliament, happen to be in the way in which we deal with the affairs of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that was not the intention of the Leader of the House and Deputy Prime Minister, but I do think that, in a small way, the decision to go to 2.30 helped to break down that impression. Incidentally, I believe that the 2.30 question time has a great deal to commend it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also happen to find, along with other opposition members, that the present question time roster is a source of a frustration to us. The recommendation of the committee that would allow ministers to be brought in more frequently is one that ought to be endorsed by the parliament. I say to the member for Charlton that he may well recall&mdash;though it is now longer ago than I would care to admit&mdash;the frustration of being an opposition backbencher in question time, and the difficulty of getting opposition backbench questions up. That is frustrating enough, without having it complicated and compounded by the absence of ministers whom the opposition particularly wishes to question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend the committee on the decision to extend the grievance debate. That is entirely appropriate. Grievance ought to occupy the minimum of one hour and 20 minutes, and it has frequently been unintentionally compressed. I point out to the committee that the grievance debate is very important to all members, particularly to backbenchers. It does provide a unique opportunity, in that it allows backbenchers to participate during a broadcast time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one should make any comparison between the grievance debate and the adjournment debate. The adjournment debate is seen as a relatively unimportant instrument in comparison with grievance. The decision to ensure that grievance no longer ends at 5.15, but becomes an obligatory one hour and 20 minutes, is one I would like to endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again thank the committee for their deliberations and their consideration. As I have indicated, I am largely happy with the recommendations outlined in the report. I would however ask the committee at some future date to consider the wisdom of extending Monday and Tuesday evening sittings, not only to extend the business of the House, but to in some small way break down the isolation which is an unintended consequence of working in this building. This is largely in the hands of us as individuals, but it would be facilitated if we were to spend more time in dining in the same place at the same time. That was certainly our experience in the old house&mdash;and such a change would be a relief to the caterers, who must find the present provisions quite unpredictable. </PARA>

But, as both of us would miss that so much, we decided that an arrangement like that would not be terrific for parliamentary democracy, let alone for our own particular interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedure Committee meetings are very interesting, and I think the committee has, over the period since its inception, done a lot to change the way in which the culture of this place works. Those members who have been here for a while might remember that, prior to the Procedure Committee, we used to have a standing orders committee, which used meet on a very irregular basis. In the main, the government would say no to anything the opposition said, and the opposition would come away unhappy. Now we have the Procedure Committee being very generous, and the government being exceptionally generous in accepting recommendations, and the opposition members still are not happy, but they have probably now got more reason to be less unhappy than we were when the standing orders committee was in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very interesting nowadays to listen to interjections and points of order at question time about how terrible the standing orders are. I have a quiet smile when I look over at the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). If the opposition thinks that the current standing orders for question time are draconian, terrible, horrid and awful, and that they stop democratic discussion and allow ministers to get away with all sorts of devilment, then they can thank the right honourable member for New England, because these were all his idea when he was persecuting us some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Procedure Committee has adopted a more enlightened attitude to many of these things, and I will mention just a couple of those things in this debate and say a few things about what the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) have said. The member for Wakefield wants to dine and the member for Perth wants to go home. The committee looked long and hard at the propositions put forward by people about these sorts of arrangements. When we looked at the cut-off time for debate&mdash;6 o'clock on Thursdays&mdash;we also consulted the airline timetables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were very careful in our original report to put forward proposals for the sitting patterns of the House that would allow members from every capital city except Hobart to return home on Thursday night. Most country people can return home on Thursday night. There are a few people who come from the very outlying states, and from the very outlying parts of those states, and they would have difficulty getting home on a Thursday night. If we brought the time forward, most of those people might get home just a little earlier, but it would not accommodate people who are from places with more difficult transport connections. While there might be some symmetry in the mind of the member for Perth about the committee asking for question time to be brought forward to 2.30 p.m.&mdash;in that that might allow us to finish at 5.30 p.m.&mdash;I do not think that that symmetry was intended, and I doubt whether there would be a change in the time that the government would propose as the start of question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Wakefield says that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) might have caused one of the member for Wakefield's constituents to believe that the life of us all down here is one long lunch hour, and that that is why we have the parliament sit at 3 o'clock. It is not for that purpose. The sitting at 3 o'clock is to accommodate frontbenchers&mdash;ministers from the government side, and opposition frontbenchers&mdash;so that they are able to do things in other parts of this city and on the eastern seaboard during the morning and still get back to participate in question time, which is one of the most important parts&mdash;if not the most important part&mdash;of the parliamentary day. Under the old arrangements of 2 o'clock, that blocked out the day, but 3 o'clock allows people both to do their duty at question time and to be able, often, to see to some political activity in, say, Melbourne, Sydney or the city of Canberra itself. That sort of activity is a far better arrangement for constituents than our being able to finish at 5.30 p.m. on Thursdays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters that the member for Wakefield raised where he thought that we might sit later on a couple of nights of the week so that he and his colleagues can dine with each other.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question whether we should sit late at night is one that a lot of members would not be happy with. What we have in the current sitting pattern is some consistency where people can plan either to dine later at 8.00 p.m. or to go out of the building. It gives people that flexibility, which is what people always demanded. One of the worst aspects of this building in the past was that we were all cooped up in here until 11.00 p.m. each night. We would arrive at 8.30 a.m. and get out at 11.00 p.m., we would go home, go to sleep and come back here at 8.30 the next morning. We never had any contact with the real world. These changes were made to encourage members not just to associate with their colleagues, but also to have the capacity to socialise on a wider sphere in Canberra and to do more human things than to sit around and plot and plan like the old sitting pattern used to encourage people to do. The executives on both sides encouraged this because they do not like backbenchers sitting around plotting and planning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Main Committee was one of the great innovations of the Procedure Committee. Since the Main Committee has come into operation, we have not had to have any guillotines, except in the first week for some roll-over business from the last session. We have had a far greater capacity for members to participate in debate. I do not think there has been any debate on legislation in the House that we have had to truncate since the Main Committee commenced operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget debate this year was probably the best example, with the government wanting to have the budget completed by a particular time and sent to the Senate. Had we not had the Main Committee, we would have had about eight hours less debate on the budget this year than we had. The Main Committee has been very useful for that. Indeed, this morning we are going to discuss this report for about 2 1/2 hours. The reality is that running up to the end of session, if we had not had the Main Committee in operation, we would have had the member for Charlton tabling this report in the House&mdash;we did not even have a tabling speech&mdash;and, with the best endeavour, the government may have got time for half an hour of debate some time this week or next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Main Committee is a singular success in providing opportunities for members of parliament to make contributions to legislation. I take this opportunity to mention the unfortunate demise of the member for Moore (Mr Filing). It is a shame that the opposition did not see fit to leave the member for Moore on the Procedure Committee because it might have been useful to have non-government members other than members of the National Party and members of the Liberal Party represented on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moore, as a Liberal member on the committee, made a very good contribution to the work of the committee. Although this is a decision that the opposition can make, it is unfortunate, to my mind, that the member for Moore is not allowed by the opposition to stay on the committee in the quota of non-government members. However, I place on record the fact that, although I did not agree with some of the things that the member for Moore said, the member for Moore made some very useful contributions to the committee. Some of the points of view of the member for Moore are reflected in this report and in previous reports of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made a suggestion concerning policy statements made by ministers outside the House, and I hope that the government will take up the committee's suggestion. With the way government works and with concerns about timeliness, et cetera, ministers often make important statements outside the house on matters about which members of parliament are very interested. The most significant statement in this regard is the Justice Statement which was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) recently. If these sorts of statements are not made in the House, they are, in a sense, matters unknown to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal of the committee is to the effect that a minister who makes a statement of some significance away from parliament can table the statement in the parliament. The proposal means that a motion can be moved to take note of the statement, the House can find time for it to be debated and members can then make a contribution. Debate on these sorts of papers would probably take place in the Main Committee because the Main Committee provides us with a vehicle in which to deal with such matters. This is a matter that the government could take up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is not proposing that, when a minister tables a paper, the paper be debated there and then in the House. The committee's proposal is to the effect that a minister could come in and table a paper.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to start by paying tribute to the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), as Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, for an excellent job, sometimes under slightly trying circumstances. I allude there to the spirited exchanges sometimes occurring between the honourable member for Watson and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), which do add a little to the time taken by the committee but also add to the understanding of the issues that are involved. I congratulate the honourable member for Charlton and thank my fellow members of the committee for a job that has been well done. I would also mention the committee secretariat, and particularly our secretary, who has done an excellent job&mdash;sometimes under very trying and difficult circumstances indeed. The facility to coalesce a point of view and actually get it down in a few words has been quite outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had not had the opportunity of hearing everybody who has spoken in this debate but I did hear most of what the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) had to say. I must say that I am sorry that he feels inconvenienced in this way but the reality is that you win some and you lose some. It is unfortunate that he finds it difficult living in Perth. We are all responsible for our own choices. I choose to live in the wonderful place called Coffs Harbour, which is subtropical and delightful. That is my choice. If the honourable member for Perth chooses to live in Perth, that it is his choice, and if he cannot stand the heat he should get out of the kitchen. I understand the difficulties he has got. He says that, although he can get home on Thursday night, he gets home late. I cannot get home on Thursday night&mdash;with a 6 o'clock rising I cannot get to Sydney in time to catch the last plane to Coffs Harbour. I am more disadvantaged than the honourable member for Perth, who can get home, albeit fairly late at night. So I have not got a great deal of sympathy with that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member complained also that he has to leave Perth at about 5 o'clock on Sunday evening on 10 Sundays a year. I am surprised that it is only 10&mdash;I thought we sat considerably more than that many weeks. But I also leave home at about 5 o'clock on the Sunday evening because I like to be down here for the Monday morning, to know that I can arrive and will not be blocked out by fog as so often happens in Canberra during the winter. It also gives me the opportunity to attend various committee meetings and get organised for the parliamentary week. So I do not see that as a great problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Perth said that this year on a majority of the Thursday nights we had been sitting late, until 8 o'clock, because the Leader of the Opposition was making statements in response to various things. In actual fact, there have been two occasions this year and I am not aware of any last year when that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member said also that any opposition worth its salt would be moving censures, suspensions of standing orders and so on, and no government business would be done on the Thursday afternoon after question time. The reality is that in the last 18 months, since these new sessional orders came in and we started rising at 6 o'clock, there have been six censure motions. That does not apply to every week. There have also been 16 suspensions of standing orders&mdash;surprisingly, or perhaps not surprisingly when one thinks about it, 10 of those from the government. I imagine the six suspensions of standing orders were the same as for the six censures from the opposition, but the government has had need to suspend standing orders on 10 occasions since the new sessional orders came in. Obviously, it wanted to introduce something or change the order of business. The assertion by the honourable member for Perth that government business on every Thursday is disrupted by the opposition is not an absolutely correct assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do agree with the honourable member for Perth about the airlines' understanding of what happens in this place and the requirements of members and senators. I do not think they have got a clue. He is quite right to suggest that there needs to be a fairly significant improvement in communication between us and the airlines, because they are very significant to our lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about question time. I do not like the 3 o'clock timing of it. The honourable member for Watson has reminded us all of the fact, which I understood already, that the executive&mdash;he mentioned shadow ministers as well but basically it is the ministers&mdash;needs to be able to undertake activities in this city and on the eastern seaboard. Consequently it is much more convenient for the executive to have question time at 3 o'clock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the downside of that is that, by having question time at 3 o'clock, it is never televised live. It is televised at half past 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning. Of course, when the ABC replays it at that time, the audience is fairly limited. It is important that the people of Australia have the opportunity of seeing what is happening in question time. After all, question time is the focus of the parliamentary day. It is the only time that we have the Prime Minister there twice a week. Under the old system, we used to have all ministers present at question time&mdash;the entire shadow ministry still attends&mdash;but there is now a roster for ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question time is the only time, when it is being televised, when the press gallery is in the chamber. The press gallery is half empty on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The press gallery is full on Monday and Thursdays, when the Prime Minister is there and we can expect a bit of fireworks. The public galleries generally tend to be full on the Mondays and Thursdays but are half empty on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. This indicates that the people of Australia believe that the parliamentary focus of the day is question time and that the greatest interest is there when the Prime Minister is present. It is absolutely essential that the Prime Minister is present. The Prime Minister is the leader of this country, no matter what party the Prime Minister leads, and we require that he be there and be available to be asked questions and to, hopefully, answer them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People do not really understand what goes on in question time. Schools come here to go to question time. It used to be very hard to get in but it is much easier these days. Constituents, and particularly children, constantly say, after they have been to question time, `We would not be allowed to act like that at school.' And, of course, they are quite right. However, I tell them that they have to realise that question time is structured in a certain way so as to be very dramatic and very theatrical. It is the focus of the day and oppositions, in the past and in the future, whether us or the present government, have only 30 or 40 seconds in which to ask a question. The government ministers can take five, 10, 15, 20 minutes to answer a question. Mostly they do not answer; they are not in the business of answering questions or providing information. That is one of the shortcomings. I omit the honourable member for Charlton from that criticism because, when he was a minister, he would always answer questions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, question time is very important. It is the focus of the parliamentary day. I am opposed to the rostering of ministers. I believe that the Prime Minister should be there for every question time. It is also important that the people of Australia should be able to see their parliament in action. Question time is the only bit that they get to see, if they are still awake at 12.30 or 1 o'clock in the morning. We should change it, if for no other reason than the convenience of the people of Australia&mdash;not the convenience of ministers. People keep telling me that they would like to see question time but that they do not want to stay up that late to watch it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the proposition that there should be more time for the grievance debate. This is a very significant area, particularly for private members business. I relish the opportunity to speak in the grievance debate and I spoke in the debate this Monday. I would have spoken last Monday but, because of the suspension of standing orders, grievance time was taken up. More time should be allocated for the grievance debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Watson said that the Main Committee is a tremendous step forward and I agree with him. I think it is excellent. It is providing opportunities for members to speak about things that are important to them and even more important to their constituents. I approve of what we are doing. However, the member for Watson said that there had been no guillotine. That is absolutely incorrect. He was correct in saying that we had an additional period of time to debate the budget in the Main Committee. Approximately a day and a half extra debating time was provided in this chamber. We did have the guillotine, there was a cut-off point and we did have the gag, which restricted people's opportunity of speaking. Some members did not get the opportunity to speak on the budget. I happen to know because I was one of them. I was down on the list and, because of the guillotine, even with the gag operating, it was still impossible for me to speak on the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is the most important document and piece of legislation to come before the parliament and I believe every member should be given the opportunity of speaking on it. I also make a suggestion which I made in the committee but which was not incorporated in the report: we should have provision in the Standing Orders for this committee to adjourn on certain occasions and in special circumstances when the Prime Minister of the day is making an important statement. During the last sitting there was an occasion when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was making a major statement and all of us who were involved in the Main Committee operation wanted to be in the House listening to the Prime Minister. As the member for Perth said, it is important that all members have the opportunity to hear major statements, whether they be from the Prime Minister or from the Leader of the Opposition. I appreciate the comment that he made about that. I suggest in future considerations we look at putting in the provision for this committee to adjourn when major statements are being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministerial statements is another area we need to tighten up. Too often many mini-ministerial statements are made in answers to questions. I think that is wrong. I do not point the bone only at the present government. I am sure we did the same thing when we were in government although I would hope that we did not. Ministerial statements should be made as ministerial statements because that then gives members of the parliament representing the people of Australia the opportunity to debate them. Statements can be referred to this chamber and that means there is an opportunity for all of us to have a say on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Watson also mentioned the ministerial statements outside the House and I totally agree that, if this happens&mdash;and I do not believe it should&mdash;they should be tabled in the House so that they can be debated. He mentioned the Justice Statement. I have need of the Justice Statement and only yesterday my staff member was told that we have to buy it from the government bookshop. It is appalling that members of this parliament cannot get hold of such an important parliamentary document as the Justice Statement without having to buy it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Standing Committee on Procedure's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time for review: Bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>. This report is a very worthy additional contribution to the initial reforms that were undertaken as a result of the committee then chaired by the former member for Bonython, Dr Blewett, which I think have very much enhanced the workings of the parliament. I have only been here a relatively short time&mdash;a couple of years&mdash;but I certainly believe that, in general, those reforms have been very positive. In an overall sense, the comments that are in this report under the auspices of the committee now chaired by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) are very worthwhile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a number of the specific themes that are mentioned in the report and add my views to some of the things that have been mentioned by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and some of the previous speakers. Firstly, it is fairly widely recognised that this Main Committee has been a successful innovation within the proceedings of the parliament. The comments in the report indicate that the Main Committee should be continued as an integral part of the process of debate, consideration of reports, legislation and the like. I would certainly endorse that and endorse the comments that the honourable member for Cowper made in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the comments that were made in the report with respect to the public gallery and the need to take steps to encourage visitors to parliament to come and watch the proceedings of the Main Committee as well as the proceedings of the House itself. It is fortunate that the members of the committee did not go into any detail about the types of initiatives that we might want to pursue in that regard: perhaps a hot dog stand or one or two other things might assist. But I think it is important to keep these things in perspective&mdash;that people do come to see the proceedings of the chambers of the parliament for reasons other than just seeing politicians. It is ultimately the base of our democratic system of government and there is a certain symbolism associated with seeing the parliament, in seeing the House of Representatives, which clearly is not replicated within the Main Committee because the Main Committee is simply an adjunct to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we like it or not, I think that this Main Committee will always be something of a poor cousin to the House of Representatives. Therefore we should not concern ourselves unduly with the lack of attendance and the fact that today, in spite of the fact that I am doing my best to make a good contribution, we have only got a couple of people sitting opposite in the seats available for the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to which I wish to advert is the issue of question time. Both the rostering system and the timing of question time are raised in the report. With respect to the timing matter, I am something of an agnostic. I think that the later time of question time is marginally better for backbenchers in terms of the various other obligations that backbenchers have. I really do not have a particularly strong view about the alternative that has been put forward of 2.30 p.m. rather than 3 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do have a couple of views about the question of rostering. One recommendation that is put forward is that the opposition be entitled to demand the presence of one minister at any question time, obviously in order to ensure that, where there is a particular issue running and a particular minister is under pressure, that minister cannot hide behind the fact of not being on a roster on the particular day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is probably a reasonable suggestion, but it needs to be kept in mind that ministers do other things; they do have other responsibilities. Part of the difficulty in pursuing this suggestion is that we would need to ensure that ministers actually had some notice that they were going to be required to attend question time. Otherwise they would not be able to schedule alternative commitments: meetings with delegations, functions and the like. In a sense, the more notice we require the opposition to give a particular minister, the more we defeat the purpose of the exercise in the first place. It then becomes very difficult for the opposition to know two or three days in advance that a particular minister is going to be targeted at a particular question time. Of course, it forces them to telegraph their punches, in a sense, as to what type of theme they are going to be running in question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, it is a worthwhile and constructive suggestion, and I think that the spirit of the suggestion is very logical and fair, but some further work on the detail may be necessary in order to work up an appropriate proposal. I should add that, in a sense, some of the criticisms that are made of the new system of question time by the opposition really only have value because it has failed to make use of the opportunities, by and large, that are offered by the new arrangements. One of the opportunities that is offered by the new arrangements is the ability to concentrate on particular lower profile ministers in more junior ministries, to really give them a hammering and put them under some pressure, to test just how much they are on top of their portfolios and to see whether they are fully across the difficult issues that might be pertinent at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of those opportunities, the opposition, in my observation, has not yet taken that option. It has not been able to make use of that. I think the opposition would find that it would get greater value out of the new question time arrangements if it started to pay a bit more attention to some of the ministers who very rarely get asked questions by the opposition. I think the statistics would show that a large number of ministers have barely been asked a question by the opposition in the time that this parliament has sat&mdash;maybe one or two, but certainly not very many&mdash;and that they tend to rely on government backbenchers to ask questions, to keep them occupied in question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue I refer to is sitting hours. I have some sympathy with the honourable member for Cowper about the question of being able to get home on Thursday night. I am certainly of the view that we should conduct our arrangements in such a way as to enable pretty well all honourable members to get home on Thursday night. To me, the great advance made by the reforms under the Blewett committee was to enable the vast majority of honourable members to get home on Thursday night. It means for me that I can now work a normal Friday rather than wandering around in a semi-comatose state, unable to do much more than sign correspondence and look at things coming across my in-tray. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth pointing out that we have actually saved the taxpayer a bit of money by enabling honourable members to leave on Thursday night, because there is one less day for which people will claim travel allowance. We have also ensured that honourable members are able to spend a slightly greater amount of time with their families, which is ultimately a fairly important question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some sympathy with the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), when he refers to the speeches by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), with respect to the republic and to the budget, which twice now we have had to have on the Thursday night. This has forced honourable members either to delay their return home until the following morning or to go through some rather bizarre travel arrangements in order to get home late on Thursday night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not mind that quite so much if there were any content in what the Leader of the Opposition said in his speeches. Unfortunately, in the one on the republic he took 30 minutes to say what anybody could have said in about three minutes, and his speech on the budget was essentially rhetoric with no specific propositions about alternatives, about what the opposition would do if it were in government. If there were a greater degree of substance in the speeches I would perhaps not quite mind so much, but to stay back to listen to vacuous nonsense is a bit irritating, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say as an observation on this question of sitting times, schedules and so forth that I am an opponent of the parliament sitting more. It is a mistake that people in the community often make, to assume that the only real or important work that parliamentarians do is actually being in parliament and sitting. In fact, it is probably less important than the work that parliamentarians do in their constituency. It would worry me that, if we spent more time here, we of all political persuasions would end up being more remote, less in touch with our electors and less in touch with what is going on at the grassroots level in our electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately what we do, day in, day out, when we are not in parliament, is go around our electorates, be at functions, deal with problems and talk to constituents, delegations and the like. To me that is probably the paramount role of a parliamentarian. Certainly for a backbencher it is the paramount role. To impinge on that for the purposes of longer sittings is wrong. Ultimately it has a undemocratic impact, in that we are less representative of the people who have actually elected us to be here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of parliament is touched on in this report. A commentator a couple of years ago made an observation that parliament in our system is now little more than an electoral college that every two or three years elects an executive and then wallows in irrelevance. I think that is probably being a bit harsh, but there is a certain degree of substance to that. In a sense it reflects the increasing complexity of government. The emergence of parliamentary committees to some extent reflects those changes, so that a lot of the detailed action in consideration of legislation occurs less often in the chambers of parliament than perhaps it once did. So I think we all have a lot of thinking to do&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension, I was making reference to the workings of parliament and its relationship to the executive. One of the things we could look at is how we seem to spend an enormous amount of time debating bills that involve minor, fairly technical amendments to legislation where we have to use the legislation as, in a sense, a heading to enable us to debate broader issues. I suppose there is a necessity for that, but, on some occasions, it also involves the whips of all the major parties asking people to speak and, therefore, to fit themselves into a fairly artificial structure of debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our democracy would be much better suited if we were able to have substantive debates in the parliament on the key issues that face the nation rather than having to modify what we are saying and how we are saying it in order to fit in with, say, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 or whatever the case may be. Obviously, we still need to debate all of those technical amendments to legislation and so forth, but I am sure that we could do that in a much shorter time.

One of the reasons this can cause problems for members&mdash;not that any of us are still likely to be on holidays late in January&mdash;is that I find that to come cold back to work and start sitting straightaway is often a problem. We get a little build-up of work over the Christmas-New Year period that we have to deal with and it is certainly better to be able to have a week or two of working in the electorate office before the House starts sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect the enthusiasm for change&mdash;I am not sure; the chairman might tell me&mdash;is probably greater on the opposition side than it is on the government side. That would probably be the case no matter who was in government or who was in opposition. Plainly, to a large extent the opposition bears the brunt of the government's decisions in respect of these practices. The government simply has the numbers. In the end, the parliament survives, I suppose, largely because of the conventions and a certain amount of goodwill that exists between the two sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues raised in this report that require ongoing consideration. I am sure that that is recommended and that there will be an ongoing process of consideration. I am one who is concerned about question time. I think all of us are: on our side, perhaps for different reasons. It is a pity that question time reflects so badly on us all as members. From our constituents, and particularly from school groups that come here, we all get tarred with the brush that is used in question time, that we are all a mob of louts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I try to explain to people&mdash;I am sure we all do&mdash;that question time is a small part of the day. It is always going to be an active part. It is in the House of Lords; it is in every parliament of the world. I suppose to some extent it gives the opposition a good opportunity to make points, one way or another, in the form of the questions that it asks. In the end, the true purpose of question time ought to be as it is defined, to seek information and to have information provided. I understand that that is its purpose. I think the culture has to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can talk about changing the rules as far as the Speaker's independence is concerned, but in the end there has to be an attitude by the government&mdash;and, hopefully, by us, if we were in government&mdash;that that is the purpose of question time, and that ministers will be required to answer questions and know more. The practice of ministers going off, as they inevitably do, to talk about what the opposition did 10 or 20 years ago, or to make a personal attack on the person who has asked the question, is not the intention. If we were in government, I think we would still find it a temptation to do that, but I am hoping that we would not do so. The chairman of the committee, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has been here a lot longer than I have, and maybe it is a bit unrealistic of me to expect that to happen. The government can tinker with it and put bandaids on it and talk about the Speaker and his role until the cows come home; but, until it gets to the fundamentals, it is really only putting bandaids on it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Procedure Committee has considered in the past whether time limits ought to be applied, and that is another thing that has been done in the Senate. I understand the pros and cons of that; but, on balance, I would probably come down on the side of having time limits applied to answers&mdash;and, indeed, to questions, if one wanted to be even-handed. Obviously, there needs to be more time for the answer than for the question. I would very much like to see question time work better. I understand that it has a volatile atmosphere, and that is good. It is healthy, and it reflects the healthiness of our democracy, but it does not reflect very well on us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the displeasure about politicians is simply because of the fact that people watch question time on television, or they actually come here and watch. In that case, we know&mdash;because we all have the school groups tell us so&mdash;that they are quite aghast at what goes on in question time. I suspect that that is why the government will never sell its proposition&mdash;if we were to come to the point&mdash;that the election of a president should be left to the politicians. All the people I have spoken to, even my friends, say, `Listen, mate: the plain fact is that people will not trust you with that decision. They see the way you behave and they do not want you to be involved in the process.' If there is going to be a president, as the polls have told us, then people are going to want the right&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the report of the Procedure Committee, there are a number of points to touch on. Members need to bear in mind that, as with the first report, this report is a package which we are presenting to the parliament. Some members of the committee have different views from the views expressed in some of the recommendations, but it is give and take. We cannot all have what we want, and this is the problem in relation to hours of sitting and a few other things that I want to speak about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the creation of the Main Committee, the universal view is that the Main Committee is a success. The Main Committee has a different atmosphere from the main chamber, but a lot of constructive work takes place there. The Main Committee is an unqualified success. The sceptics are proved wrong. The Main Committee is one of the beneficial changes that came into being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other beneficial change is standing committees. The House of Representatives committee system provides backbenchers with a meaningful role in the parliament and this situation is as a result of the goodwill between the government and the opposition members on the committees and because these committees operate a little bit differently. Many of the reports which are brought back to the parliament are unanimous reports, and that aspect helps. As Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am in a position to know that that committee has received the bulk of references in terms of advisory reports. If success can be measured in terms of the government picking up recommendations, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has achieved a substantial success rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some controversial pieces of legislation referred to the committee, and the way the legislation has been dealt with is a credit to the cooperation of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples) and the other members of the committee. Proper resourcing of the secretariat and secondment of officers from the department to assist in specialist reports are the keys to the success of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House of Representatives, where the government has the numbers, honourable members have seen the government take up substantial recommendations. This situation has resulted in alterations which enrich the legislation which originates in the House of Representatives. The area of House of Representatives committees is an area in which backbench members of the government and the opposition can play a constructive and positive role in terms of influencing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where I differ from the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) who just rose to speak. Government members in standing committees can express quite differing views from the government's position in terms of the introduction of legislation and achieve success. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4T4">Mr MELHAM</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They can and they have, and the government has accepted it. The culture has changed in terms of the operation of those standing committees in the short time that they have been taking place: they are seen as allowing the participation of members of parliament in the process; they also allow the parliament to bring experts and practitioners in the various fields before it, so that it really is a democratic process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need government and opposition members to resist the push by the Executive for urgent consideration of this legislation. My view has always been that if the legislation that has been introduced by the Executive into the parliament is so crash hot it will withstand scrutiny by members of the parliament and by members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some instances there will be policy differences, and that is when a number of the recommendations may not be taken up. But in the short time that the committees have been operating the parliament has received reports that not only withstand scrutiny but are gaining international recognition. The reports of the legal committee on the child sex tourism bill and the war crimes bill, as I understand it, have been considered model reports, and members of the parliament in New Zealand and other parliaments are using them as a basis of legislation in those countries. I think that says something about the potential for the operation of those committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the underutilised areas of the committees is our ability&mdash;and it is pointed out on page 18 of this report&mdash;pursuant to the standing orders, to examine annual reports of government departments. Parliamentary committees, particularly in the House, need to do that a bit more often because that is another useful mechanism for suggesting change to the Executive. There is nothing wrong with reviewing an annual report of the director of public prosecutions or the ombudsman, for instance, by bringing them before the committee and going through how the legislation might currently be working. The committees could bring forward reports to the Executive suggesting areas of change. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of rostering, there is a comment in this report that there has been criticism of the present roster system. Opposition members of the committee expressed a strong view that the roster should be abandoned, that is, in relation to the roster of ministers for question time. The truth is that there are members of the government who are not well disposed to the rostering system. It is a matter of public record that I was one in caucus who felt that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should be at question time every day. I expressed that view because I believe that he is a master in that forum; that he is the equivalent of what Bradman was to cricket when it comes to question time in the parliament; and that it was absurd to select someone like Bradman in a side as captain and then say that because of his outstanding performances and to even up the score he had better go and sign a few signatures out in the paddock and be used for only part of the time. That is my particular view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What members need to understand, and members of the public as well, is that in politics as in everything else it is the majority view that prevails. The overwhelming view on our side of the parliament is that the roster system has proved beneficial. I think what has happened is that the members of the opposition, quite frankly, have not taken the benefits that they should from the roster. They still need to learn a little about tactics and how to launch an offensive, and this rhetoric about `Yes, we want the Prime Minister back in question time every day'&mdash;</PARA>

We only have to look at the galleries at question time&mdash;both the public gallery and the press gallery&mdash;because when the Prime Minister is not there the galleries are empty. When he is there they are all there, they are all filled. It is an electric atmosphere, it is a charged atmosphere. But that is one where I do not have the numbers. We will still work on it, though.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of the sin-bin is on page 28 of this report. Question time is theatre, and we are all guilty of participating. I suppose the truth is that, in terms of government members, I would probably be one of the more culpable ones in terms of the interchange and in being quite vociferous from the backbench, because I do not believe in sitting idle on the backbench when the members of the opposition are in the fray. There is only one way: we have got to give it back to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are fair dinkum in terms of the operation of the sin-bin and if it is what we want&mdash;total decorum and total silence when a question is asked or when a minister is answering a question or when the Prime Minister is answering a question&mdash;then I say to the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker that they should exercise the sin-bin a lot more harshly and a lot more often than they do. I think that if there were two or three days in succession where the Speaker or Deputy Speaker, whichever is in charge, threw out three or four government members and three or four opposition members&mdash;quite frankly, under the present standing orders that is possible, and I would say that I would probably be the first government member to be thrown out, because I have been given a bit of leniency&mdash;then we would get a question time where we could hear a pin drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But is that what we really want? The truth is that in our heart of hearts most of us do not. I find question time the most engaging and enjoyable part of the operation of the parliament and it is the most electric when the Prime Minister is there. I am not saying that as one who is one of the mates of the Prime Minister&mdash;my views are well known in relation to that. It is a balance. So let us not get on with the humbug. I think the power is there. I actually enjoy the interchange between government and opposition members, but I do believe that there are times when that power should be exercised a bit more. I think that the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker have shown enormous tolerance to us as members of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter, which I will finish with, concerns the hours of sitting. It is well known that, in relation to the sitting hours, I was one of the main architects in the initial report of what has been adopted and is known as the 8 o'clock rule. Frankly, I will defend that until the very end because I think it has enabled us, as members of parliament on both sides will acknowledge, to lead a decent existence in terms of hours. We are not having the situation where we are all walking around this place as zombies late at night. From the point of view of health and quality of debate, and from the support staff's point of view, we have more civilised hours. I am one who will strongly resist the breaking of the 8 o'clock rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that at the end of a session and towards the end of the day we might have to break the 8 o'clock rule or whatever because of the recalcitrant nature of the Senate and the fact that we generally have to wait in relation to it. I think the 8 o'clock rule has been a tremendous success and we should resist any attempt to extend hours on a Monday night, a Tuesday night or a Wednesday night just because we are here. With those comments, I commend the chair in what was a substantial input into this report. He has done a marvellous job.
