<PARA>This proposal, which was referred to the Public Works Committee on 20 October 1994, will partially redress the imbalance in housing available on board compared with ashore by increasing on-board housing from 109 to 152 in accordance with the Defence Housing Authority's mission to provide defence personnel and their families with good housing consistent with community standards. The work will include the provision of an additional 55 houses on new and revised lots, the provision of 45 houses as replacements for existing substandard houses, substantial upgrading or replacement of 10 existing older brick houses and the retention of 27 existing houses which require less substantial work. </PARA>

The committee also made further recommendations to which the Defence Housing Authority responded that it agrees with the need to address the imbalance between on-board and community based housing, and this proposal goes a long way to addressing the imbalance and addressing the needs of naval families in the Mornington Peninsula area. The authority will continue consultation with tenant consultative groups concerning the provision of fixtures and fittings which will enhance the inhabitability of the houses. The issue of double hung windows will be specifically addressed taking into consideration cost implications and the enhanced amenity that this project provides. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill seeks to amend the Child Care Act 1972, the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to facilitate the government's budget 1995 commitment to improve the focus of the children's services program. This will be achieved through two initiatives. Firstly, the government will improve the targeting of financial assistance for families who require child care to enable them to participate in the work force. Secondly, the government will create a more equitable availability of occasional care for families with one or both parents at home. The government will also ensure that available child-care places can be used by families in difficult circumstances, such as family emergencies or for children at risk of abuse and neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government recognises the important contribution to society and the economy of the unpaid work undertaken by women caring for their children at home. The government also acknowledges that the skills of women with work force experience are extremely valuable in an economy dependent on the training and flexibility of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days, many parents will spend some time at home when their children are young and some time in the paid work force. To meet the needs of parents at home caring for children, the government has introduced a comprehensive package of government payments which include family payments, the home child-care allowance, the new maternity allowance and the parenting allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government's policies, work related child care is an economic issue and is an integral part of the government's approach to building a highly skilled and adaptable work force. The expansion of child care over the past decade has been a major achievement of the government and has made the return to the work force a real option for many parents, particularly women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Work related child care is required by parents who are working, studying, training or looking for work. The government has a commitment to meet the anticipated demand for work related care by the year 2001 and is well on the way to meeting the target of 354,000 work related places by 2001, with an interim target of 300,000 places by 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth expenditure on child care has grown from $65 million in 1982-83 to an estimated $1.1 billion in 1995-96. But child care must be affordable for families. The child-care cash rebate was introduced to assist families meet child-care expenses while working, looking for work, studying or training. Over 200,000 families have claimed the child-care cash rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also assists families with the cost of child care through Commonwealth child-care assistance. Child-care assistance is available to families using approved long day care services. About 76 per cent of families using these services receive some assistance with their child-care fees, with over 40 per cent receiving full child-care assistance. As at December 1994, an estimated 222,000 low and middle income families using long day care services received child-care assistance. However, at present, 25 per cent of child-care assistance is paid to families with one or both parents not in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proportion is increasing by about two per cent each year due to the increasing use of substantial periods of occasional care in the long day care sector by families with a parent outside the work force. Occasional care makes up about 20 per cent of all hours of care in the long day care sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent surveys indicate that many working families cannot gain access to the care they need. The surveys also show that some families use substantial amounts of occasional care, while many others have no access to child care at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's clearer targeting of child-care assistance will ensure that families who need child care to enable work force participation get priority to places. The amendments contained in this bill will assist by revising child-care assistance arrangements consistent with the work related focus of the program. These measures will provide access to care for an estimated additional 31,000 families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1995 budget, the government also announced that the assessment of a family's eligibility for child-care assistance and family payments will be streamlined. This will be achieved by having the Department of Social Security assess eligibility for both payments at the same time each year using a common definition of income from October 1995. This initiative is designed to make the assessment process easier for families by enabling families to provide information applicable to both schemes on the same application form at the same time.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the government's aim to increase the availability of care for parents who need child care to participate in the work force, the Department of Social Security and the Health Insurance Commission will verify the work related status of any family wishing to receive priority of access to a child-care place for work related reasons. Amendments are required to enable the Health Insurance Commission to assist families, at their request, with evidence of their work related status, for the purposes of gaining priority of access to Commonwealth funded long day child-care services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 are included in this bill which will enable:</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;the Department of Social Security to collect information and assess a family's entitlement for child-care assistance on the basis of work status; and</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;the Health Insurance Commission to verify the work related status of those parents who are not currently claiming or are not eligible for the child-care cash rebate to assist them in gaining priority of access to a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. </PARA>
<PARA>I now move to the detail of the amendments required to the individual acts. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Child Care Act 1972</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current priority of access guidelines require long day child-care services to give priority of access for vacant places to parents who need child care for work related reasons. However, the implementation of this arrangement is highly variable and a significant number of child-care places are being used by families who do not require the care to enable them to participate in the work force. As a result, in some areas, families who need care for work related reasons are unable to access child care. In addition, many services and industry organisations have agreed that government departments should introduce a way of verifying the work related status of parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to address these concerns, these amendments include provisions to assess a family's entitlement to child-care assistance not only on the basis of economic need but also on the basis of the work related status of the family or other special circumstances such as children at risk of abuse or neglect or emergency situations. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also includes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. These amendments will enable the minister to make guidelines for the purpose of administering sections 29 to 31 of the act which define work related commitments. These guidelines will clearly set out the requirements of families who are verifying work, study or training commitments and will make the process of verification of work related status more transparent. Decisions made under these guidelines will be reviewable. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also contains amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 which will give the Health Insurance Commission the power to verify the work related status of families at their request. As part of the government's initiative to better target child-care places to families who require child care to enable them to participate in the work force, the Health Insurance Commission will verify the work related status of any families who request it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many families will be able to verify their work related status by producing a recent child-care cash rebate receipt as evidence that they receive the child-care cash rebate and therefore have already verified their work related status. The Health Insurance Commission already has the power to verify a family's work related status as part of the child-care cash rebate scheme under the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a small number of families who are not eligible for, or currently claiming, the child-care cash rebate and who may choose to verify their work related status with the Health Insurance Commission, independent of the child-care cash rebate program scheme. These amendments will allow these families to gain priority of access to Commonwealth funded long day child-care services. In order to confer on the commission the function of verifying the work related status of this group of families, it is necessary to amend the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Changes to Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time there may be a need for the Health Insurance Commission to clarify or confirm information about a family's composition or its work related status with a department of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. This may occur if the information contained in a family's work verification document from the Health Insurance Commission is not sufficient to allow the service director, who is assessing priority of access to a child-care place, or the Department of Social Security, which assesses eligibility for child-care assistance, to properly identify the family concerned. Examples of circumstances where this may be necessary include where a family changes its address, where there is a change of partner or surname for a member of the family or where a family misplaces its work verification document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, in order to obviate the need for families to seek further documentary confirmation from the Health Insurance Commission, amendments in this bill to both the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 and the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 will allow the Health Insurance Commission to verify information about a family's composition and work related status directly with either the Department of Social Security or a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. The Health Insurance Commission will be able to provide this information only with the consent of the parent concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Commission will set out administrative procedures which must be followed before any information about a family will be verified directly with the Department of Social Security or a child-care service. These administrative procedures will conform with the requirements of the Privacy Commissioner and will be authorised by the Minister for Family Services, to ensure that the privacy of personal family information is protected in accordance with the principles set down in the Privacy Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this government's support for choice in child care is clear and unambiguous. The government supports the choices parents make in either caring for their own children or placing their children in the care of others. The government has introduced a comprehensive range of payments which provide an independent income for parents who choose to care for their children at home. The government has provided, and will continue to provide, funding for new child-care places, innovative child-care programs and services for children and families with special needs. Child-care funding will continue to grow from an estimated $894 million in 1994-95 to $1.1 billion in 1995-96, and is expected to reach $1.5 billion in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care provides parents with options to balance their work and family responsibilities. The amendments sought in this bill will help to ensure that the children's services program is better targeted to families with parents in the work force and that available places used by families with a parent outside the work force are spread more equitably. Through this initiative, 31,000 more families will have access to child care in the long day care sector. These amendments will ensure that the significant growth planned for the children's services program is properly directed and sustainable. I commend this bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition opposes the Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill. I have never heard a more dishonest second reading speech than the one we have just heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous). I do not think his speech contained one sentence to indicate what the substance of this legislation is. The specific measure that this legislation is designed to introduce was not mentioned by the parliamentary secretary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to implement decisions announced in the 1995 budget, in particular the decision to restrict eligibility for child-care assistance for parents not in the paid work force to 12 hours per week&mdash;a statement we will not find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of the parliamentary secretary's speech. That decision to restrict eligibility for child-care assistance for parents not in the paid work force to 12 hours per week shows the government at its worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth commenting upon the language that was used here in the parliamentary secretary's speech. After the completion of the International Year of the Family, in the children's services program area, apparently we still have a complete disregard for one of the major conclusions of the National Council for the International Year of the Family&mdash;that is, that parents at home caring for children are working; that they should properly be described as `not in the paid work force'. Instead, the department continues to use the language that those parents are not working and that child care utilised by parents who are not in the paid work force is child care utilised for non-work related reasons. So we have the distinction continually drawn in this speech between work related and non-work related care&mdash;a distinction which a great many parents in this community would deeply resent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a clear broken promise reneging on a commitment by the government, which has been repeated on many occasions, to regard child care as a right and not a privilege. It shows the complete lack of impact of the minister responsible in this area, Senator Crowley. She has meekly capitulated to the demands that she offer up savings in child care to pay for the extravagance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). She then has had the parliamentary secretary placed in the embarrassing position of delivering to this House a speech which deliberately sets out to obfuscate what the government is intending to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation, the government is ignoring the role of the child-care sector in early childhood and preschool education&mdash;a most important role which has developed. The Commonwealth may not like it, and it may have walked into this situation with its eyes closed, but the fact is that the child-care sector funded by the Commonwealth is increasingly becoming a preschool sector. It is a sector focused on early childhood development and education. It provides services which are absolutely indistinguishable from preschool level services offered by the traditional kindergartens funded by the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has now become a very significant funder of preschool education. Now the government has the nerve to come into this House and tell the Australian people that it intends to discriminate against families&mdash;in terms of access to that sector&mdash;which have one parent at home caring for the child. Families with both parents in the paid work force will continue to have access to this early childhood developmental and preschool sector&mdash;the Commonwealth funded sector&mdash;but families with a parent at home will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What possible rationale could there be for that restriction? This entirely arbitrary decision which the government is proposing reflects the fact that the government has no national strategy for the development of child care. There is no national framework for the development of child care in Australia at the present time. The providers of child care and the parents accessing child care have absolutely no idea what the government intends for the future of this sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arbitrary decision, which has simply been plucked out of the air at the last moment to meet the budgetary problems caused by the Prime Minister's extravagance last year, is going to impact exceedingly unfairly and unjustly on parents around Australia. It is a decision which will fall particularly harshly on low income families, who will simply not be able to afford to purchase the additional hours at full cost over and above the 12-hour limit which the government proposes to place on child-care assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an uncommon thing for the decisions of this government to impact very harshly on the lower income sections of the community. I think it is now generally accepted throughout Australia that, over the 13 years of this government, the gap between the rich and the poor in Australia has widened. We see in the legislation yet another decision of this government which is socially unjust and inequitable and which will hit the lower income families of this country particularly hard. They will be the ones who will be unable to afford the additional hours over and above the 12-hour limit which the government intends to impose, even though the parliamentary secretary did not deign to say in his second reading speech that that was the purpose of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say that this piece of legislation is a clear broken promise to those providers of child care who have invested heavily in the industry on the basis of the existing policy. The government and the Prime Minister have come into this House and told us on numerous occasions how many additional child-care places have been created. The way the Prime Minister talks, one would think that the government had created these places, but the vast bulk of these new places in child care have been created by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in the private sector, overwhelmingly small business people, have mortgaged their houses, invested their savings and taken out loans in order to establish these child-care centres and additional child-care places&mdash;for the Prime Minister to boast about them in the parliament. Without any consultation with them and without any consideration of the impact of this policy, the government now comes into the House and kicks them where it hurts. It is a slap in the face for these people. The justifications which are offered and the assessment of the consequences of this decision in the speech made by the parliamentary secretary&mdash;I sympathise with him because he has not had any input into this speech; it has just been handed to him&mdash;bear no relationship to the consequences that this decision will have in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that there is a shortage of child-care places for what the government chooses to call in its politically extremely incorrect language `work related' care. There is a shortage of places for work related care. Throughout large sections of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and in Queensland, there are child-care centres with vacancies&mdash;hundreds of child-care centres whose viability is dependent on their being able to offer care to parents who, for the most part, are caring for their children at home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is now saying to these centres, `You may no longer offer care to these families beyond the 12-hour limit for which we will offer child-care assistance' without these families having to pay the full cost themselves. The impact of this will be very serious. The Australian Federation of Child Care Associations has already stated its belief that, as a result of these decisions, many thousands of workers in child care will be laid off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that this decision will push a great many child-care centres&mdash;small businesses which have invested money on the government's promises&mdash;to the edge of and into bankruptcy. There is going to be a very difficult period before these people, who have relied on the Prime Minister's word, finally suffer the full consequences of this decision. During this period, I have no doubt that many of these centres will seek to save themselves and their investments by putting up fees for parents who are in the paid work force and who are still able to access fee relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision will increase the unaffordability of child care for many parents who are in the paid work force, smashing the promise that the government has reiterated on many occasions up until now that access to child care is a right for all parents whether they are in the paid work force or not. This is an outrageous decision that again shows the lack of grasp and understanding of what is happening in the child-care sector on the part of the government at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands of families in Australia have organised their family lives to take account of the availability of child care, and there are many good reasons why they may wish to do so: people want to engage in community work; they are caring for aged parents; they are seeking to make a contribution to their communities; they perceive what the government apparently very unwillingly perceives, or does not see at all&mdash;that is, they have access to an increasingly high quality preschool sector which offers their children many services which would otherwise be completely unavailable to them. These parents are going to be damaged by this decision. It is not likely that they will regard this government, with yet another broken promise, as one which merits their continuing support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reading speech there is a lot of cant&mdash;that child care must be affordable to families, that there will be additional places and that this is all about a more equitable distribution of occasional care. Tell those small businesses which have believed the government's rhetoric until now and have invested in this sector that there are many families out there in the community waiting to come in and utilise the occasional care opportunities in the long day care sector where there are presently vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just rubbish. It is nothing more than an attempt to rationalise a decision which has been taken at the behest of the Prime Minister to give his budget a semblance of credibility over the long term. The savings from this budget item in 1995-96 will be only of the order of $2.8 million. Down the track the Prime Minister wants to be able to say that there are significant savings here&mdash;and there will be as centres close and as parents are shut out by this very unjust and arbitrary decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why 12 hours? How was this figure plucked out of the air? According to the government, it has something to do with the median usage. What about all those families which have utilised more than the median usage? Was there any consultation with the child-care sector to discover whether or not this was a feasible and commercially sensible restriction to place, given the fact that the private child-care sector generally has not offered sessional care? How are these sectors going to make use of the hours which are not used on days where children are placed with them accessing fee relief under this provision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a decision which again shows that the government simply has not followed the development of this sector nor understood it. It is not surprising that the government has not understood it, because it has broken the commitments that the minister gave in the past that a properly representative industry council would be established. The fact is that the government does not have access to any satisfactory consultative mechanism with what is now the largest sector in the provision of long day care&mdash;the private sector. The government has no way now of satisfactorily accessing information from that sector. I know that those member representatives of that sector who have sought, as most have, to work cooperatively with the government have become increasingly dismayed at the lack of reality and the lack of balance in the advice which the government is getting for the development of its child-care policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a decision which is going to impinge much more widely. It will impinge right across the long day care sector. It will affect community based long day care centres as it will affect the private sector long day care centres. It is a decision which has been designed to get the government out of the financial difficulties which its own budgetary mismanagement has caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions are going to impact more severely in some parts of Australia than in others, simply because the private sector has developed more rapidly in some parts of Australia than others.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look at some of the more detailed aspects of this bill. It contains amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, the Child Care Rebate Act 1983 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. The effect of these amendments is to change the eligibility for child-care assistance in long day care services to 12 hours per week. For families using long day care for work related reasons, to use the government's language, or for families with both parents in the paid work force or other exceptional circumstances, this limit does not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide for an independent administrative mechanism to assess a family's work related status for the purpose of gaining priority of access to a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service. Amendments to the Child Care Act 1972 in this bill allow a family's entitlement to child-care assistance to be assessed not only on the basis of economic need but also on the basis of the status of the family in relation to paid employment or other special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministerial guidelines will determine the special circumstances to be covered, which may include, for example, children at risk of abuse or neglect, emergency situations, and families with a parent who, for medical or other exceptional reasons, is unable to meet the specified work related criteria. The amendments also enable the minister to make guidelines which will set out the process for determining whether a family does have work related circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes proposed for the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 will enable the minister to make guidelines which will assist the Health Insurance Commission in administering sections 29 to 31 of the act, which define work related commitments for the purposes of claiming the child-care cash rebate. These guidelines are to clearly set out the procedures and evidence required to verify a family's work, study or training commitments, and purport to make the process of verification of work related status more transparent. As the parliamentary secretary said, the decisions made under these guidelines are to be reviewable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 will enable families to have their work related status assessed independently of child-care services. This is apparently to allow service providers to use this information in assessing priority for places in long day child-care services. The Health Insurance Commission will be able to provide this independent assessment of work related status for families who have not had their work related status verified either by the commission under the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 for the purposes of claiming the child-care cash rebate, or by the Department of Social Security under section 12A of the Child Care Act 1972 for child-care assistance purposes. Decisions made in relation to a family's work related status under the Health Insurance Commission Act are reviewable under the review provisions of the Child Care Rebate Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act and the Child Care Rebate Act will allow the commission to clarify or confirm information about a family's composition or their work related status with a department of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth funded long day child-care service with the written consent of a parental member of the family concerned. This may occur, for example, if the information contained in the family's work related verification document from the Health Insurance Commission is not sufficient to allow the service director or the Department of Social Security, which assesses eligibility for child-care assistance, to be clear that it applies to a particular family. These amendments purport to obviate the need for families to seek further documentary conformation from the commission. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child-care assistance is a scheme designed to help low and middle income families with child-care fees. The assistance is provided to families by the government and administered through service providers. It is in concept a payment to the parents rather than the service providers. It is available on a tapering scale until the family income reaches $1,157 per week before tax for a family with one child in care. Child-care assistance is available to eligible families using approved child-care services, including community based, employer sponsored and private long day care centres, family day care, outside school hours care and occasional care. To be approved for child-care assistance, long day care centres must now comply with accreditation guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child-care assistance was made available to parents using private child-care providers in 1991 by the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. Until then it was only available to parents whose children were in community based child-care centres. The purpose of extending fee relief to private centres at that time was to increase the supply of child-care places and ensure that child care was affordable for `ordinary Australian families', which was the expression former Senator Button used in his second reading speech on the Community Services and Health Legislation Bill on 11 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley, in debate on the appropriation bills on 21 May 1990, stated that the goal of making this extension was to `bring on stream a significant increase in the number of places for people who are still looking for access to child care'. Senator Crowley also recognised at that time that child care was important for families and particularly women `who want to exercise their opportunities to study, to work and to do a whole variety of things that previously they were not able to do without that child-care assistance'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill on 17 October 1990, Senator Crowley spoke of the challenge which all government senators, and herself in particular, faced in grappling with the proposal to change party policy to extend `public dollars to the private sector in child care'.

No evidence has been brought forward to show that this is the case. It is very interesting that the government has not proposed any particular measure in this legislation which specifically addresses that issue, if indeed it is an issue. Instead, it has chosen a measure which will impact very broadly on parents and providers right across the long day care sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the problem is that the priority of access guidelines are not being observed, why has the government not brought forward measures to deal with that particular problem? If you talk, as I have, very broadly with people in the community based and private long day care sectors, you will know that there is a very proper recognition of the existence of the priority of access guidelines. Until now, under those guidelines, long day care centres have been entitled to provide places for what the government calls non-work related care and to make fee relief available for parents using those places on an unrestricted basis&mdash;indeed on the same basis as fee relief is made available to parents who are in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a very significant reneging on past commitments. It shows that the government no longer has credibility in terms of child-care policy, that many of its past statements were not made seriously and that they are now being broken with a very wilful sense that this sector is another of the pawns in the community which must suffer to try to save the Prime Minister's bacon with the financial markets. It is only a matter of appearance in the next year, but it is going to impact very harshly and unjustly once this restriction comes into place in April next year. </PARA>

Our credibility in this area is without question. We have strongly committed ourselves to the right of parents to access to child care in the Australian community. Now that the government has seen fit to renege on its commitments we will certainly be doing everything in our power to make sure that the community is aware of the hypocrisy, lack of planning and injustice which underlie the government's current approach in this area. </PARA>

We just heard the member for Goldstein talk about credibility and the opposition's commitment to child care. I remind him, in case he has forgotten, that members of the opposition in the previous parliament did not seem to understand that child care existed.

They had to have Fightback II to exempt food and child-care services from the GST.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As usual with great changes in social policy and social reform, the Labor Party has led the way and the coalition has dragged about 10 years behind again. That was shown very clearly in the last federal election campaign and is still being shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes amendments to the Child Care Act 1972, the Child Care Rebate Act 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. In the recent budget the government announced its intention to improve the targeting of child care to families who require child care to enable them to participate in the work force. There are two initiatives which will assist in this improved targeting. Under the first of these, from 1 April next year, a family's entitlement to financial assistance with its child-care fees through child-care assistance, which was formerly known as fee relief, will be assessed on the economic need of the family as it currently is and on the work related status of the parents. Families in which both parents&mdash;or, in the case of a single parent, the sole parent&mdash;are working, training, studying or looking for work will be entitled to child-care assistance for as many hours of work related child care as they require or as many hours as are available to meet their work related commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that because it seems that yesterday and particularly this morning I have been getting a lot of calls in my electorate office and here about this bill. There is obviously a bit of a scare campaign going on in the community. Private child-care centres in particular seem to think there is something dreadful about this legislation and are being stirred up by some disinformation from places that we can only guess at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate office has received lots of calls, as has the office of my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). Our electorates cover areas where there are a lot of young families and child care is a very important issue. It is an issue that is recognised by this government and has been for the last 12 years. Obviously in our electorates it is a high priority issue and there is concern in the community. But the concern is based, I think, on myths and disinformation. I will be certainly contacting the child-care centres in my electorate to inform them of the correct position in relation to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to point out that the definition of a `working parent' applies to not just someone who is at work at the moment. It also applies to parents looking for work. Whether they are on unemployment benefits, whether they are training or whether they are studying, they are still considered as part of the labour force, the work force, and they are therefore still eligible for these child-care assistance benefits. That is the situation, although it is not quite reflected in one of the letters I have received. I will read part of a letter from the Rosemeadow Preschool. It is a form letter that has gone out to all the parents whose children are minded at this particular preschool. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear parent,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is planning to restrict child-care assistance to 12 hours a week for children if one of the parents is not working. This means that children of parents who are unemployed, a non-working single parent or only one of the parents are working will be restricted virtually to only one day a week.</PARA>
<PARA>That is simply not the case. If people are unemployed and looking for work, they are considered to be part of the labour force. I think that is one myth that needs to be knocked on the head straightaway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the initiatives I was talking about is that all families wishing to receive first priority of access to a child-care place will have to provide independent evidence of their work related status to their child-care provider. That is simply a monitoring of the eligibility of parents under the child-care legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition there will be some exceptional circumstances, such as children at risk of abuse or neglect or short-term family emergencies, where a family will also be entitled to child-care assistance for as many hours of care as are required or available. Exemptions are also being considered for families with children or parents with a disability. As has always been the case under the priority of access guidelines, children at risk are covered for child-care assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to listen to opposition members talk about child care. Suddenly, with an election coming up, they can see an opportunity to stir up in the community a bit of disinformation and a bit of concern about child care. But the hypocrisy from the opposition in relation to child care is almost on a par with the hypocrisy that we heard yesterday about the French tests. It is the Labor Party that has always led the way with these great social reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to child care and the children's services program, unlike in the past where the government's involvement in child care was simply seen as a welfare circumstance issue, under this Labor government child care has been recognised as not only a social issue but a very important economic issue as well. The priority of access guidelines are designed so that priority in Commonwealth funded child-care centres is given to working parents. That is how it is intended to be. That does not mean that we do not fund occasional care. Of course, occasional care is funded. The limit is 12 hours a week, as set out in this bill. I point out that in relation to occasional care the 12 hours a week is an increase. Until now the limit for occasional care has been as low as four hours a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 April 1996 families with both parents at home will be able to claim child-care assistance for up to 12 hours a week, which is equivalent to up to three developmental sessions a week. I have heard some concern expressed about the 12-hour limit, but it is a fact that at least half of the families currently accessing occasional care use fewer than 12 hours a week and 20 per cent of the remainder use a very small amount more than 12 hours a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The supposed impact on parents of this 12-hour limit is fairly minimal. In fact, from evidence I have received as a result of calls to my office, it seems that those who are mainly concerned about this bill are not the parents but the private child-care centres that can perhaps see some effect on their profits. Of course, private child care is an important part of the child-care industry. It was this government that opened up fee relief, or child-care assistance, to the private sector. The private child-care industry in my electorate has grown dramatically, which has catered for the very high level of need for child care in a growing area like Macarthur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to look at priority of access guidelines and it is important that they be adhered to. It is also important for governments&mdash;in terms of policy, legislation and funding&mdash;to provide benefits for those people in most need. It has been drawn to my attention that there are occasions when private child-care centres seem to charge the clients&mdash;the parents of the children&mdash;for 12 hours a week of care when the hours of care are actually fewer. Perhaps this legislation is a worry for those centres which see their ability to cream off some profits at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is responsible. It is yet another  example of this government's commitment to child care and social justice. I might take this opportunity to go over the history of the child-care program. It is one of our important programs. It is not only an important social program but also an important economic issue. It is worth recounting the record of this particular government on child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Formal child-care services in Australia had their origins in the need to provide substitute care for children to allow mothers with young children&mdash;this is, of course, the original need for child care&mdash;to work in workplaces structured around the needs of men. That is how the need for child care originated in the 1960s. Before the 1970s, child care was considered to belong in the private sphere as the primary responsibility of mothers. Perhaps the opposition still believes that should be the case. Judging by its policies on other issues, I would not be surprised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some charitable groups did provide a small amount of child care as a welfare service. However, these programs carried a strong stigma, as children were considered disadvantaged by the substitute care being provided. With changing social attitudes and growing workplace participation of women, the traditional view of children being dependent on purely home based care began to change. The federal government became involved in child care in the early 1970s mainly through the provision of preschool education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1972 the Whitlam government was elected on its promise of a year of preschool education for every child. The government opened up new possibilities with direct action on the establishment of new services and the implementation of parent control and community management. However, during the years of the Fraser government, the children's services program diminished. The Fraser government clearly viewed its involvement in children's services in terms of welfare responsibility for needy families, and the overall decline in real funding for children's services reflected the philosophical attitude of that government at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current federal Labor government, child-care policies have been transformed by moving them into the mainstream of social and economic policy making. Rather than considering children's services as essentially a welfare program, this Labor government has recognised child care as an important economic issue as well as an important social issue. Child-care places are seen as necessary to meet the demands of the labour market with child-care subsidies becoming an  important part of the social wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very important point to stress. I always seem to follow the member for Goldstein in these debates. He is the shadow minister for employment. One would have thought that he would have been aware that child care is a very important labour market issue. He would certainly be aware that that is the priority of this government, as it should be. I am surprised&mdash;perhaps I should not really be surprised&mdash;that he seems to have missed the whole point in the child-care debate. Child care is an important part of the social wage and an important part of our labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To meet these objectives the federal government entered into cost sharing arrangements with the states and territories. This proposal was initially suggested by the New South Wales Labor government in the 1980s. It offered to contribute the capital child-care costs as long as the government provided the recurrent funding. This idea spread to other states, and in the 1980s the children's services program expanded quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been problems with some of these Commonwealth-state child-care arrangements. I have spoken many times in this House before about the fact that for nearly five years the former coalition government of New South Wales did not sign the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement, first drafted in 1990. This was despite many valiant attempts by the federal government to enable the young families of New South Wales to have access to the children's services program and to much needed child-care places, whether they be long day care, occasional care, out of school hours care&mdash;you name it. The people of New South Wales were being denied access to the new places available because of the political gamesmanship and the point scoring of the former New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took a change of government in New South Wales this year for the agreement to be signed in April. There are also similar problems in Victoria. With the change of government down there, it took almost as long for the agreement to be signed by the Kennett government. There have been problems with these Commonwealth-state child-care agreements, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria. There always seem to be problems with agreements between the Commonwealth and the states, but that is a debate for another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government currently directs funds to and administers the child-care assistance, which we have been talking about, for long day care and family day care centres. It is a means tested fee assistance scheme. It also provides the child-care cash rebate for working families. It provides out of school hours care, operational assistance and fee assistance, although some states also have an administrative role in that. We fund occasional child care and, as I have said, long day care as well. We also have a range of other initiatives including the supplementary services program. We have now in place a quality improvement and accreditation system, QIAS, which is another recent initiative of this federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government provides contributions to the capital costs of new community based long day care centres in most states and territories.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reiterate an important message for parents: this is not as bad as the opposition and some people in the private child-care industry are making it out to be.

It shows the hypocrisy of those opposite&mdash;a bit like their jumping on the bandwagon yesterday over the French nuclear testing. The needs of non-working parents in the home, although they do not have access to the unlimited fee relief as working parents do, are met by a number of other social security benefits such as the family allowance payments and, in some cases, the child-care cash rebate. </PARA>

As far as I can gather, having listened to some of the debate so far, nobody has touched on the critical element of this debate&mdash;that is, the arbitrary setting of 12 hours per week fee relief or assisted child care for non-working parents. Anybody who has had anything to do with child-care facilities would realise that that is not sufficient for two full sessions. A number of different organisations in my electorate have made representations to me highlighting the fact that 12 hours assistance would not provide two days long day care for people in this situation. It might provide 1 1/2 days of care, but it will not provide two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight to the government and the departmental people present that the representations I have received from providers in my electorate are to change that arbitrary figure of 12 hours of long day care per week to two days. That will certainly help provide a much better service to the target group. The target group is the priority 4 group&mdash;that is, single income families, non-working families, isolated families, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and non-English speaking migrant families. They are the families that are affected by this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) say in his second reading speech that with this measure 31,000 additional families would have access to assistance. By the same token, it must eliminate thousands of families from accessing long day care services around Australia. The figures in the budget provide for an anticipated saving over four years of $151 million. You cannot save $151 million by providing more child care. You save $151 million by providing less child care. It is important to get these facts on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the House, I do not speak in this debate without any background or credentials in this area. I have three children of my own, two of whom over their early years attended long day child-care centres in Taree and Wingham.

I was part of the inaugural council committee that established these two centres. After a couple of years of operation, and when they were well established in the community and providing a good service, the management of those two community based day care centres was passed over to a community based management committee which I chaired for a number of years.

It is a publicly owned long day care centre which operates with Commonwealth funds and which is managed by a community management committee. Geraldine Smith's concern is with that arbitrary figure of 12 hours per week, which I mentioned earlier. It is not two sessions or two days; it is 12 hours.

They recognise that there may be a need for the government to tighten up in this area, but it is not being done in a way that will be beneficial to the people who need the service; that is, the priority 4 group, which includes single income families, non-working families, isolated families, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and non-English speaking migrant families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people from whom I have had representations operate centres in my area, which has a 17 per cent rate of unemployment. It is not 8.5 per cent, which is the rate across the country and the figure the government is projecting for the end of this financial year, but 17 per cent. These people will be disadvantaged by this move by the government. These are genuine concerns which are being expressed by people who are genuinely providing a much needed service in my area. These are not just political points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that these concerns are coming from the grassroots level. I presume that the department and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), in formulating this measure, have consulted not just with the razor gang but also with the providers and the people in the community who represent the people who use these services. The background notes read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Childcare Assistance is a scheme designed to help low and middle income families with child care fees. The assistance is provided to families by the Government and administered through service providers. It is in concept a payment to the parents rather than the service providers.</PARA>
<PARA>Government speakers have highlighted that the people jumping up and down are the service providers, but I do not think there is too much scope for making large profits in this area. In getting out of the system people who should not be receiving assistance, an income test is applied. Some might argue that it is too generous. It cuts out at a gross income level of $1,157 per week. Then you get no fee relief at all. Maybe that is too generous. Maybe that needs reviewing. That comes out at a gross combined income of about $60,000 a year. There is a noted saving in the budget papers of $151 million. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the Auditor-General in the report Mind the Children (June 1994), the amount of growth exceeded Departmental estimates. Over the period 1991-1993, the total number of subsidised places for all service types grew from 168,000 to 208,000&mdash;a 24% increase. As a result of the trend to part-time care where more than one child uses a place, the Department estimated that approximately 343,000 children use those 208,000 places. Of this number, some 219,500 (64%) received Childcare Assistance. The estimate for expenditure for Childcare Assistance in 1995-96 is $745.1m, and in 1997-98, $989.0m.</PARA>
<PARA>Maybe this area of government expenditure is growing faster than was estimated by the government and it is using this measure, with that saving of $151 million it is making, to try to keep the lid on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to child-care services has always been something which the government has crowed about. I reiterate that the government does not have a mortgage on all the right views on child-care provision in Australia. There are many other people in the community who also have objective and correct views. But the stated objective of the child services program is to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force and the general community by ensuring that child care is affordable for lower middle income families and by approving the supply and quality of child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other stated objective of the children's services program does not make a distinction between work related and non-work related care. The Commonwealth's support for work related care stems from its obligations under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and ILO Convention 156, workers and family responsibilities. The Auditor-General pointed to a substantial demand for non-work related care, and a census of child-care services shows that substantial use of long day care and family day care is made for care which is non-work related. About 20 per cent of child-care assistance is paid to parents using non-work related care. They are the government's words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has stated that access to non-work related care is not equitable, as it depends on the availability of places rather than on the demand for care&mdash;and the government has made little formal commitment to meet the demand for this type of care.

<PARA>It is a very important point that I make with regard to this piece of legislation. It is interesting to note a comment that was made. I spoke on the phone this morning to one of the directors of one of these day care centres about the waiting lists and whether this sort of attention needs to be focused on this group that uses occasional care and long day care centres. The largest waiting list in my area is in the nought to ones. The director to whom I spoke does not believe that the government wants to cut this area down because of pressure from the area on the services provided. We are saying from this side of the House that this is being driven by the need of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to balance the budget. He has gone through all the departments. My perception is that the minister with responsibility in this area was told to find some money to save&mdash;and she has found $151 million by cutting back on this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not about creating better equity. The Auditor-General has said that there is no equity. He stated that access to non-work related care is not equitable as it depends on the availability of places rather than on the demand for care. The government has made little formal commitment to meet the demand for this type of care. Access to non-work related care is restricted by supply and, in many cases, is restricted to families and areas with an oversupply of places. Now the government is prepared to provide only 12 hours of non-work related child care a week to people in that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements decisions announced in the 1995 budget. Those decisions were quickly picked up by people in the industry providing the care. The decision to restrict eligibility for child-care assistance for parents not in the paid work force to 12 hours per week has aroused great concern&mdash;as I have highlighted&mdash;particularly in the private sector of the child-care industry. The community based child-care sector will also be affected by the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had derision from the government, because it has been the private providers who have predominantly raised this issue. The government has said that the private providers are in it for the money. The Commonwealth of Australia could not provide the infrastructure to provide the child care that a lot of the private sector does. The private sector has to be involved in this industry; otherwise there would not be the same amount of child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point in government members saying, `Private providers are only looking after themselves and feathering their own nest.' The Commonwealth could not supply the capital to provide the infrastructure the private sector has established in providing these places. The government's argument is fallacious and should not be used. The private sector has provided these places&mdash;and the government is using the private sector to provide the places&mdash;so it should not use that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector is saying, `We are happy with these restrictions, provided they are limited to two days, not 12 hours. The government should put a two-day limit on this focus group in this area, not a 12-hour limit.' That is all the private sector is saying. If it were trying to maintain its bank balances, profitability and viability, it would be opposing the idea outright. Its criticisms are constructive. It is constructively making a suggestion to the government and the bureaucracy involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will close on that note. Hopefully, the government will look at my comments as being constructive and not entirely political. The industry is genuinely concerned about the measures that the government is implementing in this bill. The criticism that is being levelled at the government is constructive, not negative, and is aimed at finding a proper way to provide the long day care that is needed for this target group. It is about being reasonable and realistic in how that care is provided. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing matters more to my electorate than affordable access to quality child care. Child care is in the first rank of equity issues facing the people of Werriwa. My representative role in this matter is to argue the case for equity. In child care, this also means arguing the case for change and pursuing the policies of social attack which, in this instance, involves mustering arguments for a better way of running the national child-care program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Care Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 reinforces the need for a genuine equity approach to social policy. As I have previously argued in the House on aspects of health, housing and local government policy, this approach should not be seen as incompatible with market parameters or the virtues of market analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with the child-care debate in Australia is the absence of accurate measures and parameters by which child-care programs can be assessed for their satisfaction of socioeconomic needs. This makes an important point for policy makers interested in social equity, for policy makers driven by the need for a more equal society: never allow social policy to be taken over by special interest groups; never allow social policy objectives to drift away from a hard-nosed, rigorous approach to equity; and never allow equity itself to be redefined in terms other than those which address the satisfaction of socioeconomic needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lessons are compelling. In public life and public administration, practical outcomes matter much more than social theory; and, most of all, equity cannot be judged and measured without attention to issues of price, distribution and the supply and demand for services. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate to talk of an active market for child-care services in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand this market&mdash;to assess its strengths and weaknesses&mdash;it is instructive for the House to note its similarity with the provision of health care services in Australia: first, a confusing and overlapping set of federal, state and local government responsibilities, with active incentives for cost shifting; second, different funding and pricing mechanisms determined not by the capacity of service providers to satisfy social needs but by their ownership; third, the inability of funding mechanisms to address the changing nature of locational needs and regional equity&mdash;that is, the absence of regional sensitivities in the funding formulas&mdash;and, fourth, market conditions of surplus demand, inadequate supply and, consequently, the forced rationing of service delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four ways in which child-care services are being rationed in Australia. The first form of rationing is the priority system for access to community long day care. Incredibly, this system ranks the needs of working parents higher than those of children with physical or intellectual disabilities. I would urge the minister and her advisers to reverse these priorities to give the highest priority to disabled children who most need public support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second form of rationing is a shortage of long day care for nought- to two-year-olds. This is because child-care assistance and the cash rebate are not being adjusted for the cost differential in the provision of care for nought- to two-year-old children by private sector centres. It costs more to provide the care with staffing ratios for nought- to two-year-olds than for three- to five-year-olds, but the flat fee being applied takes no account of that differential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third form of rationing is the waiting lists for most types of care in many, but not all, parts of Australia. This legislation, of course, forms the fourth element of the process of rationing by attempting to limit child-care assistance for non-work related child care to 12 hours per week, with a budgetary saving of $141 million over four years. This reform responds to the 1993-94 Australian National Audit Office report which found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-work related care is costing the national program $80 million a year. Children with no additional needs (purely respite) are costing approximately $60 million.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an attempt through this legislation to ration publicly subsidised care for home based parents and their children. I have no problem with that objective in theory. I just have a concern, which is shared by other members, about the way in which the theory is being applied in practice, because it does not take account of regional differences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the seat of Werriwa has the youngest population in the country. It has a high proportion of single parents as a family type. It has a high proportion of non-English speaking background communities. It has an unacceptable proportion of unemployment and other forms of social welfare. In Werriwa there is currently, according to some private centre providers, an oversupply of long day care for three- to five-year-olds. The real service need in Werriwa in long day care is not for three- to five-year-olds; it is for nought- to two-year-olds, and also in non-work related care arrangements. This legislation reinforces the need for a regional approach to the distribution of scarce resources in the Australian child-care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the minister not only to address the need for regional sensitivities but also to look at the practical application of this legislation, because the provision of two sets of six hours&mdash;two days and six hours of care each day&mdash;does not correspond to the way in which private centres have structured their fee arrangements. Private centres charge on a daily basis, not hourly. If the legislation passes the Senate, there will also be a need to give those centres the flexibility to adjust their staffing arrangements to staff up at the peak period, which may be for a six-hour duration. So some reforms will flow out of the legislation&mdash;assuming its passage in the Senate. I urge the minister to address those questions: to have a daily provision instead of an hourly provision and to provide better staffing and industrial relations flexibility for child-care centres to meet the way in which non-work related care is being rationed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, the rationing of non-work related care makes sense. If home based parents were to abuse the system by placing their children in child care, at government expense, for the entire week and not pick up their responsibilities as parents, then that is something the government should try to actively discourage. That much makes sense in this legislation. It is just that we also need to have regard to regional sensitivities and the practical application of the 12-hour rationed period. The minister must have regard for the practical circumstances in which most of the private child-care centres in my electorate find themselves in 1995 and, consequently, some of the adverse reactions they have expressed on the administrative consequences of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to examine the significance of rationing of child care around Australia. In any market for social products where demand far outruns supply, governments are forced into decisions about the distribution of services and benefits. The success of this rationing role depends on the establishment of funding and pricing mechanisms which meet two objectives: first, responsiveness to consumer preferences, particularly on a regional basis, because the regional differences around Australia in child-care needs are quite acute; and, secondly, regard for socioeconomic needs&mdash;that is, the equity arguments that I am presenting to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of rationing makes a very important point about some of the arguments for universality that child-care lobbyists present to the government and around the community. Universality in child care, like Medicare, would basically require a special levy on those taxpayers with children, or the devotion of large amounts of government revenue to the child-care sector. Presently in Australia&mdash;and it is reflected in the policies of both the government and the opposition&mdash;that premium on child care is not being presented. In Australia we lack the social premium required for universality of child-care provision and, as a consequence, we get the rationing of care in the four methods I have outlined to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It logically follows that it is not valid to argue that child care can be regarded as a work related expense equivalent to current tax deductions. It would be valid in practice only if the service were to be provided universally, because this is what distinguishes all the other forms of work related tax deductions: they are universally provided in the market and there is a match between supply and demand. Work related clothes or work related equipment are easily supplied within the consumer market, but we do not have that level of universal provision in child care. There is a rationing system in place. Child care has had to be rationed as demand has far outrun supply around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this fashion those that I would term the `Coxocrats' are coming unstuck. People like Eva Cox seek to use the child-care debate as a form of gender struggle, arguing that men are always advantaged by working no matter the quality of that work, and women are always disadvantaged by home based work and activity. In truth and practice, child-care policy should seek to facilitate choice and accommodate diversity among family types and family values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public policy should not seek to satisfy the stereotypes of either the Coxocrats or the conservatives; rather, within the limits of equity and efficiency, it should assist families to pursue the lifestyle and the child-care arrangements which best suit their particular circumstances and family aspirations. Child care should not be seen as a zero sum game where the sexes, males and females, are forced to contest scarce resources; rather, it should involve the satisfaction of family needs whereby males and females alike enjoy benefits, and their children enjoy quality care and better opportunities for early childhood education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is invariably argued that Australia's children's services are organised in a complex fashion because the needs of children and families are complex. This represents a form of reverse logic in public administration. If, as is the case, the needs of children and families are complex and diverse, then the role of government is simple and twofold: first, to maximise choice between child-care types and service providers, whereby families are free to satisfy their own needs instead of having ideologically driven solutions imposed on them by central planners; and, second, to establish an efficient system of safety net provision through capitation payments and well-targeted operational and capital contracts to assist socioeconomically disadvantaged families and regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is crystal clear. Universality in child care is very expensive and in Australia it is currently well beyond the public's willingness to pay through the taxation system and the public sector. We lack the social premium which would underscore a universal approach to child-care service provision in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It logically follows that, if rationing is to apply, government transfer payments should be means tested, plus service subsidies should be allocated on a needs basis. For instance, if the child-care cash rebate were to be means tested in line with the basic family payment, $40 million per annum would be saved. If the home child-care allowance were to be means tested at the level of the basic family payment, there would be a saving to the public sector of $145 million per annum. The result would free up total savings of $185 million each year, which could be reallocated to areas of greatest social need. If we are going to have rationing in the child-care system, I am a strong supporter of taking the resources presently being allocated to high income earners in Australia and reallocating them on a regional and service need basis to areas of highest socioeconomic need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle that follows from these arguments is to present the benefits and payments in a fashion which establishes competitive neutrality between public and private child-care service providers; that is, to have endorsement of the COAG principles for competitive neutrality and to apply them to the child-care sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this fashion, the government could use its capitation payments, the child-care assistance and cash rebate, as basic entitlements, as the foundation of a system whereby service providers, public and private, would have an equal opportunity to provide basic care. That equal opportunity is presently distorted by the failure of the subsidies to reflect the higher cost of care for nought- to two-year-olds in the private sector. In the public sector, the community long day care centres receive government capital and operational subsidies which allow them to meet those higher costs. The private sector is not receiving the same level of government support. I urge the minister to address that basic inequity and basic source of inefficiency in the child-care system and establish the sort of competitive neutrality principles which have been so thoroughly endorsed by COAG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle flowing from these questions of rationing is the government using capital and operational subsidies to address locational differences and inequities in child care around Australia. With competitive neutrality, once the private sector and the public sector have done their best to provide services and if there are still shortages and gaps in service provision on a regional or locational scale, the government should target, to public and private sector providers, its capital and operational subsidies to meet those shortages and fill those gaps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that some of these issues are currently on the agenda of COAG and I look forward to the establishment of a purchaser-provider split with regional funding arrangements, suitable performance measures and national standards all built into a reformed national child-care program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reinforce the regional differences. In Campbelltown, which forms the bulk of my electorate, family incomes are not as high as in other parts of Sydney, so there is a need for public sector support. The electorate of Werriwa, as I have mentioned, has the highest number of young children in Australia. There is currently a waiting list for child care of over 2,000, mostly in the nought- to two-year-old sector. There is also a requirement for more out of school hours care. Werriwa has a high proportion of single parents and, as I have mentioned, an unacceptable level of unemployment. The percentage of single parent families as compared with all family types is 13.5. That is the fifth highest percentage of the 147 federal electorates. This shows the need for more occasional child care to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would make a lot of sense for national child-care programs to take account of these regional circumstances. I draw to the attention of the House one of the problems. I refer the House to the answer to question No. 1247 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. The minister has responded, in terms of government allocations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . socioeconomic status is not used in arriving at recommendations on areas to be targeted for new places. Places are allocated according to levels of unmet demand in an area.</PARA>
<PARA>This creates a unique problem in Sydney. Because of expensive land prices on the North Shore, private sector operators have been more likely to provide their services in the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney. Because the government, federal and state, has a criterion for the allocation of operational and capital resources meeting unmet demand, too high a proportion of public support is going to meet the unmet demand on Sydney's North Shore and not enough of it is coming to electorates such as mine. There is a need to build in regional sensitivities and a hard-nosed, rigorous approach to equity with funding formulas based on socioeconomic need. Scrap the reliance solely on unmet demand and make sure that the funding formulas address basic needs in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of the planning system. I am not a strong supporter of the planning system. The Australian National Audit Office report 1993-94 made some valid points about the need for competitive neutrality. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the expertise of community-based and private services in providing good quality and cost-effective services should be shared more effectively. Private services and community-based services have more similarities than they have differences in the ways they operate, their user groups, their staff and their concern for children. The current divisions between them are quite clearly counter-productive for the development and delivery of quality, cost-effective services.</PARA>
<PARA>With competitive neutrality there would be a diminished requirement for government to undertake planning. In any case it is very hard to effectively central plan a child-care system. Family needs are dynamic. Family needs are changing all the time, as are family values in response to our dynamic industrial relations system, employment, transformation of social values in the 1990s, changes in technology and transport arrangements. So how can a central bureaucracy second-guess family needs? It is much better to use basic pricing and market signals to respond to those family and consumer needs and then for governments to allocate capital and operating subsidies to both public and private providers to fill the gaps left by the private sector. </PARA>

Almost 19 per cent of Australian children under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner; that is, approximately 700,000 children in a family with no breadwinner. One-quarter of all Australian families have no working member; that is, almost 1.15 million Australian families do not have a working member. One in eight families is falling below the poverty line. Poverty is increasing in almost every group, except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line&mdash;a rise of 14 per cent since 1983 when the Labor government came to power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forty-four per cent of Australia's single parent families live in poverty. I guess a lot of them would be in the member for Werriwa's electorate. I say to him that if he feels so strongly about the government not performing with this legislation he should think about crossing the floor when the vote comes and supporting the case that he has put forward in this chamber. The bottom line is that the Labor government is again proving it has no idea about child care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, as he entered the chamber, scoffed. It does not have any idea about child care. The government has got it wrong. It thinks child care is a work related exercise and a work related expense. It applies child care to any work related issue: if parents are working it is okay for them to get some child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that currently there are two styles of child care being paid. One is the child-care cash rebate which is paid under the health system. The other is the home child-care allowance which is paid under the social welfare system. It is paid to a parent who is looking after children at home. Anyone who says that that is a non-working position obviously is not at home with children. Parents who stay at home with children are considered as being on social welfare, whereas parents who work through choice have their child care treated as a work related expense. There seems to be some inequity about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There does not seem to be any recognition by this government of parents who choose to stay at home and care for their children at home. They put a lot of emphasis on child care when it comes to work related expenses. It is time that the community and members of parliament took a different and non-political view to this issue that is affecting the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example. I was talking recently to a woman who works for two days a week at the Burswood Casino. She works for the casino in a supervisory capacity on weekends. I said, `What do you do?' She said, `I work at the casino.' I said, `Hang on. You told me you worked two days at the casino. How come you say you are working for the casino? Surely for the other five days you are caring for your family and your children.' She said, `I prefer to say I work for the casino because it saves a lot of trouble trying to explain myself and I have a higher regard for myself if I say that I work.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, mentioned Eva Cox, who won an award recently. We congratulate her for that. I remind the House that Eva Cox is the convener of the Women's Economic Think Tank. She is the social policy analyst and spokeswoman for the New South Wales Women's Electoral Lobby. She recently said on the ABC radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the people who benefit from having a woman at home is the man, not the community, not necessarily the children. I mean, it's very nice to have time off with your kids. . . . but it is not something which has any clear public benefit, it's a private benefit, and it ought to be seen as such.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have someone in the community who is well regarded for some of the things she says stating that there was no clear benefit in looking after your children at home. The former speaker, the member for Werriwa, said that he did not disagree with that position. I certainly do not disagree with that position. I think those people who take the line that child care at home has no benefit at all should not be considered as putting forward a substantial argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real answer in child care is to provide choice. People should have the right to choose child-care services whether they care for their children at home or go back to work. This legislation will reduce the opportunity for choice. As the previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, said, this legislation is really a bit draconian in some areas and it is not regionalised enough. I am not too sure where the seat of the member for Werriwa is but a similar seat, the seat of Cook&mdash;also an older electorate&mdash;has child-care centres closing down through lack of children coming along. It does not need the child-care centres, yet the seat of Werriwa has quite a long waiting list in the zero- to two-year-old category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the whole issue of child care needs review. It seems that we are making bandaid attempts to overcome the growing public disquiet about this issue in the community. I do not think the government has got it right with its policy. It is trying to bandaid a few things. It made policy decisions on the run at the last election, and it has been found out because these measures are not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that it is the welfare of children that we should be concerned about&mdash;not necessarily the welfare of child-care centres, of those in the child-care industry and of those who are parents. The real issue here is the welfare of children. We should be giving parents the opportunity to make a choice. It does not seem as though many children have been considered in any of the recent legislation about child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that one of the results that may come from this legislation is that fees will rise. People ask, `How come fees will rise when the argument put forward by the government is that more places will be available?' That may be so in some regional centres like Werriwa and Campbelltown but in other areas, such as those in the seat of Cook, where there are current vacancies, child-care centres will need to raise their fees to cover their overheads. I do not know whether the government is listening to those within the industry. Because fees will increase and fewer people may be attending some of these child-care centres, unfortunately there is an opportunity for loss of jobs and maybe centres will have to close. Maybe it is time we started looking at our regional development program when it comes to child care, as suggested by the member for Werriwa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe this legislation will hit low income families. It may be that we are trying to help low income families by making more places available, but if fees increase how will low income families be able to afford the increased fees? One has to consider that. This may be put off in an offhand way by saying, `Hang on a second. It won't happen that way,' but we know from other legislation that we do not necessarily give proper consideration to everything and these things do happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested by some members that the legislation is a cynical exercise to save some money over the next couple of years. I think $151 million will be saved over about the next four years. It may be a budget saving exercise&mdash;$2 million will be saved in the next 12 months&mdash;but it was interesting to listen to the member for Werriwa suggest how other savings could be achieved. He predicts that by simply means testing the child-care cash rebate there could be a $40 million saving in 12 months in that particular area. The member also suggested that, by applying a means test to the home child-care allowance, which I am not supporting, based upon the family allowance principles, the total savings would be $200 million each year&mdash;much more than the $151 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this debate has shown these measures to be a bit of a cynical exercise. I believe this is just a cost saving exercise. It is a bandaid attempt to try to move into the child-care area. I do not think the government is listening to parents who are in the child-care area, especially those who are choosing to stay at home to look after their children, and it is also not listening to industry people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is fairly typical of the government's lack of listening in a lot of areas. The member for Werriwa also said that there was not much planning involved in this whole process. I again agree with him. A lot more planning has to be done in this child-care area, because what we are seeing is an approach to child care that does not really take into consideration the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude my remarks by talking about the Labor myths about social policy and social welfare. This government says that it is the only government that applies social policy. I think it is actually losing this particular child-care debate, because this is a sleeper issue for it in some areas. I think it will be a sleeper issue for it in the marginal seat areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in a marginal seat like Cowan child care is a very relevant issue. I believe a lot of parents in my electorate are not getting proper consideration from the government with a lot of their child-care issues. I also believe that those who choose to look after their children at home are being ignored and their pleas for consideration are being ignored by the government. I do not believe the government is listening enough to the community when it comes to child care. It is certainly not listening to the industry, to the recommendation the industry is putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just another example of dealing with figures. The government always goes for the solution rather than address the problem. It always tries to fix a problem by throwing money at it rather than by going to the actual cause of it. I believe it is time the government showed some direction. It had better do that if it wants to stay in government, because child care is a real sleeper issue in many marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line here is the importance to Australia of families and of their future. I read out before the figures on unemployed families. Almost 19 per cent of Australia's children under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner, and 44 per cent of Australia's single parent families live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that has been ignored for too long in Australia. We have to address the needs of our children. Children are the future of our country. For some unknown reason, Australia is not like European countries, which really look after their children. They consider children a huge asset, yet, for some unknown reason, our culture and system seem to neglect children in a lot of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those important areas is child care. I believe we should be giving more consideration to those parents who choose to look after their children at home. We currently do not do that. We favour too much the parents who choose to move back into the work force&mdash;and quite rightly so, if they have to&mdash;in the way we pay the child-care cash rebate. We do not give those families assistance through the health system but pay the home child-care allowance through the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to address the care of our children. If the Labor government does not, it will suffer at the next election because most of these child-care areas are in marginal seats. Those who make these policy decisions always seem to be the ones in safe seats and they do not seem to consider marginal seats very much. I look forward to some proper consideration, as suggested by the member for Werriwa, in future child-care issues. I hope the government addresses these child-care issues shortly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes available to me before the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) winds up, I would like to add a few thoughts of my own over and above those mentioned by previous speakers. We can firstly get all the cant and humbug out of this. This is not about child care in the strict sense of the word. What the government is doing is trying to limit non-work related child care. This issue has nothing to do with equity, as the parliamentary secretary said in his speech, but has everything to do with the government trying to save $151 million over a four-year period after having created an expectation that it cannot fulfil. Over the period from 1991 to 1993, the number of subsidised places for all service types of child care grew from 168,000 to 208,000, or an increase of 24 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this trend to part-time care, where more than one child uses a place, 343 children were using these 208 places, and 64 per cent of those received child care. While I accept the priority of access principles that have been outlined by speakers today, this debate has not taken into account that a number of providers have made a large capital investment on the basis of the government's stated policy. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bevis" NAMEID="ET4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KV5">Mr NEVILLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, because you have created an expectation. Ex-Senator Button, who has been quoted extensively in this debate today, has said that child care is a right not a privilege of all children, and yet this is the government's move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary will know that, when these private centres were created, most of this sort of care was being delivered by community based organisations. The chance of the government providing its agenda through this system was quite remote. The government has relied very heavily on private providers to put a framework in place that effectively would take the heat off it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of capital investment in child-care centres in my area. I would like to quote a letter to Senator Crowley which was written by one of my providers, Samantha Hawes, who runs the Pied Piper child-care centres. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write to you today&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is mid-June&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">after much thought about the proposed Budget initiative of your Government, of the above mentioned topic.</PARA>
<PARA>That topic is child-care assistance cutbacks. She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a Licensee of a long daycare centre in south east Queensland in the town of Bundaberg. I would like to ask you where your Government and Department has come up with the figures to back your proposals, to cut back the amount of hours to non-working MOTHERS in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I run a beautiful new purpose built centre with fully trained and dedicated staff. If these cutbacks come in I will have to retrench 5 or 6 full time staff and as you would be aware, Bundaberg has an extremely <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">high</EMPHASIS> unemployment level. This will only help to increase that, along with the large amount of Mothers who will in turn be forced to register for job search allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government put it out to the private sector to provide these purpose built facilities to meet the needs of the whole community, not just the two (2) income families you are now aiming at. The Labour Government has put this new proposal out to the community in such a way that they will believe you are increasing, the amount of places to be available to working Mothers. We don't need 31,000 new daycare places.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may have been so at the time of the last census, but things have changed in the three years leading to today. It is my belief that children from a low and some an exceptionally low economic background, need to come to long day care centres so that they may start schooling life on a level playing field along with their peers. A lot of these children come from homes where <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">self-esteem</EMPHASIS> is non existent and facilities are poor and finances pushed.</PARA>
<PARA>She then goes on in the letter to talk about perhaps having a different income test level and paying a different percentage of the fees that were available to eligible parents. The point I am trying to make here is that, in reducing the number of places that will effectively be at these day care centres, you are altering the entire structure of their economies of scale. Far from solving the problem, you might find in some areas&mdash;and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) touched on regional plans&mdash;that day care will increase for those remaining in the centres from up to $3 or $4 per child per day. That becomes quite counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise from the parliamentary secretary's gesticulations that he wishes to wind up this debate, but I appreciate the opportunity to speak for those centres that have provided a valuable service thus far. I do not think the government has thought through well enough the consequences of its actions. </PARA>

Firstly, I will deal with some of the issues raised by the member for Goldstein. The member for Goldstein seems to make all kinds of speeches nowadays on social policy. He not only attacks the government on the specifics but also attacks the government by making claims about poverty and social policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that this is the same honourable gentleman who was one of the stalwarts of the New Right during his academic years and his earlier years in politics. This honourable gentleman proposed the vicious cuts in social programs which have been the hallmark of the Thatcher Right type regime. For this honourable gentleman to then come in here and talk about social policy and welfare is quite unbelievable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member parades this claim that there is more poverty in Australia now. He has not bothered, as a former academic, to study the research. You can put that sort of proposition to people who have not studied the matter, but I remind you that I am an expert in this matter and I have written a book on it. If you had studied that book you would not be making these ludicrous assertions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Goldstein tried to claim that we were trying to keep secret certain matters relating to child care simply because those issues were not referred to in the second reading speech. Did the member for Goldstein read the explanatory memorandum? In case he did not read the explanatory memorandum, I will read what it says at the second paragraph. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments change the eligibility for Childcare Assistance for occasional care in long day child care services to 12 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the claim that the government was trying to hide the measure. It is in the explanatory memorandum and, obviously, in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to his claim that the figure of 12 hours is arbitrary and discriminatory. The figure of 12 hours per week was responsibly determined. It is the median of current child-care usage for families with a parent at home. What the members of the opposition who keep repeating these claims fail to mention is that for some families this measure will mean an increase in subsidised child care. At present, families with a parent at home using Commonwealth funded occasional services are eligible for only four hours of subsidised care. With this change, those families will be entitled to an increase in care of up to 12 hours&mdash;that is, an increase from four hours to 12 hours. So much for the claim by the honourable member. This will be of benefit to many women who use occasional care services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Goldstein claims that the government discriminates against women at home. What rubbish. This government brought in the home child-care allowance which makes sure that the primary carer at home has an independent income. We also recognise that while these families choose to care for their children at home full time they do require some child care, particularly for preschoolers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we done? We have given an allowance to everyone: we have given an allowance to those people who are working and we have given an allowance to those people who have one parent at home, which we have supplemented in relation to preschool arrangements. That is what we have done. In every case we have looked after people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider that these claims are coming from the Liberal Party, which did nothing for child care in the seven years that it was in government, this is an absurdity. I remind the House of the figures I mentioned previously. Child-care expenditure has increased from $65 million in 1982-83 to an estimated $1.1 billion, or $1,100 million in 1995-96, under our regime. Yet we hear these ludicrous claims by the member opposite that not enough has been done. As if those opposite would do enough. These are the same people who election after election come in and propose massive cuts to the budget. Those opposite never actually spell out where the massive cuts are going to come from or, if they do bother to do that, as did the former Leader of the Opposition, the Australian people throw them out; they do not want anything to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that it is a nonsense for those opposite to come in here and criticise our child-care record, which is a proud record and which is a marvellous record in terms of increases and real support for people who need child care. If the honourable member for Goldstein is seriously interested in further increases in this area, he should abandon some of his previous economic strategies and talk about how we are going to fund those increases. He should not talk about cutting taxes or preventing taxes that can pay for these services, as those opposite are doing. The government's budget measures will ensure that limited occasional care for families is more equitably spread. So let me just reject that argument from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite also claim that there is little demand for work related care. We have had an amazing array of arguments on this issue from those opposite. On the one hand, they say, `Yes, there are significant demands nationally; there's an undersupply of child-care positions.'  On the other hand, the member for Goldstein says, `Hundreds of child-care centres are closing because they don't have enough demand.' I challenge you to produce the figures to back up your claim that hundreds of centres are closing. That is a nonsense; that is a false claim. The reality is that there may be some areas where there is an oversupply but, in general terms, there is still a significant demand. This government is the only government that has tried to meet that demand in a proper and responsible fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have presented arguments about child-care centres. There may be some specific child-care centres in which there are problems. Why do you not bring those specific problems to the attention of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) instead of coming into this House and trying to pretend that there is a general problem throughout the nation? When you were talking on the Gold Coast, you said, `There's an oversupply of child-care places on the Gold Coast, but nationally there's an undersupply.' If there is an undersupply nationally, then why do you claim that hundreds of centres are not able to be maintained? The reality is that you have no facts to back up your claims. But this is typical of you. Whenever you come into this House, you do not present an argument based on the facts; you present an argument based on your ideological predilections in relation to attacking the government&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You should go and get an education; you might learn what it means. What we need to make clear is that the government's priority is to assist families that require long day care services so that people can work, study, train and look for work. There is also some occasional care for families with a parent at home. They are the priorities of the government. Those priorities are directed precisely to deal with the issue which the member for Goldstein accuses us of not dealing with. Those families that are most disadvantaged and those families that require an additional second income and have to go out into the work force will be able to get that benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me repeat: those poorest families are the ones receiving the benefit. So what is the member for Goldstein talking about when he tries to claim that poorer families are disadvantaged by these changes? On the contrary, they are advantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at factual claims, the member for Lyne, for example, said that the unemployed would suffer under this initiative. He failed to understand that the definition of `work' in this bill, and in all the child-care bills, includes unemployed people who are looking for work. So his claim that the unemployed would not benefit from these changes is mistaken. This is typical of the kinds of arguments which we get from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude with this. Normally there are some opposition members or shadow ministers, such as the shadow minister for health and human resources, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who can discuss and negotiate these changes and who are interested in progressing these matters on a bipartisan basis. I challenge the member for Goldstein to start discussing with me and the ministers ways in which we can get progressive legislation through this House and not have a situation&mdash;such as the one we are going to have&mdash;where those opposite, for no real reason, will call for a division and oppose this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reject the arguments of those opposite. Furthermore, we want the Australian people to note that they are opposing an important additional measure in child care. This is not the first time they have opposed child-care measures. However, they then have the cheek to get up and say, `There's not enough being done in child care.' Without the Australian Labor Party, without the Australian Labor government, particularly if those opposite had been in government, there would be nothing like the availability of child care of the sort we have in this country now. The reality is that those opposite have produced no arguments. This bill ought to be supported by the House. </PARA>

A good deal of that military activity that goes on between our two countries relates to maritime surveillance in the South Pacific. It is not only in this country's interests but also in the interests of those countries in the South Pacific&mdash;that will, regrettably, be very badly affected most likely by the French nuclear tests&mdash;for that maritime surveillance function to continue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I have seen comments of the kind he alluded to in his question; they were made by the Leader of the Opposition in his address in this House on the budget. He said that the assertion that public spending and taxation in Australia are low by OECD standards is irrelevant, given the size of our current account problem and our proximity to the Asia-Pacific region, and that our competitors in this regard are the low taxed OECD countries such as the USA and Japan as well as the tigers of Asia. That was a comment by the Leader of the Opposition about low tax. In this way he sought to deflect the very appropriate argument coming from the government that, in the context of a budget which had some tax measures, we still have a very low level of taxation by the levels of OECD countries in general&mdash;in fact we are at the very bottom level of OECD countries. The opposition leader is saying that we need to have tax levels which are comparable to those of the USA, Japan and the Asian tigers.</PARA></TALK.START>

Japan and the USA are with us, at around 30 per cent&mdash;ours was 29.9 per cent for 1994-95&mdash;but the Asian tigers range from 11 per cent to 20 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition says that we need to have comparability with this group of countries. If they thought this through, it means we would need to reduce the tax to GDP ratio by nine per cent of GDP, to 21 per cent&mdash;a cut of about $44 billion. This was said by the Leader of the Opposition in making his formal speech on behalf of the supposedly alternative government in this House in reply to the budget. I find this an extraordinary statement to make. A cut of $44 billion is what he implied.

I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that Telstra has, as a member of a consortium, been successful in bidding for the right to build and operate telephone networks in central Java, which was the most sought after of the five regional opportunities that were opened up by the Indonesian government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Vietnam where it has been very successful since 1986. The reason we were encouraging the company to invest in countries in the region is that we believe that investments by Telstra would lay the foundation for future dividend streams that generate foreign exchange earnings for Australia. The reason why we have been encouraging Telstra to look at the region is that the World Bank has estimated that if you just look at the investment between now and the end of the decade in switching and transmission of this industry, the World Bank estimates that this business is worth $170 billion between now and the end of the decade. So we think there are tremendous opportunities. We are very pleased that Telstra, as part of the MGTI consortium, has been successful in this particular region, in central Java.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The population covered by this region extends to 33 million Indonesians. In this region at the moment only one in 100 people has a telephone in their home compared with Australia where 49 in 100 people have telephones in their homes. That is why we think this region offers tremendous opportunity. It has a high population, great economic growth and great opportunities for generating export earnings for Australia in years to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is Telstra involved in Indonesia and Vietnam, but later this month Telstra will commission its digital mobile network in Calcutta. I had the privilege a few weeks ago to open Telstra's new office in Beijing where it already has a memorandum of understanding with a company known as China Unicom, which has the exclusive right from the Chinese government to compete with the ministry of post and telecommunications in China. Australia in the last 100 years has built nine million telephone lines throughout the whole of the country whereas in China last year alone 19 million new telephone lines were installed. So you can see the tremendous opportunities that are in other regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just in developing these networks where there are opportunities. We have been very pleased with the export performance of the communications equipment manufacturers. We have 13,000 Australians already working in this industry. We have seen exports grow from $50 million a year a decade ago to $850 million a year at the moment. It is great to see companies such as Siemens which recently got an order for $245 million for developing digital switching equipment and Alcatel which has recently signed a contract worth almost $50 million to supply and install the new under sea fibre optic link between Jakarta and Surabaja.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By introducing domestic competition, by encouraging more competition at home, we have encouraged Telstra to improve its efficiency, to look for investment opportunities in Asia, and we have seen the export of equipment grow from $50 million to $850 million. But if you look at this tremendous performance by the equipment manufacturers and by Telstra in Australia, you have to ask yourself what happens if the Leader of the Opposition has his way and sells off Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Leader of the Opposition has his way and Telstra is in large part owned by foreign telephone companies, you have to ask the question of how much interest Telstra will be allowed to have in Asia and how much interest will our equipment manufacturers be able to have, following on the tails of Telstra into the region. You have to ask the question whether or not Telstra will be allowed to grow into that telecommunications hub that can offer Australia those export opportunities in future times. That is the reason why this government remains committed to these aims, and that is why we will stand by them.</PARA>

We are continuing to import capital goods, which will be beneficial to our future investment and to employment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that some of that increase is probably due to the devaluation of the Australian dollar, which is having some impact on import prices. But there is probably also some volume effect in that as well.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen some such reports relating to some suggested changes to the superannuation proposals that were outlined by the government in the budget. These suggestions are coming from a group of organisations&mdash;consumer, welfare and some women's groups. I must say I found these criticisms and suggestions to be quite disappointing because they fail to apparently understand the full importance of what is in the government's proposals. They particularly seem to have scant regard for the importance of improving national savings, which was a key element of what was involved. They also, in suggesting that there is considerable inequity in what we are proposing, I think misunderstand seriously the nature of those proposals. I might briefly allude to those two issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to savings, of course a key part of the budget was improving national savings so as to be less reliant on foreign savings not just in relation to the budget outcome but also in relation to superannuation. The new measures on top of what was already there in terms of the superannuation guarantee we expect to considerably enhance private savings. These new measures are expected to increase savings by one per cent of GDP by the year 2005 and 1.7 per cent by the year 2020. On top of what was already there to make that a four per cent increase, these are very substantial improvements to our national savings performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is suggested by these groups would mean that those savings improvements would simply not be achieved. The suggestion that we should abandon the government contribution and the current tax concessions and have a standard rebate would certainly mean far less money in superannuation funds and a far lesser impact on national savings and would simply change the nature of the way in which we provide concessions for superannuation. It certainly would mean a much less substantive retirement income scheme and far less improvement to national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the proposal to allow people to access their superannuation savings for a host of objectives, including housing but various other things as well, would also punch great holes in the savings objective. That is clearly not something which the government believes is appropriate. If we want to get the benefit of improved savings, obviously we have to ensure that what is put away for retirement is in fact put away for retirement and not able to be accessed for these other purposes. Therefore, I think the groups have got it all wrong in relation to savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to equity, obviously what the government was doing with the government contribution was providing a much more equitable way of delivering the second round of the One Nation tax cuts by providing them in a way which gave benefits to people earning under $21,000, who previously were going to get nothing, providing maximum benefits at the level of around average weekly earnings and providing no benefits at all to high income earners. This is a very considerable improvement in equity of income distribution and also in the way the superannuation system works. In that respect I think the comments of the groups are quite disappointing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These groups also seem to misunderstand the fact that our superannuation scheme is built on top of our continued support for the age pension. No-one is walking away from the age pension. We have improved it in real terms by 12 per cent since we have been in office compared with a 2.3 per cent reduction when the opposition was previously in government. We have also said that we will maintain it at at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;a commitment which we adhere to and which has not been made by the opposition. That commitment to the age pension is very important for the community to understand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Commencements are starting to. The approvals have been going down for some time and the commencements are starting to. Over the last three years, we have been enjoying the biggest boom in housing in this nation's history. When you are building well ahead of underlying demand year after year, there inevitably comes a time when the excess supply in the market means that the rate of construction is going to start to decline. You cannot go on, in any market, producing way over the basic level of demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what has been supporting the market to this time has been pent-up demand from past years. Essentially, I think the analysts in the industry regard that pent-up demand as now having been well and truly met and that the industry is now coming back more towards the underlying rate of housing demand, which is determined by the rate of growth of family formation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something around 140,000 units a year is about that level of underlying demand. We have still had commencements of about 155,000 over the last 12 months. That means that we are still building above the underlying demand. But, given the forewarning of approvals and finance approvals the honourable member referred to in his question, we can expect that level of commencements to continue to come down, because the fundamental economics of the industry are determining that it will come down.</PARA>

In the recovery from the recession, it was very good that we had the housing industry take off quickly. It was the industry which led us out of the recession back into a substantial growth path.

That is what is happening, nothing more and nothing less. We have forecast in the budget that we expect some further reduction in the industry in the number of units built in 1995-96, but that will be the stabilising of the industry back to levels accommodating the level of demand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lyons very much for his question. All members would be aware that earlier this year the parliament passed what was intended to be model legislation for the development of a common evidence code throughout Australia. At the time of its implementation, it was adopted by the ACT and applied in both Commonwealth proceedings and ACT proceedings. I am very pleased to say that during this month the New South Wales parliament also passed into law mirror legislation. Now we have common rules of evidence which will apply to at least half of the legal proceedings that are initiated throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has played a very substantial role in seeking to obtain agreement towards common approaches in a number of key areas in which the Commonwealth and the states are mutually interested.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an area which not only has an academic interest but also has a very practical interest because of the cost benefits that will accrue if we can obtain a single system of rules which apply across all jurisdictions. Just one example is that at the moment businesses are required to keep very substantial paper records. That is because the older common law systems&mdash;which firstly evolved from an unwritten form and have been codified in different ways in different states for the hearsay rule and the like with respect to admission of documentary evidence&mdash;vary so much. There is quite a lot of complexity particularly for businesses having work across all jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real prospect that with the advances that are made in the Commonwealth model legislation, which provides largely for the electronic storage of documents and the admissibility of evidence of electronic document keeping, millions and millions of dollars could be saved around this country by that one step alone. There are real opportunities in a whole range of areas simply through the efficiencies of the court processes to save clients and lawyers many more millions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the key initiatives behind the Justice Statement that the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and I launched last month.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I urge groups like the Business Council of Australia and other business groups to work with their law societies and with other interested parties and to meet with the state governments that have not yet adopted the scheme to encourage them to do so. I know that Jeff Shaw will be joining me and the Attorney-General in urging all other states to implement mirror legislation in those other jurisdictions at the next meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Perth, which comes up later this month or early next month.

Is it a fact that church and welfare leaders in that state have targeted the flawed state and federal government welfare programs as being the reason why Queensland is the most poverty stricken state in the nation? Did the findings include the claim that too much money was being spent on short-term solutions to poverty rather than targeting those most in need? What action will be taken to rectify this in this election climate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing we need to do is set the record absolutely straight&mdash;if indeed the record needs to be set straight&mdash;to the gentleman concerned in relation to the government's policies in dealing with issues of poverty in this community. The people in Queensland benefit from the same policies as the rest of the country benefits from. What has been made absolutely clear in numerous discussions in this parliament is that this government has put in place a social safety net which has ensured that the poor have been protected and their interests advanced. There is absolutely no question about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last decade when deregulatory policies have opened up our economies for competition right throughout what from time to time has been described as the Anglo-Celtic world, the situation in most countries which we like to compare ourselves with has effectively been that the poor have got poorer as the wealthier have got wealthier. That has not applied here. It has not applied here because that social safety net has been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That social safety net has seen support for the poor in our community in some categories increase by close to 100 per cent in real terms since we have been in office. If you cared to look at any index or social payment from the period when your party was in office and when you were a minister&mdash;you have probably forgotten the time when you were a minister because it was so long ago, although you have trawled around trying to get yourself back into government&mdash;you would see that virtually every one of them has seen a fall. Every one of those indexes has seen real increases since we have been in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the poor and needy in our community have been very well supported. The same applies in Queensland as applies anywhere else in the country. We are left however to conclude what the fate of the poor would be. The opposition certainly owes an explanation to the people in Queensland, since it wants to make this an election issue after putting it in an election context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What policies are you going to pursue? You have said that you will not support the revenue measures in this budget, and you are doing your level best to defeat them, no matter what the implications are. You have said, `We will do it all with savings. We will do it all by ripping away the basis of the social safety net, because there is no other way it can be done.' I suggest that you ring Archbishop Hollingworth and explain to him exactly what it is that you intend to take from the poor and needy in the Queensland community in pursuit of the savings objectives that you have put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted to see that, when the Treasurer was up here answering a question on taxation levels and pointing out that it would take a $44 billion cut for us to produce a taxation level equivalent to Hong Kong's, you were nodding in approval. You must have been thinking, `Absolutely. That is what you ought to be up to.' The figure of $44 billion was pointed out to you as being what could be obtained by cutting away the total of our social security spending.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what you have in mind. So opposition members should not cynically get up here and tell us about the rich and the poor in Queensland. What we have been putting in place for the poor and needy in Queensland&mdash;and everyone else in this country&mdash;is a social safety net which sustains a reasonable life for those people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had over the last week a really quite extraordinary display from the Labor Party on the very important issue of French nuclear testing in the Pacific. It is quite extraordinary because this issue has become a major political issue in Australia. It has become a major political issue in Australia for one reason&mdash;and that is that the people of Australia have one view about French nuclear testing in the Pacific and they expect their government to behave in a strong and defiant way. But the government of Australia has another view, which is that, as far as it is concerned, this is little more than a minor inconvenience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party likes to talk from time to time about the issue of strength, but a real test of strength comes in international relations where 18 million Australians look for true leadership from their government. When the national interest of Australians is threatened or challenged, internationally in particular, the people of Australia expect their government to go out and stand up forcefully for that national interest. The fact is that, when the test has come for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and of course for the discredited Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), the government has failed that test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has said, we have seen an extraordinary display of jellybacked diplomacy. After the French had made their decision, the government announced that it would freeze any future expansion of defence ties with France. What did that mean? That meant the cancellation of a trip by two defence scientists from Australia to Paris to collaborate with French defence scientists. That is all it meant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had one of the more notorious statements from a man who used to be known as Biggles and should again be known as Biggles&mdash;I think we should revive the memory of Biggles&mdash;a man who was prepared to get tough with Tasmania when he was the Attorney-General, a man who sent F111s flying over Tasmania and a man who used the Australian Defence Force to spy on a state of Australia. When it came to French nuclear testing he said, `Oh, well, it could have been worse.' It is an extraordinary display of a man who, after all these years as the foreign minister, regards diplomacy as little more than some kind of 19th century parlour game where people sit around with powdered wigs and artificial beauty spots on their faces. We have Senator Evans with his goggles, his wig, his beauty spot and make-up sitting there playing some sort of parlour game while the rest of Australia is demanding strong action from what has turned out to be a weak, pusillanimous government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of this debate is the extent to which the Labor Party is divided on this issue and the ill feeling there is within the Labor Party over the reaction of Senator Evans and the Prime Minister to French nuclear testing. All I can say is that the whole issue of divisions within the Labor Party is a very serious issue. I noticed the Prime Minister saying yesterday and other people in the Labor Party claiming that, because the coalition moved an amendment to strengthen the Prime Minister's motion moved in the House yesterday, it was somehow undermining Senator Evans's mission to Paris&mdash;that somehow, because the coalition had a difference of view with the government on the strength of the Australian protest, that was undermining Senator Evans's effort. But what was really undermining Senator Evans's effort, other than Senator Evans himself, was the division within the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the French supposed to think when the governing party in Australia is totally divided in its response to French nuclear testing? We had, as I have mentioned already, the Gareth Evans statement that, with eight nuclear devices in Australia's backyard, it could have been worse. But then we had one person who always comes out with the decent truth, the President of the Australian Labor Party, the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), saying that he thought Gareth Evans's remarks were likely to cause concern to Labor Party members. We have, of course, subsequently found that out. The member for Lalor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a lot of concern within Labor Party branches and no doubt when state conferences are held there will be resolutions passed about Senator Evans's remarks.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the President of the Labor Party has taken the view that the government's response is not good enough. This happened last week, but more recently we have seen that the left wing of the Labor Party has come out and simply savaged the government, savaged Senator Evans and savaged the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say more about that in a moment. Suffice it to say that all this squabbling within the Labor Party has been going on while Senator Evans has been entering the gilded halls of Paris to make his fierce, angry representations. I noticed him on the radio this morning in a typical Evans fit of pique. You cannot say anything critical about Senator Evans without him throwing furniture around the room and angrily denouncing people. He was cursing the ABC journalist saying, `Well, what was I supposed to do to the French foreign minister? Poke out his eye? Punch him in the chest&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or, indeed, throw an ashtray at him and send him off as the High Commissioner to Zimbabwe. Remember that story? The reference will be familiar to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, because he knows the full story. The fact is that when it came to the meeting, when it came to the whole issue of Senator Evans's representation, he was, as the Leader of the Opposition has said already, a pussy cat. The French foreign minister no doubt stroked Senator Evans and Senator Evans came purring back to Australia. That has been the style of Senator Evans in dealing with this whole issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has argued for constructive measures for Australia to take which would be proportional to what the French are doing and would represent, I think very directly, the concerns of the Australian people. The constructive measures that we put forward in the amendments moved by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday are actually supported by many people in the Labor Party, as I will soon point out. For example, the coalition said that Australia should join with New Zealand and suspend military cooperation with France except for surveillance, United Nations and humanitarian activities. But today the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), when asked whether the government would do this, started talking about something entirely different, as is so often the case. In other words, the government is not prepared to do this, despite the fact that the left wing of the Labor Party last night, after the TV deadlines had passed, issued a press release saying that that was one of the things the federal government should do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition said that the government should cease refuelling all French non-humanitarian military transit flights. The left wing of the Labor Party, in its statement yesterday, clearly supported that proposition. In other words, a third of the Labor Party supports that proposition. It may be more than a third. I suspect that many people from the Centre Left and the Right support that proposition. The government, though, apparently has rejected that proposition, despite the fact that the overwhelming view of the Australian parliament is that that is the sort of measure that should be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition asked that Australia recall its ambassador for consultations to show the depth of our concern. Most people in this parliament agree with that. The government has decided arrogantly to disregard or ignore the views of the parliament and to ignore, quite clearly, the views of the bulk of the caucus in not proceeding with that measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point here is very simple: the left wing of the Labor Party has for the first time in a very long time shown just a scintilla of courage in standing up to the government. It is the first time in many years, I have to say, that the Left of the Labor Party has turned out to have anything even remotely sensible to say&mdash;I say remotely sensible because when I read the Left's press release I could not help but smile. The second paragraph of the press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Chirac is clearly a captive of the French military-industrial complex . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Those of you who did tertiary education will remember those guys from the Socialist International standing outside union buildings holding up magazines called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Socialist worker</EMPHASIS> which they were trying to sell. They used to be full of expressions like `French military industrial complex'. It is good to see that fringe of the 1960s is still in operation in the Australian Labor Party today. A lot of propositions put forward by the Left, in terms of responding to French nuclear testing, would be unacceptable to the coalition but, having said that, there are some sensible suggestions amongst some rather less than sensible suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deeper point is this: the Labor Party is deeply divided over this issue and that makes the conduct of effective diplomacy almost impossible from Australia's point of view. We have to suffer as a result of this I suppose, but the reality is that if one-third of the parliamentary Liberal Party or the coalition put out a press release basically denouncing the policy of the shadow cabinet it would be a massive story. It would be the lead story on every television bulletin and it would be a front-page splash on every national newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the House will not mind my saying so, and I do not really care whether the press gallery minds my saying so, but I have a suspicion that this press release of the Left is not going to get the same sort of coverage as it would get if a similar act of dissent came from our side of politics. That is an interesting reflection of the double standards that operate in the media in this country. Nevertheless, the government is deeply divided on this issue. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, tragic news. The fact is that the Left is losing the position of the deputy leadership of the Labor Party and it is quite clear the Left knows that it will not get the succession. So the compensation was that the Left was allowed to put out this press release. That is just about the size of it. That is what happened at that meeting&mdash;`Tragic news: we are losing the deputy leadership but at least we can put out a press release flexing our muscles for once, perhaps never to be done again.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting thing I must hasten to add on the issue of divisions in the Labor Party is the way the resignation of the deputy leader of the Labor Party, Brian Howe, was formally made today. What is significant about today? There are a couple of things that you should note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite obvious that a deal has been done to get the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) into that position but, to maximise the opportunity of that deal succeeding, the announcement of the resignation of the deputy leader, Brian Howe, was made while other rivals were inconvenienced. Senator Evans was overseas, making it rather hard for him in the course of today to be doing a lot of ringing round and getting numbers when he is sitting in first class on a Qantas jet flying back to Australia, suffering no doubt from indigestion after his big dinner with the French. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)? It is a convenient day for her to run for the deputy leadership&mdash;the day that the royal commission into her alleged activities gets under way! She is not ringing around today. She is putting out press releases saying hooray, she has got the taxpayers to pay for her legal costs. She has no time whatever to be ringing around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the day has been chosen, and chosen fairly carefully.

That is why I believe we have been so successful in coming up with policies which have met with the approbation of the people whenever we have elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We take advice not just from within the party but from outside it as well. I want to quote some advice which we did take on this very issue. I will not name the author yet because I want to hold off on that. This is the advice we took:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's one of those situations that you've got to keep under review and just as the response today is not necessarily the final response, in some times in these matters what you should do is give an initial response and if that doesn't produce any result, then you might consider a further response and it's never smart in those situations to fire all your shots at once.</PARA>
<PARA>Who said that? That was said by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) at a doorstop interview in Cairns last Wednesday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what you should do is give an initial response and if that doesn't produce any result, then you might consider a further response and it's never smart in those situations to fire all your shots at once.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what the government is doing. We have given an initial response. That initial response was appropriate to the situation. It was a very active response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Australia, as chair of the South Pacific Forum, which organised a delegation to go to Paris. It was Australia, in the person of the Prime Minister, that wrote to and communicated with all the other 14 heads of government of the South Pacific Forum to get their assent to a form of words to be conveyed to the French Prime Minister. It was Australia that put all those arrangements in train. It was Australia, in the person of Gareth Evans, that led that delegation which called on Monsieur de Charatte last evening European time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken an initial position. We have taken a responsible and stern position. I want to recall a motion which was unanimously passed yesterday by this House. It was marred only by the pettifogging and meretricious position of the opposition trying to grandstand on this issue. I remind the House that the motion moved by the Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) condemns the decision of the Government of France to resume testing in the South Pacific;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) calls on the French Government to reverse its decision and not to resume testing;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) shares the resentment of South Pacific countries at nuclear testing in the South Pacific and endorses the statement condemning the decision issued by the South Pacific Forum;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) deplores France's decision to breach its 1992 moratorium which had improved relations between France and countries in the region;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) expresses its outrage that France's decision undermines the outcome of the recent Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Review and Extension Conference, particularly the commitment made at the Conference that, pending entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Band Treaty (CTBT), the nuclear weapon states should exercise utmost restraint;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) notes that Australia will do all in its power and urge all other countries to hold France to President Chirac's statement that France would sign a CTBT without reservation in autumn of 1996; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) calls on France to sign and ratify the protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition and spokesman on the other side said that every point in that had the opposition's assent. It is good to see that it did because those opposite have not always been as consistent and as forthright in opposing nuclear testing in the South Pacific as they were yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years their position has been shifting It has been swaying. It has been uncertain. I think it is because the opposition has a lingering affection for big guns, for big talk and for big and powerful friends. These things sit very uneasily with the kind of stance the Labor Party has&mdash;which has always been to be on the side of those small and almost powerless countries of the South Pacific on whose behalf we spoke then and on whose behalf we speak now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How long ago did the Labor Party begin to speak for those countries? It was the Labor government that took the French to the International Court of Justice in a case which began in 1973 and continued into 1974. As a result of that case&mdash;it was a case in which we brought tremendous pressure to bear on the French&mdash;the French walked away from the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific and entered into a new phase. What was the stance of opposition members at that time? They were out there saying what a wonderful thing this was. In fact, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Billy Snedden, said on 9 May 1973 in this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present circumstances we do not dissent from the Government's action in taking this matter to the International Court of Justice.</PARA>
<PARA>That was said in this House in 1973 by the Leader of the Opposition at the time the Labor Party was taking the French to the International Court of Justice. What a resounding, enthusiastic endorsement of serious and constructive action which the Labor Party then took against the French and which had an immediate and a useful result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government promoted and sponsored the idea of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty. We have consistently urged the French and other nuclear weapon states to sign the relevant protocols of that treaty. It has been a significant item on the agendas of each meeting of the South Pacific Forum ever since and, in particular, at the last South Pacific Forum in Brisbane chaired by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the attitude of the opposition towards the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty? Yesterday there was a howl of outrage and unhappiness from the opposition when its position was stated. But it was the case at the time and it remains so. In 1986 the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Mayo, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why is it necessary to reiterate all these things in the form of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty? The answer is that the raison d'etre of the Treaty&mdash;this needs to be understood&mdash;is to attack the French and the French involvement at Mururoa, and possibly at a later stage in New Caledonia.</PARA>
<PARA>So the rationale of the opposition was to attack the French. What was the attitude of the member for Mayo? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have two objections to the Treaty. One is that it is basically an anti-French treaty and little else . . .  it embarrasses a number of our major allies. Secondly, I think it could be described also as the first stone that has fallen from the edifice which is the Western alliance in our region.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should notice that the emphasis is on `the Western alliance' and not `region'. There was no mention of getting together to support the small countries of the South Pacific; there was just an utter misunderstanding of interests in this part of the world by the opposition. The opposition urges recalling the ambassador from Paris. That is the assumption one has to come to from the statement made by this group within the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what the Leader of the Opposition was saying on the day the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, was speaking in Tokyo. The Leader of the Opposition was doing a pretty good low key impression himself in Cairns. In an interview he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any reasonable diplomatic moves and protests which the federal government wants to take will have our full support.</PARA>
<PARA>He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would that go so far as say withdrawing the ambassador from Paris?</PARA>
<PARA>He answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I think that's a little premature at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA>So the gung-ho-ness of the opposition spokesman is a bit  Johnny-come-lately in the whole thing. We have to ask how unified the opposition is on this issue&mdash;not the Labor Party. The Labor Party&mdash;its platform was recently endorsed in Hobart&mdash;urges all states in the region to ratify the South Pacific nuclear-free zone treaty and all nuclear weapon states to accede to the protocols of that treaty and to support and assist the Pacific island states in opposing nuclear testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the government propose to do about these other measures which are urged on it from various sources? The foreign minister will be back in the country tomorrow. He will be reporting back to the government and to caucus, and we will have a debate about it. The Prime Minister said in the parliament yesterday that when the government has received that report we will be in touch quickly with our forum colleagues to discuss what regional response we can make to France's failure to respond to the indignation felt throughout the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all people, this motion comes from the person who would be foreign minister. His record on matters of foreign policy would make a cat laugh. I will single out two or three things he has claimed to have done in his inept and gaffe-prone style, forged in the deserts of central Australia. He claimed to have strongly raised human rights issues when he met a Vietnamese delegation. It turns out that he did not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Buffoons as we may be, there is one thing that is as certain as day turns to night: on this particular issue there are more fissures in this government than there are in Mururoa Atoll. This government needs to understand three things: firstly, Australian people want less political rhetoric on this issue and more substantive action; secondly, public concern on this issue will last for as long as the half life of radioactive waste, and that is a very long time; and, finally, the motion moved yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on this matter&mdash;I listened to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) wax lyrical about yesterday's motion&mdash;was more notable for what it did not say than for what it did say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I mean by that is that there were too many questions left unanswered. It reflected broad community concerns about the wishy-washy response of this government and the increasingly vocal elements of its own party factional arrangements. But, of course, whilst it was a commendable first step in the need to condemn the French government, without the opposition's robust amendment&mdash;and it was a robust amendment, despite what the minister had to say about it&mdash;it was and remains a phoney smokescreen with a lot of hot air and not much substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand the division within the Labor Party, perhaps I should remind the minister&mdash;since he was so good on the history of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and others&mdash;of what happened in 1985 when we had nuclear ships visit New Zealand, and the MX crisis. At that time we found the Left faction of the Labor Party becoming increasingly vocal about its own government in respect of those issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may not only have been the Left, but the Left was particularly vociferous. I also remind the House of what was said yesterday in response to a question I asked the Prime Minister. I referred the Prime Minister to the announcement last Friday that French ship berthings and aircraft transits through Australia would not be permitted where they were involved in the Pacific nuclear testing program. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the Prime Minister confirm that France has complied with Australian Customs cargo clearance formalities on all past transit flights through Cairns, Darwin or Norfolk Island? If not, as some suggest, why not? What are to be the future clearance arrangements to ensure that the government's decision on Friday is unambiguously effective?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, in his usual fashion, said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government, as I said, will be preparing guidelines which will apply to aspects of defence cooperation. These will be developed to the best of the government's ability so as to require of any French authority undertakings about the nature of the cargoes or the nature of their involvement in transiting Australia. I am not aware of whether any such guidelines existed in the 1980s&mdash;they may well have&mdash;or what the consequences of that application of those guidelines were. But what I am concerned about are the guidelines which apply from here on. The government will be doing as it has said it would do&mdash;preparing guidelines which may apply to any transit flights by the French government.</PARA>
<PARA>What a load of unintelligible Keatingspeak which, wriggle as he might, means absolutely nothing of substance. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch), who is sitting at the table, might react to some of that when he responds as well. As a result, last evening I issued a media release. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does the Government propose to do about two French military CASA 235 aircraft expected to refuel tomorrow (Tuesday) in Darwin and Cairns en route to Noumea.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight, Australians will want to know:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.What is the purpose of the flights?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Does the Australian Government know what is on board? Will it endeavour to find out?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Does it already know about the purpose of these flights? If so, when did it find out?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Does it believe what it has been advised by the French authorities? How can this be independently verified?</PARA>
<PARA>We now have to look at an AAP report of this morning, which states:</PARA>

<PARA>These bans imposed by unions on the refuelling of two French military aircraft which were to transit through Australia is an indication of the discontent in Labor ranks. Although the flights were cancelled, it took the resolve of rank and file unionists, not this government, to send a message to the French government on the issue of nuclear testing in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, I have to say, has remained mute on just how the government plans to enforce its announcement that French aircraft and ships involved in nuclear testing would not be allowed to berth or land in Australia. The Prime Minister should provide some concrete answers to the Australian people on the purposes of French aircraft and ships which use Australian ports, whether the Australian government knows whether they are involved in the nuclear test program, how we know, and whether we can believe what we are told by the French government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat what I said in this place yesterday: France's decision is an abhorrent one. It is a bad one for the people of France and for the world. It is an immoral one so soon after the NPT review and extension conference wherein there was an indefinite extension of that treaty. It is unnecessary and anachronistic in terms of both the raison d'etre for its force de frappe and a post-Cold War situation. It is unduly nationalistic involving a President who wants to pose in terms of his domestic electorate. It has little regard for the international ramifications and the deep sensitivities of other nations, particularly in Australasia and the south-west Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government needs to bite the bullet and provide a response of substance which it has not done to date despite the rhetoric of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, and we will wait to see what he has to say on the issue. Clearly, this is not on the government's agenda at the moment as it melts down in the leadership ranks, and increasingly melts down within its ranks, as a number are deserting a sinking ship. I conclude this debate by suggesting very strongly that this government is very deeply rattled, and it shows. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties have never been supportive of any organisation like the People for Nuclear Disarmament, CND or anything like that; they have denigrated them year after year. Those groups were denigrated for any funding they got. As an example, I will quote what the member for Mayo said in the matter of public importance of 26 November 1986. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party is determined to win their votes back and the way it will do so is simply by buying them. It has used the $3m International Year of Peace program for precisely that purpose. A major beneficiary of peace grants is a group called the People for Nuclear Disarmament, a group which is unashamedly unilateralist, which says it is opposed to the Government's foreign policies, and is certainly strongly opposed to the policies of the Opposition and the mainstream view of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extensive funding was also provided for what is known as the peace bus. That again is a project of the People for Nuclear Disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Friends of the Earth favour the closure of the joint facilities in Australia; they call for a nuclear free Pacific; they want to terminate uranium mining; they want to rip up the ANZUS Treaty&mdash;all things this Government says it does not support, and certainly things the coalition does not support.</PARA>
<PARA>In the past he has had a go at the campaign against nuclear energy. He has said that it is a tax rort. He has also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers would be disgusted to learn that they are, in effect, subsidising the activities of groups which are opposed to the Western alliance and which are trying to halt the development of Australia's uranium resources . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He continually opposes organisations that were set up to achieve exactly what he and his party are trying to espouse now. People could see years ago the problems that could result in the nuclear area. The Johnny-come-latelies across the chamber jump on any bandwagon that they think might win them a few votes. The wording of the motion that we are debating today is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The damage caused to Australia's national interest by deep divisions in the Government over French nuclear testing.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard speeches from those opposite on how the factions are divided. I am surrounded in this chamber by all the factions. I have a member from the Left, a member from the Right, and the Campbell faction surrounding me. I get the views of all the factions so I can assure the House that we are not divided on this issue. We all share one view and that is to make certain that the French learn a lesson and that they know the opinion of Australian people and that that is brought well and truly home to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first time that I can recall that the Liberal and National parties have come on board and supported this issue. Mention was made of the MX crisis in 1985. There was no support for those of us who opposed the testing of this particular weapon. I am certain that if people look back through the records at what the Liberal and National Party members have said over the years, they will find no support for the campaign to stop the expansion of the nuclear industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, I have been campaigning against the expansion of that industry since 1983. In 1986, I spoke on the Chernobyl issue. I do not think the opposition made any reference to that. In 1986, I spoke about the benefits of the South Pacific nuclear-free zone. I know that the member for Mayo is against that. He has said many times that he does not believe that it is worth while and that it would weaken the Western alliance. That fact is in many of his speeches that I have read today. In 1986, I also spoke about uranium mining. On 31 August 1993, I said in relation to uranium mining and the supply of uranium to France:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to look closely at whom we supply our uranium to. I do not like our supplying it to anyone but we do. However, we should make certain that the safeguards that are put in place are strictly adhered to. Who knows what is happening in France? It is threatening to recommence nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll. Who is to say that our uranium is not being used there?</PARA>
<PARA>It was quite a while ago that I raised these concerns. I raised the point that we should outlaw nuclear weapons and that we should take a case to the International Court of Justice. On 10 May 1995&mdash;that is, before this issue came to a head&mdash;when speaking in the debate on the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since this bill was introduced in November 1994 we have had the Oklahoma bombing, the Tokyo gas attack and, in the last few days, there has been a suggestion that France might resume nuclear testing in the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA>Some of the issues that I have raised in this debate I have raised constantly. The federal government has also been raising these issues constantly since it was elected in 1983. Those opposite have jumped on the bandwagon because they think they can see a few votes in it. The people of Australia, and especially those people who have been fighting for this issue over many years, will see through those opposite. You cannot win votes in a couple of weeks by trying to convince people that you have changed your views. You have not changed your views. You will never change your views. Jeff Kennett and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) are the same type of animal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Given recent events and proposed French nuclear tests in the South Pacific, the report which I have just tabled is of timely relevance. At some time scientists will have to undertake a clean-up of Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1953 and 1963 Great Britain conducted several programs of nuclear warhead development trials on the Monte Bello Islands off Western Australia and at Maralinga and Emu in South Australia. Today this would not happen, but at that time it was thought there would be no long-term damage. How wrong this has proven to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maralinga is 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna. Emu is a further 190 kilometres north-east of Maralinga. Detonations of nine nuclear weapons and hundreds of minor trials were carried out which dispersed radioactive materials. Former test sites are contaminated to various levels with plutonium and other artificially produced isotopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1969 Britain undertook a program of clean-up works called Operation Brumby. The 1985 royal commission into British nuclear tests in Australia concluded that the clean-up was inadequate, was based on wrong assumptions and left the area in a more difficult state for any further clean-up. Again, mistakes were made that now have to be rectified. It will be a costly exercise for the Australian taxpayer. The royal commission recommended that action should be taken to reduce radioactive contamination to a level suitable for unrestricted habitation by the traditional Aboriginal owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of rehabilitation options and comparative costs was developed by a technical advisory group. The preferred option&mdash;6(c)&mdash;was used as the basis by the government in negotiations with Great Britain for a substantial contribution to the cost of rehabilitation works. An agreement for an ex gratia payment of #20 million was reached in December 1993. In my personal opinion, that was not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a very important part of its inquiry, the committee inspected the former test sites on the Monte Bello islands off the coast of Western Australia as well as the Maralinga test and trials areas. On our inspections we had experts from Australia and Britain who had been involved in radioactive decontamination worldwide. We also had the benefit of advice from Mr Bruce Church, former assistant manager of environment, safety and health at the Nevada test site and currently the consultant to the US government on radioactive decontamination matters. To the fullest extent possible we were well equipped in our deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that there is a need for remedial action to be undertaken at Maralinga to reduce the radiological hazards at the test sites sufficiently to enable Aboriginal traditional land use and transit of the test site area; to reduce and possibly eliminate the need for control and surveillance of the sites; and to remove potential Commonwealth liabilities arising from site contamination. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $104.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A notable feature of the rehabilitation will involve subjecting the burial pits at Taranaki to in situ vitrification. The contents of the pits will be subjected to enormous quantities of electricity which will literally melt the soil and the contents and fuse them into something resembling glass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want you to be afraid, but for the benefit of honourable members I have a sample of the finished product. This is the first time a sample of in situ vitrification has been exhibited in this building. To ease any fears honourable members might have, I also have a certificate from the Australian Safeguards Office attesting that the sample is non-radioactive. I will not seek the leave of the House to table this sample because I want to keep it. If honourable members wish to examine this sample of in situ vitrification, they can do so in my office&mdash;it is the one that will be glowing. I seek leave to table a copy of the certificate from the Australian Safeguards Office. I do not see anyone from the opposition at the table, but I did check this previously with the member for Mayo (Mr Downer). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. What we are talking about here is new technology, and it is proposed to conduct trials before the final decision to go ahead is made. The committee has therefore recommended that an independent audit of the trials of material containing plutonium should be undertaken by experts not associated with this project. If the results of the review indicate that the in situ vitrification process&mdash;the product of which I have here and which I have previously referred to&mdash;provides encapsulation and mixing of material to prescribed standards, the process can be extended to full-scale treatment of the burial pits at Taranaki. If the results of the in situ vitrification trials are inconclusive or do not provide results to prescribed standards, the further direction of the project should of course then be reviewed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plutonium contaminated soil at Taranaki, Wewak and two other former trial sites will be disposed of in deep trenches adjacent to the contaminated areas. There are numerous other pits which we were assured contain only nominally contaminated debris and soil. These pits will be treated by a variety of methods, ranging from recontouring to total exhumation&mdash;the latter requiring full health physics control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remainder of the pits are to be treated to the extent of tidying up the surface by removal and reburial of exposed debris, or compaction of the debris and restoration of the area. Soil importation will be required at some pits to restore the surface to its natural level. The project is very involved and very expensive. But we cannot walk away; we have to try to restore this land that the British contaminated for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some discussion about the best way of undertaking the remedial work. A number of groups, such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, submitted that it might be more appropriate if all the contaminated soil and other rubbish were stored above ground. The committee concluded however that, based on the evidence, the burial of contaminated soil and other debris appears to be the more appropriate solution compared with above ground storage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project will require a very strict regime of measures designed to protect the workers undertaking the rehabilitation. The report describes in some detail these measures. The committee has concluded that, based on the evidence presented, these measures appear to be adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maralinga is an example to the world that tests carried out for whatever reason have a cost both to health and to finances, and it is the taxpayer who will eventually have to pay. It is indeed a lesson from which others can learn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee members are not experts in this field, but we have thought long about this project. We received advice from experts, both Australian and overseas. We inspected the sites and, on the basis of the evidence, have recommended that the proposed rehabilitation should proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has pointed out, it is rather timely to be launching today this particular report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rehabilitation project, Maralinga, SA</EMPHASIS>, in the wake of discussion about nuclear tests in the Pacific. I think it is also true that the nuclear tests have solicited a great deal of political opportunism in the parliament. I thought it rather interesting that today the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) made reference to the position on nuclear tests which historically has been taken by the Left. Of course, the member for Mayo, through a reference he made in relation to the `rhetoric of the Left', chose to ridicule the Left for linking nuclear tests with, I think, the industrial and political regime in France&mdash;I cannot remember his exact rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point is: it has been the Left historically that has taken the strongest position on nuclear tests. Now we find out&mdash;and it was found out subsequently, even though people knew it at the time&mdash;that the tests at Maralinga, which historically the Left had opposed, were not in Australia's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is with the tests in the Pacific. We know that they will not be in the interests of the people of the Pacific. Yes, we made a point about that today&mdash;and both sides have claimed to be interested in that particular question. However, when the issues were truly raised, when people in the past raised objections to the use of nuclear energy or the holding of nuclear tests, it was not the Right of the parliament which took the strongest opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think it is very appropriate that the member for Throsby should be raising this issue. We should be reflecting truly, unlike the member for Mayo, on the role of the Left in opposing nuclear energy and nuclear tests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rehabilitation project, Maralinga, SA</EMPHASIS>. I believe that it is probably as interesting a referral as we have ever had to the committee. Also, I believe that the inspection and the hearing itself made it quite clear that the committee was dealing with something beyond its own capabilities as far as knowledge was concerned. That is why we relied very</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>heavily on the advice of experts&mdash;and they were very impressive, our own Australian experts and also those coming from both the United Kingdom and America. I believe that they did present the case and that there was no trying to confuse the committee. Their evidence, in which we were given options, was very clearly given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to a situation of trying to deal with a product that has a 24,000-year half life, one wonders in the overall history of mankind whether, with what we are doing today, the trace will be made in future years. But that was one of the assumptions we made&mdash;that it was better to be able to trace the linkage of this for the next 24,000 years than to proceed in the manner in which it has been done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some might have thought this was going to be a typical Brit bash. It was not intended to be. In fact, those who have been to Maralinga would have to give credit to the Brits not only for the layout of the village itself but, more particularly, for the manner in which they used the airport and adjoining roads to collect water for the settlement itself. In this, I believe that there is some residual value in that, once the land goes back to the South Australian government, that area will be used by the area's natives, particularly for its water facilities but more importantly as the surroundings are close to civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations are certainly important. The chairman, the member for Throsby, has already indicated that the recommendations gave us alternatives to consider. One was that the area should be fenced, with storage above ground. It was then thought it would be in terms of 24,000 years before the time came to replace those fences. Another recommendation was to replace the aboveground storage so that perhaps the cost, the inconvenience and probably the urgency into the future would not be there. The committee considered that burial was the best way around the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that we have insisted on an independent audit of the results of the in situ vitrification trials of material containing plutonium. This should be undertaken by committed experts not associated with the project. That gives us some grounds for believing that the whole matter will be taken out of the hands of the contractors and the scientists to make sure that, in its final stage, the project will be safe. If the trial proves inconclusive, we have asked that the direction of the project be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is timely, as other speakers have mentioned, that we should be talking about the clean-up of this waste and whether $100 million will do the job or not. One can only wait and see, because there are certain trials associated with it. But it does give us some cause for reflection, and not only in connection with nuclear waste. The committee is now heavily concerned with contamination and the clean-up of all wastage materials. The experience so far is that the cost of the clean-up is probably greater than the initial value of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the committee was trying to condemn the British for what they did in the past. It is a matter of an evolving process, and the evolution since 1945 has been slow and uncertain. We hope that in 1995 we have the whole thing right. The manner of the storage and the trials will ensure that we know where the contamination is if it has to be looked at in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to the scientists who came before us as witnesses. As I said, they were not trying to gild any lily. They gave it as they saw it and thought it at the time. I believe that their evidence was convincing to the extent that the recommendations have been made. I say also to the people at the Maralinga site&mdash;and a few remain in the security forces&mdash;that they are doing a great job of securing the area. Until you get there, you do not realise how beautiful that area is. One would hope that in the future the areas will rehabilitate and be a great natural part of Australia. I again thank the chairman, the member for Throsby, who seems to rise to the occasion every time, in spite of the difficulties he had in getting to the site and guiding his group. He did a great job, as did all of those associated with the secretariat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The interest in the proposed clean-up of Maralinga is shown by the number of members from the Public Works Committee participating in the debate, and it illustrates how significant this project is. I rise to speak as the only South Australian on the committee&mdash;and therefore as a South Australian directly interested in this project&mdash;and to acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the members for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), Throsby (Mr Hollis) and Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), all of whom are members of the committee and who similarly found this a fascinating project. I must also acknowledge the presence of the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), in whose electorate Maralinga is located. He was present for both the inspections and the committee hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman said, Maralinga is situated 270 kilometres north-west of Ceduna. One of the test sites, Emu, is a further 190 kilometres from Maralinga. After travelling to these places, you begin to get an impression of the vast distances that characterise that part of Australia and, it is fair to say, the electorate of Grey. The committee, under the chairmanship of the member for Throsby, visited both the Monte Bello Islands and Maralinga in order to become more acquainted with what atomic testing does and what cleaning up an atomic test site is all about. We were accompanied by a number of experts, including people from the Australian Radiation Laboratory, and I found their input to be invaluable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian, I was fascinated by the Maralinga project. I had heard about it&mdash;as every Australian surely must have&mdash;but I had never been there before. I found myself in an isolated area and, as the member for Dawson said, a geographically very attractive area. It is an area that is now regularly patrolled by the Commonwealth in order to ensure that people do not unwittingly move into areas that they should be kept out of. While the old Maralinga village is largely dismantled, the old hospital is still there as an administrative and accommodation centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pick up some of the comments made by the member for Dawson. I came away from the hearing less critical of the British than when the hearing started. It is quite true, as the member for Throsby said, that the #20 million offered is insufficient and that more ought probably have been negotiated. It is also true to say that the British did not do enough to clean up the site. But I cannot be as critical of the British as I originally was after witnessing the amount of clean-up that had occurred and recalling that much of these tests had occurred between 1953 and 1963 when we did not appreciate the hazard that currently exists and when this particular part of Australia was seen as an area that had not been and would not again be inhabited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The country we were looking at is the country inherited by the Maralinga Tjarutja people. When the British first proposed that it ought be used as a nuclear test site, there was no-one there. It was not a case, as is popularly mentioned, of the Tjarutja people being taken off the site. In fact the people, not surprisingly, had moved south to a mission that was being maintained by Daisy Bates. When the late Len Beadell came over the hill and surveyed this particular stretch of Australia, he thought he had located an area that was unoccupied by human beings. Not surprisingly, when the Brits moved in, they moved in presuming it would never be occupied again and would always be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was astonished by the infrastructure that had been brought in and maintained by the British. The most remarkable part of that infrastructure is the airport facility. It is the second largest sealed runway in South Australia. I am told that it was designed entirely by the British, not only for heavy transport aircraft but so that, in that area of South Australia where rainfall is such a rare commodity, all of the rainfall that was possible would be collected off the tarmac to run into a remarkable series of channels into a reservoir to be pumped into galvanised iron and concrete tanks in order to provide a rain water storage. It is of itself quite a remarkable facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I left there more reserved in my criticism, having recognised what had been done by the British in an effort to clean up the facility that they recognised they had polluted. While the clean-up was inadequate and the subsequent clean-up that occurred under Operation Brumby in July 1967 was still inadequate&mdash;leaving the taxpayers of Australia with a clean-up bill of more than $100 million&mdash;it is a little unfair to simply paint the British as having walked away from a difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one or two more comments, and I appreciate that I am speaking by leave through the government's generosity. I had not realised until I arrived at Maralinga how careful the British had been to ensure that vehicles that were used in the nuclear test area never travelled into a non-contaminated area. They had a whole fleet of vehicles that were kept simply for maintaining the test area. We were told that 22 land rovers, a road grader and a bulldozer were maintained in the test area. It was recognised that they may have been contaminated and, because of that, they were never allowed to leave the test area and travel to Maralinga village. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the test, a huge trench was dug, and these vehicles were placed in the trench and the trench was filled. To this day, they remain there. Part of the intention of the in situ vitrification referred to by the chairman is to ensure that those vehicles can never be unearthed because they will become part of the molten mass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman has indicated, the intention is to take any one of the test sites that is still contaminated by plutonium and dig a huge trench in which to bury the topsoil that is contaminated. Where the contamination is deemed to be of a level that poses a real hazard to human health, the aim is to use in situ vitrification to ensure not that it ceases to be radioactive&mdash;because the radioactivity will continue even after this glassification has occurred&mdash;but that the radioactivity is locked in a molten block, such as the block displayed by the member for Throsby. As such, it will still be radioactive, but it will be inaccessible. Obviously, we hope that this relatively new technique, which has been proven in the United States, works successfully on the Maralinga site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by pointing out that the plutonium of course remains there&mdash;it remains a hazard&mdash;but it will no longer be accessible. The problem that exists right now with handing this site back to the original owners is the characteristic Aboriginal lifestyle which would have children playing in the dust and likely to inhale small particles of plutonium that currently exist in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple reality is that, if one were merely to ingest that plutonium, one would probably not face a real hazard because, like the uncomfortable experience of chemotherapy, the body would react and the plutonium would be expelled from the body. The stomach would say, `No, thank you very much.' But if one were to inhale the plutonium then it would lodge in the lungs. Anyone suffering that sort of fate would suffer very nasty consequences indeed and very likely would face the reality of dying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman of the committee has said, there are a number of areas where the British have buried debris&mdash;material such as instrumentation and extensive cords and wires. In instances where these areas seemed to be untidy, we were told that they had simply been exhumed by the Radiation Laboratory in order to assess what was in the pits. Clearly, in the past they had not been exhumed. As the report indicates, they will be buried once again and are deemed to be safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed with the efforts that were being made by the Australian Radiation Laboratory to ensure that all people engaging in this clean-up will be working in conditions that make worker safety a first priority. It is obvious that, by airconditioning the cabins and by using radiation level monitors in the cabins, the work force will be exposed to very little hazard. Those are conditions that the rest of us would endorse. It is on the understanding that every possible occupational health and safety instrument will be used that the committee has endorsed this particular clean-up proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have little else to add except that, while I thought the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) can rightly claim to have had a somewhat purer track record on the whole question of disposal of radioactive waste than the rest of us, it is much easier with hindsight to get 20/20 vision. It is fair to say that, when these experiments occurred, what was deemed to be a reasonable clean-up was undertaken. Clearly, in 1995 that is not reasonable. I hope future generations will deem that what the Public Works Committee has decided to allow to proceed will have been a wise decision and will ensure that no further hazard exists for those who will then occupy the land. </PARA>

<PARA>The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill contains a range of major and important reforms to bankruptcy law. It constitutes the second part of the government's program of wholesale reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the first part of which was contained in the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 which came into operation on 1 July 1992. The major reforms contained in that act have been very successful in ensuring that returns to creditors are increased, that appropriate weapons are available to bankruptcy trustees to deal with those who seek to avoid their obligations to disclose assets and contribute from their income and that small consumer debtors are able to get early discharges from their bankruptcy where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill further advances the government's aim of modernising this area of the law and ensuring that an appropriate balance is achieved between the aims of financially rehabilitating debtors and providing proper returns to creditors. The reforms contained in this bill represent the culmination of more than 18 months of careful development and community consultations. The reforms will:</PARA>
<PARA>.provide a `one-stop service' to the public in bankruptcy matters, which will substantially improve the availability and accessibility of information and services about bankruptcy;</PARA>
<PARA>.modernise and make more workable the act's provisions relating to transfers of property prior to bankruptcy;</PARA>
<PARA>.improve the operation of the income contribution scheme, introduced in 1992;</PARA>
<PARA>.streamline, and thus render more economical and workable, part X of the act, which provides for alternatives to bankruptcy;</PARA>
<PARA>.provide a new form of simple, no cost alternative to bankruptcy for low income debtors with few assets and small debts;</PARA>
<PARA>.improve the registration arrangements, duties and powers of trustees; and</PARA>
<PARA>.create an improved national personal insolvency index on a proper statutory basis, subject to scrutiny by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this important bill it is opportune to address briefly some of the recent ill-informed criticism of the effectiveness of bankruptcy law. This has included calls for introducing harsh provisions to strip away the wealth of the families of bankrupts, regardless of where and how it was acquired, and to nullify transfers of property made long before bankruptcy, regardless of the circumstances. These calls, if heeded, would result in substantial injustice in a large number of cases. It must be remembered that most bankrupts are ordinary people, small business people or wage and salary earners who have got themselves into financial difficulty for a wide variety of reasons, some of which are beyond their control. For example, some farmers and small business people in rural areas have gone bankrupt because of the drought. Draconian provisions of the kind some are calling for would have an extremely harsh and unjust effect on these people and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our system, the law enables people to set up artificial entities to carry on business, restricts exposure to unlimited liability, and the commercial community relies on the various legal protections conferred on such entities in making investment decisions, carrying out entrepreneurial activities and contributing to economic growth. Risk taking and speculation are fundamental features of economic activity in our system and, while non-repayment of debts or repayments which are trifling in comparison to the level of indebtedness may be highly undesirable, they are an inevitable incident of ordinary economic activity. The law also enables people to transfer assets and property freely when an individual has no creditors, although subsequent insolvency may result in such transfers of assets or property being set aside, in certain carefully defined circumstances. A rational and orderly insolvency system must concentrate its attention, as this bill does, on defining these circumstances so as to do justice to all, not on arbitrary confiscation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is why the government is committed to sensible, rational and balanced law reform which promotes the best interest of all Australians and improves their access to the justice system, and the measures in the bill will further those objectives. The policy objectives underlying the many initiatives contained in the bill are dealt with in some detail in section 2 of the explanatory memorandum presented when the bill was given a first reading on 8 March 1995, and I commend that to honourable members. I will confine my remarks to the principal features of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">One-stop service</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes the abolition of the offices of Registrar and Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy, and the distribution of the functions performed by them among the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, the official receivers, trustees and the Federal Court. This will ensure that the public is provided with a much better service, having to deal with one administrative agency in relation to bankruptcy and personal insolvency matters&mdash;that is, the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, in the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;rather than two agencies, ITSA and the Federal Court, by virtue of the fact that the court's registry staff are the bankruptcy registrars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the functions presently performed by the registrar will, after the commencement of the bill, be carried out by official receivers. These functions include:</PARA>
<PARA>.issuing bankruptcy notices;</PARA>
<PARA>.accepting debtor's petitions;</PARA>
<PARA>.maintaining bankruptcy records, within the framework of the proposed new national personal insolvency index, NPII;</PARA>
<PARA>.administering the prebankruptcy moratorium provisions, under which a debtor who proposes to present a debtor's petition against himself or herself can invoke a seven-day stay period to enable him or her to give consideration to whether he or she should enter an insolvency administration outside bankruptcy;</PARA>
<PARA>.accepting authorities signed by debtors under section 188 to enable the debtor to propose to creditors an administration under part X of the act, namely a deed of assignment, a deed of arrangement or a composition;</PARA>
<PARA>.being the repository for documents required to be filed by registered trustees, such as accounts relating to the administration of estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability of official receivers to accept section 188 authorities will provide a minor but important adjunct to the one-stop service; namely, administering part X arrangements for those for whom they are appropriate but who could not otherwise afford the cost. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Revision of antecedent transaction avoidance provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental feature of the law of bankruptcy is that, in certain circumstances, it operates to enable property and money given or transferred by a person who subsequently becomes a bankrupt to be recovered by the bankruptcy trustee, to enable its sale and the distribution of the proceeds of the sale to the bankrupt's creditors. The current law provides for a period of `relation back' and makes specific provision in relation to `settlements' of property, in section 120, fraudulent transactions, in section 121, and preferential payments or transfers to creditors, in section 122. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals in the bill to revise the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions and the income contribution scheme, to which I shall refer later, are in the government's firm view sensible, rational, balanced and will well serve the interests of the Australian community. The terms used in the current antecedent transaction avoidance provisions are somewhat esoteric and full of tautologies. The provisions focus largely on the nature of the transaction being impugned and the intention of the parties to the transaction. The changes proposed to this area of the law will simplify it by changing its focus to the nature of the transactions and the likely effect on the creditors. For example, the bill proposes the replacement of section 120 with a much simplified provision, under which a transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt is void against the trustee if it took place not earlier than five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and the transferee gave no consideration, or consideration less than the market value of the property concerned, as at the time of the transfer. If the transfer took place more than two years but not more than five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy, the transfer will be valid against the trustee if the recipient of the property proves that the transferor was not technically insolvent at the time. The term `technically insolvent' refers to a situation where a person's property and income are insufficient to meet the person's liabilities, including any secured liabilities and potential liabilities under a guarantee for another person. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Improving the income contribution scheme</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 made a number of important reforms including, among other things, the introduction of a regime of compulsory contributions from income by bankrupts whose incomes exceed a specified threshold. This regime has been extremely effective in ensuring that those who can afford to do so make some contribution to paying their debts and increasing returns to creditors, but experience has necessitated some improvements to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendment proposed to the act by the bill in relation to the income contribution scheme established under division 4B of part VI of the act is the revision of the definition of `income', in particular to overcome the restrictive interpretation placed on it by the Federal Court in the case of Bond v Ramsay 1994, 125 ALR 399. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the income contribution scheme was devised, it was intended to catch the value of gifts, payments of expenses and similar benefits provided to, or on account of, a bankrupt by benefactors, whether or not the bankrupt was employed by, or worked or provided services for, or on behalf of, the benefactor. However, the Federal Court in Bond v Ramsay considered the definition of `income' was inadequate to enable the value of benefits provided to a bankrupt in other than an employment context to be included. The bill includes amendments to restore the position to what it was believed and intended by the parliament to be prior to the Federal Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the definition of `income' is to be further expanded so that it will encompass the value of loans given to the bankrupt, whether or not the loans are strictly loans in a legal sense or whether they are advances pursuant to some arrangement or understanding whether or not enforceable at law or in equity. Some bankrupts are given the benefit of so-called loan accounts by family or related companies, in the same manner as they may receive non-cash benefits. Again, it is considered reasonable that, where the bankrupt gets a benefit of this kind, it should not be to the exclusion of his or her creditors, as such loan facilities are in many cases made available by persons or other entities who have been the recipient of largesse by the bankrupt in earlier times. Entitlement to moneys accumulated in loan accounts can sometimes be regarded as assets, which vest in the trustee. These amendments are designed to ensure that benefits obtained by bankrupts from loan accounts that cannot be characterised as assets forming part of the divisible property of the estate are taken to form part of the bankrupt's income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Income contributions are assessed in relation to contribution assessment periods, CAPs. The first contribution assessment period begins at the commencement of bankruptcy and ends on the anniversary of that date. Subsequent periods last for one year and the final period ends when the bankrupt is discharged or the bankruptcy is annulled. The bill proposes an amendment so that the first CAP in a bankruptcy will begin at the date of the bankruptcy, rather than at its commencement. The commencement of a bankruptcy could be many months before the actual date of bankruptcy, and it has proved difficult in practice to make assessments of income in relation to periods before the bankruptcy begins. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Revision of part X of the act by streamlining establishment processes and making meeting procedures align with those in bankruptcy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part X of the act provides for debtors to enter into insolvency administrations outside bankruptcy. In particular, a debtor can enter into a deed of assignment, a deed of arrangement or a composition. The manner in which a part X administration is initiated is provided by a debtor signing an authority under section 188 of the act in favour of a registered trustee or a solicitor. Within 10 days before giving the authority, the debtor must complete a statement of his or her affairs, which is given to the registered trustee or the solicitor. A solicitor's obligation is to call a meeting of the creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of a registered trustee, the trustee, as well as having to call a meeting of the debtor's creditors, must take control of the debtor's property. The debtor is not able to deal with the property without the express authority of the trustee. The control period continues until the creditors resolve to release the debtor's property from control, a deed of assignment or deed of arrangement is executed by the debtor, a composition is accepted by the creditors, the court releases the debtor's property from control, the debtor becomes a bankrupt or the debtor dies, whichever happens first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a number of changes to division 2 of part X. First, the functions of a solicitor and those of a registered trustee will be made the same, that is, both will assume control of the property of the debtor after consenting to exercise the powers conferred by an authority under section 188.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes provision for the control period to come to an end by operation of law. At present, the control period can continue indefinitely, if creditors do not agree on any part X proposal or release the debtor's property from control, the debtor does not become bankrupt or die, and no person applies to the court for an order releasing the debtor's property from control. In these circumstances, the debtor and the controlling trustee may be exposed to liabilities for offences or costs, and it is appropriate that the period should come to an end without the need for applications to the court or the convening of a meeting of creditors for these purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When an authority under section 188 in favour of a registered trustee comes into effect, the trustee is able to deal with the debtor's property as if he or she were the attorney of the debtor, and the debtor is not able to deal with his or her property, except to the extent the trustee authorises. The bill will modify this position so that the coming into effect of an authority will give rise to a statutory charge over the debtor's property, so that the trustee's control over the property is enhanced, and property potentially available to creditors under a possible future part X administration is not dissipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions dealing with the calling of meetings and procedure at meetings are proposed to be repealed, and the comprehensive provisions of division 5 of part IV of the act, laying down a code of meeting procedure in relation to bankruptcy, is to be made applicable to meetings under part X so that the same set of basic rules about meetings will be applicable in all the forms of administration available under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important change is that proposed to section 204 of the act. One of the special resolutions that a meeting of creditors called pursuant to section 188 authority can pass is that the debtor present a debtor's petition for bankruptcy within seven days of the passing of the resolution. There are instances where the debtor does not do this, and creditors are then put to the inconvenience and expense of having to bring proceedings against the debtor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the bill proposes that meetings of creditors be able to pass a special resolution that the debtor become bankrupt, and the debtor will become bankrupt by operation of law on the 15th day after the passing of the special resolution, unless the debtor applies to the court for and order setting aside the resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the debtor does apply to the court for an order, the control period will continue until the application is disposed of by the court. If the court dismisses a debtor's application, or the debtor's application lapses or is withdrawn, the debtor will become a bankrupt at the time of the dismissal, withdrawal or lapsing of the application.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a number of years, there have been calls for a formal insolvency administration outside bankruptcy and part X that can be availed of by people with low levels of debt, few assets and low incomes who are not able to afford or enter part Xs and in respect of whom the comparative formalities of part X and the full rigours of bankruptcy are not necessary or desirable. The bill proposes the insertion of a new part IX into the act which sets up a simple form of insolvency administration to be known as debt agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debtors with levels of liability not exceeding $20,000 will be able to put forward a proposal to creditors for dealing with debts. Proposals might relate to matters such as the payment of less than the full amount of all or any of the debtor's debts, a moratorium on payment, periodic payments out of income or an undertaking to seek financial advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debtor would put the proposal to the official trustee, that is, ITSA, which would be responsible for ascertaining whether the proposal was acceptable to the debtor's creditors. This could be done in two ways: either by calling a meeting of the creditors or by sending notice of the proposal to the creditors, and requesting them to indicate by voting letter whether they accept the proposal. Before a proposal can become a debt agreement, it must get the approval of 75 per cent in value and a majority in number of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same mechanisms will be able to be used to vary and terminate debt agreements. In addition, the bill provides for the termination of a debt agreement by the court, and will empower the court to declare a debt agreement to be void. A debt agreement will otherwise come to an end when the debtor has fulfilled all of his or her obligations under it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A debt agreement could provide for the debtor to make payments to creditors directly, or for this to be done by some other third party, or perhaps one of the creditors on behalf of the others. A debt agreement will release the debtor from debts which would be provable in bankruptcy as if the debtor had become a bankrupt when the particulars of the agreement are recorded on the national personal insolvency index. The making of a debt agreement will operate to stay legal proceedings for enforcement of debts, other than debts or liabilities arising under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Used in conjunction with the existing pre-bankruptcy moratorium provisions, the government is confident that small debtors will be able to avail themselves of this new, simple and economical form of administration, thus avoiding bankruptcy, its disabilities and stigmas, while at the same time arriving at arrangements with creditors likely to result in a better return for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these measures, the bill proposes a new system for registration of trustees, a more contemporary statement of the duties of trustees, enhancement of investigative powers of trustees, the creation of a new statutory register of bankruptcy information to be styled on the national personal insolvency index, and related reform measures which will greatly improve the operation of the bankruptcy system to the advantage of those in the Australian community who come into contact with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to assist in modernising the law on personal insolvency. The key provisions in the bill include a simplified process for low income, minor bankruptcies, the creation of a one-stop bankruptcy shop and the tightening of provisions dealing with those who divest themselves of property to third parties when facing bankruptcy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of 1993 the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) released three discussion papers on the reform of this act. The papers dealt with administration, property available for the payment of debts, administration of estates and reform of part X of the act. They arose largely out of the Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry. The government did not adopt that report in its entirety. These discussion papers developed the work that had been done by the Law Reform Commission. Some of these amendments are a result of the papers in order to improve drafting of the act itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should foreshadow to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) that the opposition will be seeking, because of concerns it has about a number of specific provisions which I will identify during my speech, at a later point in time when the matter is considered at the end of the second reading stage to have the matter referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report. It is a very important proposal and one I would ask the parliamentary secretary and the government to consider. I hope there has been a element of forewarning in relation to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view is that the matters need to be examined in a more open forum. But, as these matters are invariably dealt with in the Senate, and its workload is such that matters of this sort requiring a great deal of consideration can well be delayed, it is our considered view that the government would be better served if it utilised the services of a committee of this House to undertake that review. I would hope that when this amendment is proposed the government will see fit to adopt it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the act itself, firstly in relation to the administration of bankruptcy matters, the proposed changes will provide that the Federal Court in the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act will have exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy apart from the residual jurisdiction of the High Court. The administration, day-to-day record keeping and documentation procedures will be handled by one agency. The bill proposes the concept of a one-stop shop with the transfer of certain administrative functions from the Federal Court to the organisation that administers these matters, ITSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office of registrar and deputy registrar in bankruptcy will be abolished and their duties transferred to the official receiver. This would allow the ordinary debtor who files for bankruptcy to deal with ITSA alone and to obtain service by the one Commonwealth agency. It would also avoid the present exchange of documentation between the Federal Court and ITSA and it would reduce the cost involved in duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While to have one agency handle bankruptcy matters will be less costly than the current court process, the recent High Court decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission does raise some concerns. While the High Court indicated that it is often difficult to separate judicial and administrative functions apart from the issue of enforceability which is clearly an exercise in judicial power, it is worth commenting that this is a matter which may only be resolved by litigation. I know that the Commonwealth advisers are hesitant to accept that point, but I have seen a great deal of the court's involvement in matters of this sort when people find it necessary to approach it and these arguments are ones in which the court is obviously taking some interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia is concerned at the consolidation of power into the hands of ITSA, as the amendments will further concentrate its power. Serious concerns have been raised about ITSA by practitioners who have indicated that in their view it is underperforming. ITSA is also in direct competition with private trustees and can have a conflict of interest between the administration of estates and supervision of the conduct of private trustees&mdash;a concern which has been noted by the Law Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on to the property and other transactions prior to the bankruptcy amendments to section 120, 121 and 122, the date of bankruptcy is said to commence on the occasion of the first act of bankruptcy within six months before the actual date of presentation of the petition. This means that certain transactions are rendered void against a claim by the trustee. In certain circumstances, some property settlements dating back as far as five years can be challenged by the trustee. The law currently looks to the intention of the parties and the nature of the settlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will make substantial changes to the antecedent transaction provisions by substituting two of the sections and substantially modifying the other. These provisions are the cornerstone sections which make certain dispositions of property made by the bankrupt before his or her bankruptcy void against the trustee. The bill will change the test for determining whether these prior settlements are immune from claims. The simpler test under the bill will mean that if the bankrupt transferred property to another person for no consideration or for less than the market value those transactions may be subject to a claim by the trustee. The test will be one of whether at the time of the transfer of the property the now bankrupt was `technically insolvent'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will place the emphasis on the likely effect on creditors of that earlier transaction. This will attempt to overcome a rort, if it is alleged, which will enable the debtor to transfer property to escape a personal guarantee and to then declare bankruptcy. There are some very notable persons who have been made bankrupt as a result of personal guarantee provisions. This has highlighted greater attention on these matters because of the public notoriety of some of these cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `technically insolvent' raises a number of concerns as it catches potential liabilities. This definition could technically catch individuals who, under the principle of joint and several liability, are called upon to provide for the entire sum of a guarantee. While guarantors may have the funds to provide for their expected part of the amount, they may be unable to provide for the entire guarantee and may therefore come under the definition of technically insolvent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Registered trustees, the Law Council and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia are concerned about the wording of these provisions. They have indicated that while they agree with the modernising and strengthening of the antecedent transaction issues involved in this legislation this definition is very wide ranging. It could lead to endless debate. I am going to give you some of the examples that were submitted to us that highlight the difficulty due to the drafting of the term `technically insolvent'. The first example states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where a person has a housing loan but there is no default under it, and there is no realistic prospect of default, is the principal sum owed under the housing loan&mdash;which may have a term of many years&mdash;to be taken into account in assessing solvency? If so, how is the calculation to be made?</PARA>
<PARA>Another example provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there are joint and several guarantors, it would be impossible to accurately assess the financial position of any one of them without investigating the financial position of the others. For example, if there are 10 guarantors who jointly and severally guarantee a debt of $100,000, and the subject guarantor has assets of, say $30,000, that person might think he or she is technically solvent. If that person were called on to pay the full amount guaranteed he or she would ordinarily have a right of indemnity against the co-guarantors. If those co-guarantors have assets, then the right of indemnity has value. However, if the co-guarantors do not have assets, then even though the subject guarantor has sufficient assets to cover his or her own share of the liability under the guarantee, that person will (apparently) be technically insolvent within the meaning of the definition.</PARA>
<PARA>Of further concern is the provision which stipulates that, if less than market value is provided for the transfer, then the transfer will be void against the trustee. This provision may very well affect innocent transferees. A transferee who, due to normal circumstances, is able to acquire an asset at a price less than market value, and given real consideration for the asset, will be caught by the provisions. In some cases, it will not be known by a transferee for a period of up to five years whether or not the transfer is safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council has indicated that there is a serious potential for unjust outcomes in relation to innocent purchasers whose only crime is the acquisition of property at less than the objectively ascertained market value of the property. It is further commented that there should be some attempt to achieve consistency with the Corporations Law. The Corporations Law provides that if there is no market value then the best price reasonably obtainable in the circumstances should be realised. Therefore, this issue must be examined, in our view, by a committee of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That these provisions will apply to all bankruptcies that are current when provisions are finally enacted amounts to retrospective legislation, which is of great concern to the coalition. While there is support for provisions which strengthen the ability of the trustee to avoid antecedent transactions, these new provisions would apply only to transactions which take place after the new sections commence operation. For the above reasons, in our view, a committee of this parliament must closely examine these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to insolvency administrations outside an actual bankruptcy, the Bankruptcy Act provides, in part X, for arrangements which are a step short of bankruptcy, such as an agreement for a schedule of payment by instalments. The bill amends these procedures to make the procedure the same for both solicitors and trustees who act for debtors who enter into assignments, arrangements or compositions under part X. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also introduce a new form of debt administration, which will be known as a part IX debt agreement, which will apply to debtors whose level of liability does not exceed $20,000. This will provide for the circulation of a debtor's proposal for payment of less than the full amount or for periodic payments. This new part is an attempt to simplify the proceedings for a debtor where the debtor owes a smaller amount, as can be done with the additional requirements for a part X arrangement and is done through the official trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concerns are that the legislation will consolidate the power of ITSA by casting it in the role as regulator and adviser. Therefore, debtors may not get the most objective, best advice and may not seek their own independent advice from a third party but accept the advice of ITSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of practitioners have mentioned a lack of a level playing field between the official trustee and registered trustees. The Insolvency Practitioners Association believes that there needs to be a level playing field between the two. While the official trustee is subsidised, private trustees are not. The bill will allow official trustees to accept appointment under part X of the act, but private trustees will not be allowed to accept appointments in relation to the new debt agreements under the new part IX to be inserted by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the threshold amount of $20,000 may be too low. It may be more appropriate to have a higher amount, such as $50,000. While this is an experimental section it should be fully examined, in our view, by an independent committee of this parliament in order to secure the best possible advice and result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further issue is the income contribution from bankrupts. Probably these are the most contentious provisions in the bill. By way of background, the amendments are in response to the Federal Court decision in Bond v. Ramsay of 1994. In this case the trustee classified the provision of over $700,000 in housing, office expense, travel and telephone and legal expenses by Mr Bond's family and associates as fringe benefits and, therefore, income related, attracting the income contribution provisions of the act. Mr Bond was therefore required to make a substantial income contribution to reduce his debts. He challenged this assessment and was successful on appeal to the Federal Court, and the $700,000 was considered to be gifts and not income. In this case the trustee is appealing this decision to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill attempts to restore what was intended in the original amendments in 1992 dealing with income contributions from bankrupts and will now cover loans and other benefits to bankrupts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the concerns that have been raised with us include the key provision to amend the definition of income in section 139L, which will include the value of a benefit that is provided in any circumstances and the value of a loan made to a bankrupt. This means that a bankrupt who receives a payment of legal fees to challenge a decision of the trustee may be required to make an income contribution on the basis that the payment of legal fees, perhaps in the form of legal aid, would fall within the definition of income. The trustee, while having a discretion to exclude certain payments from the income contribution provisions, in reality may rarely exercise this discretion. In some areas of government people are given discretions which they decline to exercise. Sometimes it depends on whether or not they are compellable. I am not sure of the nature of this discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council has raised a contrasting concern indicating that the proposed amendment may not work as, although it attempts to remove the requirement for a benefit to be provided in respect of employment, it may still require an employment nexus, relying as it does on the definition of benefit in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern that the way in which the income provision has been drafted&mdash;that any provision under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act can be amended by regulation for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act&mdash;is an inappropriate delegation of legislative power and may be open to constitutional challenge. The Law Council is concerned that these new sections should not apply to transactions which took place before the commencement of the new provisions, as such retrospective operation would be quite unfair. The coalition shares those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the initial income contribution provisions have been held to have a result not intended by the government, it is vital that this matter be fully examined in order that these sections be drafted appropriately and be workable. They must strike a sensible balance. While these amendments may make it harder for high-flying bankrupts to take advantage of the legislation, they may make it impossible for ordinary small business bankrupts to receive assistance such as the provision of legal aid to challenge a decision of trustees during bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New duties of trustees will be introduced which will require a more commercial orientation of trustees. The trustee will be required to report to creditors within three months on the specific issue of whether creditors can be entitled to expect a dividend and also to administer estates with a view to avoiding unnecessary expense. The official trustee will not become the role registering authority for trustees. In our view, these amendments are not controversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concerns have been expressed by the Law Council and the Insolvency Practitioners Association that no attempt has been made in the bill to achieve consistency with the relevant provisions of the Corporations Law. If the government is serious about simplification, this issue must be examined closely. There will be significant power within the proposed regulation making power. The Insolvency Practitioners Association is concerned about this; for example, the power to set remuneration for registered trustees. It recommends a working party approach with the Insolvency Practitioners Association to any proposed regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not produced the bill in the form of an exposure draft, as was done in the case of proposals to simplify the Corporations Law. I understand from my discussion with officers that the view is that exposure drafts are a more appropriate form of procedure to follow when state governments and other legislative bodies are involved. In our view, the exposure draft system is one that ought to be used more widely, particularly when there are special interests and groups with a capacity to offer views on provisions that can be quite complex and quite difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that this legislation emanated from a general inquiry into insolvency by the Law Reform Commission. Its report included a draft bill. It is not the Law Reform Commission's work, which was the subject of a great deal of public inquiry and submission, that we are now implementing; it is the document that has been the subject of further consideration and further papers produced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, many of the matters of concern that I have raised in this debate that have been put to us by insolvency practitioners, the Law Council and its committees may well have been resolved if the bill had been produced earlier in exposure form and the views of these bodies taken into account. I think one of the commentaries I have used in the preparation of these comments was made available to the government's advisers only yesterday. It seems to me that, when we are working in this sort of time frame, these important matters that ought to be the subject of consideration cannot be taken into account while we deal with legislation of this sort in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporate law simplification program has produced proposals for simplification. We might have been able to achieve more in that way in this legislation if it had been produced as an exposure draft. The corporate law simplification program has been greeted very favourably by the professions. That this process was not undertaken here is regrettable in our view, given the size of the bill and the many critical comments that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons&mdash;I have outlined in detail a number of them&mdash;that we believe this bill should be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for report, in particular on the issues of retrospectivity, the definition of what it is to be technically insolvent and the appropriateness of the income contribution provisions. At an appropriate time I will seek leave of the House to suspend standing orders to ensure that I am entitled to move a motion to refer this bill to the committee. I understand the appropriate time to do that is shortly after motion for the second reading has been put, so I will wait until that time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian bankruptcy law applies to an individual who is unable to pay his or her own debts. The Commonwealth Bankruptcy Act is a law made pursuant to section 51(xvii) of the constitution. Many people get confused with individual and corporate insolvency. Corporate insolvency is dealt with under the Commonwealth's Corporations Law. In our view, one of the aims should be that the laws relating to individual insolvency should, as much as possible, be similar to those relating to corporate insolvency. Unfortunately, this has not occurred in the past and this bill does very little to redress the fact that we have a lot of inconsistencies between corporate and individual insolvency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary aim of modern bankruptcy law is to enable the debtor to identify his or her accumulated debts and make whatever contribution is possible and then allow the debtor to make a fresh start. Most people would agree with the basic aims of bankruptcy law. Of course, we often differ on the finer detail. I find it quite amazing that after 12 years of Labor government we now find such a complex bill being brought into this House which follows on from a number of complex amendments to the bankruptcy legislation. It seems that the government has simply not been able to get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of bankruptcy is worth considering. Way back in the 12th century the Anglo-Saxon remedy for debt&mdash;imprisonment&mdash;had been eliminated. The only legal remedies available to creditors were writs directing the sheriff to sell the land or goods of the debtor or to receive rents, proceeds or profits on his behalf. From 1285, an additional writ enabled the sheriff to hold chattels and land on behalf of a creditor until the debt was satisfied. But these remedies took no account of other creditors and certainly provided no relief to hopelessly insolvent debtors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imprisonment was reintroduced at the end of the 13th century and gradually became `arrest until satisfaction'. Given that many creditors were simply unable to satisfy their debts, this amounted to imprisonment for life. I do not think anyone in the country, certainly no-one in the parliament, would support that kind of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the bankruptcy acts was brought in in 1542 and provided the first legal remedy available to creditors as a whole as compared with action taken by an individual creditor. This act and subsequent bankruptcy acts leading right through to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 improved methods of extraction of assets from debtors, endeavoured to provide for a fair distribution and some time later provided relief to debtors themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we approached the 18th century, bankruptcy was coming to be considered as a beneficial course of action not only for the creditor but also for the debtor. Bankruptcy started to be considered to be misfortune rather than fault. Debtors were finally given the power to initiate their own bankruptcies voluntarily. The legislation which we have here is a descendent in effect of those earlier English acts. Individual colonies, later states, of Australia brought forward their own bankruptcy acts, but in 1924 a bankruptcy act of the Commonwealth was enacted. That was an amalgam of the British and colonial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bankruptcy Act 1966 introduced a new consolidated procedure for private arrangements avoiding bankruptcy. In fact, in many respects it was a trailblazer because it deviated from many of the existing English and Australian precedents. The Bankruptcy Act, being the Commonwealth act, now covers everyone in the country. Its provisions override any state act to the contrary to the extent that state legislation is in conflict. Section 109 of the Commonwealth constitution covers this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian bankruptcy legislation provides for control of private arrangements avoiding bankruptcy&mdash;they are known as part X arrangements&mdash;to be carried out under the supervision of private trustees. Until November 1981 control of bankrupt estates was automatically given to official receivers, being public officials appointed for each bankruptcy district. Private trustees could be appointed to administer bankrupt estates only at a meeting of creditors convened after the appointment of the official receiver. In 1987 the act was amended to enable insolvency fraud to be more effectively attacked and to modify part X arrangements so that more information was required to be given to creditors prior to proposal meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this legislation currently before the House is the latest in a series of amendments to the Commonwealth Bankruptcy Act 1966. The government's reaction often relates to decisions made in courts and also reflects changing community attitudes. It would be an understatement to say that there was community outrage at some of the financial defaults by corporate high-fliers, particularly those from the 1980s. It has been suggested that the legislation before the House is a direct result of the case involving Mr Bond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question for the parliament and indeed ultimately at the next election for the entire country is whether the government's response is measured and appropriate. We, when considering this particular piece of legislation, have consulted widely, as is the practice of the coalition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of concerns have been expressed by some of these bodies. That is why I very strongly support the proposal foreshadowed by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who spoke previously, that this whole bill be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.

The government's amendments would allow the ordinary debtor who files for bankruptcy to deal with ITSA alone, and to have more prompt service by the one Commonwealth department. It would mean that the person would not have to go from office to office. The amendment also seeks to avoid duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While one must always encourage any simplification and any reduction in bureaucracy, the recent High Court decision in the Brandy case must obviously raise some concerns. In that decision, the High Court indicated that it is often difficult to separate judicial and administrative functions, apart from the issue of enforceability which is clearly an exercise in judicial power. We certainly have some concerns in relation to what the government is doing here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The date of bankruptcy is said to commence on the occasion of the first act of bankruptcy within six months before the actual date of presentation of the petition. That means that certain transactions are rendered void against a claim by the trustee. In certain cases, property settlements dating back as far as five years can be challenged by the trustee. The law currently looks to the intention of the parties and the nature of settlements. This bill will change the test for deciding whether these prior settlements are immune from claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some concerns over the definition of `technically insolvent', as it catches potential liabilities. This definition could technically catch individuals who, under the principle of joint and several liability, are called upon to provide for the entire sum of a guarantee. We all know how banks, when seeking to guarantee loans, will rope in as many people as they can&mdash;all of whom are jointly and severally liable. Of course, no one individual could possibly pay the entire amount of the liability. The result of that could be that a lot of these people could be dragged in through the proposed amendments to the bill. While a number of people we have consulted have very great concerns over the wording of the provisions, we as a coalition are very worried about the fact that the changes will apply to all bankruptcies which are current when the provisions are finally enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wish to place on record our very strong opposition to retrospectivity in legislation. It is very important that the subject or the citizen be able to order his affairs and to act in accordance with the law today, assuming that a government in the future is not going to retrospectively change the law and make an action which is lawful today retrospectively unlawful. I think that is a very basic principle of democracy. It is fairly sad that this government has once again sought to bring in retrospective legislation. We certainly do not apologise for this. This is one of the matters that the shadow minister foreshadowed ought to be discussed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when it considers this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also refers to insolvency administration outside of actual bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Act, as I mentioned before, provides for part X, which allows for arrangements which are a step short of bankruptcy, such as agreement for a schedule of payment by instalments. The bill amends these procedures to make the procedure the same for both solicitors and trustees who act for debtors who enter into assignments, arrangements or compositions under part X. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also introduce a new form of debt administration which will be known as a part IX debt agreement, which will apply to debtors whose level of liability does not exceed $20,000. This will provide for the circulation of a debtor's proposal for payment of less than the full amount or for periodic payments. This new part is an attempt to simplify proceedings for a debtor where the debtor owes a smaller amount, as it can be done without the additional requirements required for a part X arrangement, such as the necessity to call a meeting, and is done through the Official Trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have certain worries about these amendments, as the legislation will further consolidate the power of ITSA by casting them in both the role of regulator and adviser. Debtors may therefore not get the most objective and best advice, and may not seek their own advice but accept the advice of ITSA. As the shadow minister mentioned, the amount of $20,000 may well be too low and it may be more appropriate to have a higher amount. He suggested $50,000 as an appropriate amount, but it could perhaps be higher. Division 4B of part VI of the Bankruptcy Act was added in 1992. Its purposes were set out in section 139J:</PARA>

<PARA>Unfortunately, for creditors, judicial interpretation has moved the law some distance away from what was apparently intended by the parliament in 1992 when this act became law. A case in reference is Bond v. Ramsay&mdash;a case I referred to a short while ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are apparently in response to the decision of the Federal Court. The shadow minister has outlined the facts and circumstances of the case and the loophole which the Federal Court discovered, requiring in the government's view the amendments currently before the House. In Bond v. Ramsay, the Federal Court ruled that the existing definition of income should be interpreted in a relatively narrow fashion. That meant that Mr Bond was able to get the result he wanted&mdash;although, as was mentioned earlier, this matter has gone on appeal to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key provision is to amend the definition of income in section 139L, which will include the value of a benefit that is provided in any circumstances and the value of a loan made to the bankrupt. This means that a bankrupt who receives payment of legal fees to challenge a decision of the trustee may be required to make an income contribution on the basis that the legal aid would fall within the income definition. The trustee, while having a discretion to exclude certain payments from the income contribution provisions, in reality may rarely exercise this discretion. We are currently discussing whether the term `income' should be widened to include gifts, loans, transfers of property prior to bankruptcy and payments of expenses by benefactors. </PARA>

Unfortunately, in my view, the proposed legislation will fail to achieve some of its aims, may lead to further problems and, at the same time, represents a missed opportunity to effect other much needed changes to the bankruptcy laws. It is entirely appropriate that it should be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, the changes proposed in this bill on which I propose to offer comment are the revision of the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions by which trustees can recover property from third parties who are given property by debtors facing bankruptcy or insolvency and the amendment of the definition of `income' to close the gap highlighted in the Alan Bond case. I will also offer brief comments on the establishment of a one-stop service for bankrupts and insolvent debtors with the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, a division of the Attorney-General's Department, and the abolition of the offices of registrar and deputy registrar in bankruptcy. Other changes I will leave to others. In dealing with the particular aspects of the government's proposals I mentioned, I will comment on the retrospectivity of certain key provisions in the bill and the lack of effectiveness of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal aim of modern bankruptcy law is to enable the debtor to identify his or her accumulated debts, to make whatever contribution is possible and to make a fresh start. This is to be contrasted with the earlier practice of punishing debtors for non-payment of their debts by imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a person becomes bankrupt, all of his or her divisible property vests in the bankruptcy trustee. The bankrupt has no power to deal with the property that has vested in the trustee. It is under the control of the trustee and it is the trustee's task to sell the property and to distribute the proceeds of sale among the creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental feature of the law of bankruptcy is that it operates to enable property and money given or transferred, in certain circumstances, by a person who later becomes a bankrupt to be recovered by the bankruptcy trustee. This property too can then be sold and the proceeds distributed to the bankrupt's creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law presently provides for a period known as `relation back'. The trustee's title to the property is said to relate back to the date of commencement of the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy is taken to commence on the commission by the debtor of the first act of bankruptcy within the period of six months before the presentation of the petition under which the debtor becomes a bankrupt. The trustee may be able to claim property from a person to whom the bankrupt has given it during the relation back period, unless the person who received the property gave something of value in exchange or did not know that a bankruptcy petition had been presented against the debtor and acted in good faith in the ordinary course of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes replacing those sections of the act dealing with transfers of property with a simplified provision under which a transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt is void against the trustee, firstly, if it took place within five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy and, secondly, if the recipient gave nothing of value in exchange or only something that was less than market value. If the transfer took place between two and five years before the commencement of the bankruptcy, the transfer will be valid unless the recipient of the property proves that the transferor was not technically insolvent at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `technically insolvent' is to be defined as a situation where a person's property and income are insufficient to meet the person's liabilities, including any secured liabilities and potential liabilities under a guarantee for another person. This revision of the antecedent transaction avoidance provisions has been criticised by the Law Council of Australia, by the Western Australian Insolvency and Reconstruction Lawyers and by legal practitioners generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a preliminary observation, the Law Council of Australia has said that there is no attempt in this bill to achieve consistency with the provisions of the Corporations Law. In the words of the Law Council:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person deals with a business carried on under a business name, it should make no difference as a matter of law whether the proprietor of the name is a corporation or an individual.</PARA>
<PARA>The major criticism of these amendments, though, is the definition of `technically insolvent', described by the Law Council as `a particularly wide ranging definition and one which is likely to lead to endless debate'. Endless debate means endless litigation and endless expense for individuals. Endless debate also means unnecessary debate and unnecessary expense if, despite all the warnings, this definition is enacted by the parliament in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an illustration of the defects in the proposed definition of `technically insolvent', the Law Council gives the example of a joint and several liability under a guarantee. In such a case, it would be impossible accurately to assess the financial position of any one of the guarantors without investigating the financial position of the others. If there are 10 guarantors who jointly and severally guarantee a debt of $100,000 and the first of those guarantors has assets of $30,000, one would think that person was technically solvent. However, if none of the remaining co-guarantors has any assets, even though the first guarantor has sufficient assets to cover his or her proportionate share of the liability under the guarantee, that person appears to be technically insolvent within the meaning of the proposed definition by reason of the joint liability. In the words of the Law Council:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is undesirable to have a definition of insolvency which cannot produce a certain result and requires an investigation into the financial position of others. The shortcomings of the existing provisions do not arise out of any difficulty with the concept of solvency.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the Law Council is of the view that the proposed amendments to the provisions relating to antecedent property transactions are likely to result in unjust outcomes because the requirement that the recipient of the property must have given at least market value in exchange will affect innocent recipients. For example, an arms-length purchaser who is fortunate enough to purchase an asset at a bargain price within the two years prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy will be forced by the provisions contained in the bill to disgorge the asset and be left with a mere right to prove in the bankruptcy for the price paid. As a result, it will never be safe to purchase at a discount on the full market price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impossibility of this situation is compounded by the fact that the legal burden of proof rests on the recipient. The burden of proving that the transferor was not technically insolvent would compel the recipient to have knowledge of the bankrupt's property and income and liabilities, including potential liabilities under guarantees at the time the property was transferred. In most cases, it will be practically impossible for an arms-length recipient of property, entirely unacquainted with the detail of the transferor's financial circumstances and having no means of knowing the solvency of persons whose debts the transferor may have guaranteed, to prove that the transferor was not technically insolvent at the time of the transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a means of deterring litigation, such obstacles may be very effective. Unfortunately, as barriers to access to justice they will be equally effective. In the words of the Law Council of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This must necessarily lead to an erosion of commercial confidence, because arm's length purchasers will not know for at least five years whether or not the transfer is inviolable unless they have full and complete information concerning the whole of the transferor's financial circumstances and financial circumstances of persons whose debts the transferor has guaranteed and independent evidence of the objective market value of the asset transferred.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill makes the proposed amendments to the antecedent transactions provisions of the act effectively retrospective. It does this by applying the new provisions to all bankruptcies that are current when the new provisions commence. The explanatory memorandum describes a current bankruptcy to include one in which a final dividend has not yet been paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where property has been transferred without fraud, there does not appear to be any good reason why transactions which do not breach the existing antecedent transactions provisions of the act should be under threat. Some of the transactions connected with current bankruptcies may have taken place up to five years before the bankruptcy commenced. Thus, where administration of the bankruptcy has taken time, the retrospective reach of the bill may extend back more than five years. The Law Council of Australia recommends that any new provisions apply only to property transactions that occur after the commencement of the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is yet another example of this government's penchant for retrospectivity. As I have said in this place on several occasions before, retrospectivity in legislation is invidious in principle. I support the principle of prospectively tightening the bankruptcy law so that artificial property transactions aimed at defeating creditors are rendered void as against the bankruptcy trustee. But whenever the government seeks to legislate in the way these proposals contemplate, it takes away the rights of Australians retrospectively. Purchasers and other recipients of property were entitled to arrange their affairs according to the law, including bankruptcy law, as it existed when they transacted their business. It is simply unjust and oppressive to subject citizens to a law they have no means of ascertaining simply because the law has not been conceived, drafted or enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia has pointed out that there is a further, practical reason why the new provisions should apply only to transactions occurring after the commencement of the new provisions. Where there are court proceedings already on foot, a party may perceive that it would serve its interests to delay the proceedings pending the commencement of the new provisions. The parties' pleadings in those proceedings may, in any event, have to be totally redrafted if the case is not to be heard until after the commencement of the proposed amendments. Again, the expense and delay that this would cause is an added unnecessary burden to those who resort to the court system for justice and the enforcement of their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further key proposal in the bill is the revision of the compulsory income contribution scheme following the decision of the Federal Court in the case of Bond v. Ramsay. The scheme commenced operation on 1 July 1992, replacing an earlier, ineffective system. The income contribution scheme is an administrative regime under which a trustee makes an assessment of the income likely to be derived by a bankrupt during a certain period. Where the assessment of income exceeds a specified threshold the bankrupt is liable to pay half of every dollar he or she earns over and above that amount. The term `income' is defined to include various payments received, including a benefit that is, or if it were provided by an employer would be, a fringe benefit for the purposes of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the public criticism of the bankruptcy law in the 1990s has been directed at the supposed inadequacy of the scheme. This is because some bankrupts appear to be able to maintain a lifestyle which is lavish by comparison with that of ordinary solvent individuals, and are able to conduct expensive litigation which depletes the assets available for contribution to their creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these bankrupts have benefactors, including friends and family members, who meet the expenses and outgoings of the bankrupt. A bankrupt should not be allowed to benefit from gifts or expense payments in circumstances where to do so would be to exclude unjustly his or her creditors from the benefit of those resources. This may be the case when the benefactor has in earlier times been the recipient of property transferred to him or her from the now bankrupt, thus putting him or her in a financial position to assist the bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is by no means self-evident that it is a basic intent of the current legislation that if a person makes a payment of money from that person's own property to benefit a bankrupt&mdash;for example, to pay his or her legal fees in order that the bankrupt may defend himself or herself in legal proceedings&mdash;the amount of any such payment is to be regarded as income coming to the bankrupt. In his judgment in the Bond case, Justice Cooper, a member of the majority, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not an object within . . . the [Bankruptcy] Act to prevent bona fide acts of benefaction from the family or friends of a bankrupt using their own money or property.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the same point that was made in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 4 November 1994 by Mr Ron Harmer, who was formerly the commissioner in charge of the Australian Law Reform Commission's general insolvency inquiry which reported in 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia has recommended that if benefits are to be classed as income, then only those benefits which contribute to the bankrupt's lifestyle, such as houses, cars and expensive holidays, should be taken into account. Justice Cooper warned in the Bond case of the consequences of adopting a too broad definition of income. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . [receiving benefits in excess of the income limit] alone renders the bankrupt liable to assessment for contribution to his estate whether or not he has any capacity to pay the contribution and exposes him to the serious consequence of non-payment of the contribution. In principle this would seem to occur where the funds for the legal services were provided by family and friends or by a Legal Aid Commission briefing out and paying for the provision of legal services for the bankrupt, notwithstanding that the bankrupt was at the relevant time not employed and not in receipt of income and satisfied the means test applicable to the grant of legal aid.</PARA>
<PARA>The act and this bill give the trustee no discretion to ameliorate the harsh consequences that the proposed definition in the bill might produce. The consequences of failing to pay an income assessment are serious, including an automatic extension of the term of the bankruptcy from three years to eight years, the commission of an offence and the survival beyond the bankruptcy of the obligation to pay the assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes in the bill to amend the definition of `income', principally because of the decision in the Bond case. In the Bond case the Federal Court decided that the definition of `income' in the act did not include the value of benefits provided to a bankrupt other than in an employment context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of this clear judicial interpretation, the government, in an exercise of breathtaking arrogance, states in the explanatory memorandum to the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the income contribution scheme was devised, it was intended to catch the value of gifts, payments of expenses and similar benefits provided to or on account of a bankrupt by benefactors, whether or not the bankrupt was employed by, or worked or provided services for or on behalf of the benefactor.</PARA>
<PARA>The government then complains about the decision of the court in Bond v. Ramsay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not only refusing to accept the umpire's decision, but is attempting, once again, to rewrite the rule-book. As the Law Council of Australia has said of the government's interpretation of the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is little in the legislation or in any extrinsic material from which such a purpose or intention can be evinced.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed definition of income seeks to remove the requirement for a benefit to be provided `in respect of employment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new definition of income includes the value of a benefit that `is a benefit within the meaning of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986'. However, as the Law Council points out, for a benefit to come within the meaning of that act it must be provided under an arrangement in relation to `the performance of work'. Thus an employment nexus must still exist, and so the problems revealed by the Bond case may not be solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the amendment may, in addition, create a problem. The Bankruptcy Act draws a distinction between its treatment of the `property' of a bankrupt and the `income' of a bankrupt. As I said earlier, in general terms, property owned by a bankrupt at the commencement of the bankruptcy vests in the trustee for the benefit of creditors. After-acquired property also vests in the trustee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed expanded definition of income raises the prospect of an overlap between those provisions of the act dealing with after-acquired property and those dealing with income. In aiming to catch receipts by the bankrupt of a capital nature within the definition of income, for the purposes of the income contribution scheme, such receipts may thereby be excluded from the meaning of after-acquired property for the purposes of property divisible among the creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further concern highlighted by the Law Council is that the bill provides in the proposed definition of income that any provision of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act can be amended by regulation for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act. The Law Council says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This delegation of legislative power should be condemned and may be open to constitutional challenge.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly there are better ways of drafting such a crucial definition. As the government claims to know how the legislation was intended to be interpreted, it should be a simple matter for it to have the appropriate definition drafted in the primary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is yet another problem. The bill introduces a new limb to the definition of income which makes the value of loans made to the bankrupt by an associated entity of the bankrupt assessable as income. In its explanatory memorandum, the government seeks to justify this on the basis that bankrupts commonly abuse the income assessment provisions by disguising as loans the funds advanced to them by associated entities which are, in reality, gifts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision is drafted in such a way that it appears to include genuine loans. As I suggested at the beginning, one of the purposes of the bankruptcy laws is to promote the financial rehabilitation of bankrupts. It is obviously very difficult for an undischarged bankrupt to borrow money. In these circumstances, a loan from a family member may be the only possibility. There is no reason why bona fide loans by associated entities should automatically be assessed as income of the bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the problem with this broadening of the definition of income is that an advance of cash to the bankrupt by an associated entity would normally vest in the trustee as after-acquired property for the benefit of the creditors. By including a loan in the form of such a cash advance in the definition of income, it is likely to remain the bankrupt's, subject only to the income contribution scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Administration and oversight of bankruptcy matters is carried out by Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA. However, the Federal Court of Australia plays an essential role in the determination of rights and obligations under bankruptcy law. In addition, certain administrative tasks, such as the issue of bankruptcy notices, are the responsibility of the registrars in bankruptcy who are located within the Federal Court. The public thus has to deal with two separate Commonwealth bodies, namely, the Federal Court's registrar in bankruptcy and ITSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes the abolition of the offices of registrar and deputy registrar in bankruptcy and the transfer of their administrative functions to ITSA to establish a one-stop service. I have some concerns about this expanded role for ITSA. The proposals in the bill relating to part X arrangements would allow ITSA to be a trustee of those arrangements while also being a controlling trustee. If ITSA is to be responsible for administering bankrupt estates and the estates of debtors under part X arrangements and at the same time exercising a supervisory role over the conduct of private trustees, there is a clear possibility of conflicts of interest. With the abolition of the office of registrar in bankruptcy, ITSA's conflicts of interest may become more pronounced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ITSA is to have this expanded role, it must show that it is capable of performing the various functions efficiently and fairly. Concerns have been raised with me by constituents about the lack of efficiency within ITSA in terms of both the way it operates and the profit it generates. Certainly, something needs explaining about the budget figures for ITSA for 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 24 of Budget Paper No. 2  gives a budget estimate of receipts for the Attorney-General's Department under the item `Bankruptcy' of $10.553 million. Page 46 of the program analysis for the Attorney-General's portfolio gives a budget estimate of total outlays for ITSA for 1995-96 of $20.741 million. At the least this requires an explanation from the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the government has failed to address an area of much needed reform. Significantly, the bill does not address the situation of debtors who flee the jurisdiction in order to avoid the reach of their creditors and Australian bankruptcy law. The Law Council submitted to the 1993 reform discussion papers which preceded this bill that, where a debtor has left Australia never to return and has no other connection with Australia, the creditor may be unable to present a bankruptcy petition because of the requirement that a debtor must be personally present or ordinarily resident in Australia at the time of the commission of the act of bankruptcy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) made an excellent and very thoughtful contribution in which he raised some points which are of concern. I hope these points are considered by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) or that at least the minister adequately addresses them. However, I fear that this legislation has been driven in part by genuflections of the high profile instances we have had of corporate impropriety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Bonds and the Skases have made a big impact in the media. It is my view that the worst excesses have been by the banks. The attitude and behaviour of the banks, particularly in the late 1980s, has in my view been quite reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me, I want to raise a matter which is very germane to the discussion but which is not covered by the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill. I refer to the action of agents and mortgagees in possession. A secured creditor can get hold of a person's income stream. There seems to be very little control over these people. I am aware of many instances where the behaviour of these people has been absolutely culpable. People's lives have been destroyed by the actions of incompetent agents in possession who run up enormous bills which have to be paid by the mortgagor. In many cases, this destroys businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned some of these cases before. Citibank v. the Kalgoorlie Hotel and Bob Couzens was one such case. The bank put the property up for mortgage. It got an offer of $400,000, which it then rejected. Some 12 months later, after running up enormous debts, the bank sold the property for much less money. I believe there should be a facility there to sue Citibank, but that is not available. In most of these cases, bankruptcy inevitably follows, but the unsecured creditors are completely shafted; there is no protection whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Commonwealth Development Bank v. Boulder Brick and Tile, which I mentioned in the House the other night, Mr Lloyd Hirst had the facilities, through a friend, to pursue the matter. After much trouble, he has got a court decision saying that he can sue the Commonwealth Development Bank for the losses incurred as its actions were illegal and unprincipled at the time. At the time that occurred, I spoke to the Commonwealth Development Bank about its behaviour, and it was adamant that it was going to make this business pay. If one looks at the details, which I have not got time to go into, one can see that its behaviour was quite thuggish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is also the case with R&amp;I when it put an agent in possession of Goultpro, an operation in Kalgoorlie. The receiver manager in that case told me that this was such a good business that he was going to run it and make a large profit. It was working profitably and it was actually meeting the payments at the time, and the R&amp;I Bank used subterfuge to get in as the agent in possession. The long and the short of the story is that the agent in possession wrecked the business, ran it at an enormous loss, lost the money for the R&amp;I and lost all the money for the unsecured creditors, which was a highly predictable situation and was almost guaranteed to occur when you get these accountants going into businesses that require a technical expertise which they simply do not have. Nothing in this legislation goes to protect people from the rapacious attitude of banks in these sorts of situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have grave concerns about the present process of bankruptcy, and I am not sure that it is going to be addressed by amendments to this bill. Recently, a person in Perth was declared bankrupt without any thorough investigation of her financial position. From the balance sheets I have seen of this business&mdash;I must say that they are not complete&mdash;it seems to me that there is a very good chance that the person in question was not insolvent, but bankruptcy pursued her and that woman will be now entirely ruined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her predicament has been complicated by a leading Perth law firm which was unable to provide the title when she wanted to clear one of her mortgages, and it was unable to provide the title through its own incompetence. Because it delayed for some time, she lost a source of income&mdash;all sorts of money that was going to pay for this affair. Eventually, she became bankrupt, when it is quite clear that the behaviour of that legal firm was certainly in large part responsible for her predicament. She has absolutely no way of fighting the firm. Legal aid will not assist people in these sorts of situations, and she does not have the resources. Those firms can simply waste people by delaying litigation and by using all the legal devices and subterfuges that can be used. That is not addressed in this bill either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the member for Tangney did make a very good contribution. I thought it was well thought out and I think the points he raised do have some merit. I will be looking with interest to see how the minister responds to what I think are substantial objections to this bill in its present form. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, I raise my concern for citizens of my electorate who live near or work at the Australian National site at the Islington rail yards, Kilburn. This has been a sorry story of neglect&mdash;a story of waste being dumped, when the dangers to future generations were not fully realised, and the tragedy of that practice continuing, despite the state laws governing the disposal of waste. It is a story of cover-up, cop-out and buck-passing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian National took over this site in July 1975 from the Dunstan government. Prior to that time and since then, up until at least 1985&mdash;and some workers say after that&mdash;waste, including large quantities of asbestos, solid cyanide, acids, lead and arsenic, have been disposed of at the Islington rail yards. South Australia's Environment Protection Authority says that there are more than 200,000 tonnes of waste at this site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The saga of this site is extraordinary. Time does not permit me to record each step which has been taken to highlight the problem. Workers and residents have been ignored by AN. I have in my possession letters dated March 1985, from the Waste Management Commission in South Australia to both AN and the then Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Environment, expressing `serious concern with regard to the waste disposal practices which have taken place' at the site of the Islington rail yards. Over a considerable length of time residents and workers have been concerned for their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last December I spoke in this place calling on the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to face up to his ministerial responsibilities and bring AN into line. Since then, I have been involved in a series of meetings and have highlighted the issues in the media. Last week the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> covered the story on three days, and then did so again today. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> also drew attention to the plight of workers who have suffered asbestos related diseases and the campaign under way to force AN into a satisfactory clean-up of the site. The ABC and commercial radio and television have also covered these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the site received publicity late last year, AN suddenly decided that it had no further use for this land, this poisoned chalice, and that it could be handed back to the state government. AN management stated its intention to cap the site but not clean it up. Not surprisingly, the South Australian government has legal advice to the effect that it does not have to take back this contaminated land in its present state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I argue that AN has behaved in a way that has shown scant regard for workers and residents. It ignored state legislation, and it is interesting to quote the South Australian Waste Management Act of 1979 under which AN operated. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any premises to be used for the purpose of the reception, storage treatment or disposal of waste must be licensed as a depot . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . requiring the occupier of the depot to carry out proper procedures relating to waste management and to take proper precautions to prevent or minimise environmental damage . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It further continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where a depot is not licensed as required by this section, or a condition of a licence relating to a depot is not complied with, the occupier of the depot shall be guilty of an offence . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Under a section headed `Control of undesirable practices', the act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1) Where the Commissioner is satisfied&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) that a person has failed to comply with this Act and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) that in consequence</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) a nuisance or offensive condition</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) conditions injurious to health or safety</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) damage to the environment has been caused or is threatened</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commissioner may by order in writing served upon that person, require him to carry out, or to refrain from carrying out any action specified in the order.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, AN would argue that, because it is a Commonwealth authority, it is immune from such laws. But a senior officer of the South Australia EPA puts it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AN has benefited in the past from disposal practices which, if they had been carried out by the private sector, would have led to prosecution. At best their approach has been irresponsible and unethical. Under no circumstances should the state have to bear the cost of these practices.</PARA>
<PARA>In a Senate estimates committee meeting Senator Faulkner wriggled out of questioning from Senator Kemp on his responsibility for this toxic dump with the excuse that `the issue is a matter for Mr Brereton who is the Minister for Transport'. But the Minister for Transport has been variously reported as saying that he is still considering the matter or that the matter is for AN alone. Now I am calling on the disinterested Minister for Transport to realise his responsibility and announce his plans for the clean-up of the Islington rail yards. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We hear a lot from this government about its alleged concern for the Aussie battler. But almost every day in my electorate I hear stories of people who are genuinely in need of support from the government but unable to obtain it. The following story demonstrates how arrogant this government has become. A young mother in Port Lincoln has been battling with the Department of Social Security and the appeals tribunal for two years. She has been applying for the child disability allowance for her young son who has a severe gastro-reflux condition which has seen him in and out of hospital since being born.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To obtain the CDA, the child requires a greater than ordinary level of care than another child of the same age. The child's condition must also be ongoing. Looking at this mother's case, I truly believe she fits these criteria. However, her application has been rejected time and again. On the question of needing more than the normal level of care, this child has been in and out of hospital and has great difficulty in eating and sleeping normally. He requires almost constant comforting and attention to help him cope with the pain that he is going through. He also requires a list of medication which is essential but also expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second count of the condition being ongoing, since this little boy was born&mdash;two years ago&mdash;he has suffered from this same condition. He has been in and out of the hospital, with the latest visit being last month. How much more ongoing does his condition have to be before the department will recognise him? It is important to note that other children who suffer from severe reflux have been able to qualify for CDA. Fitting into the criteria stated above can be a very subjective task. Who is to say that this baby does not require more care than the ordinary child? Who is to say that his condition has not been ongoing? Yet that is what the DSS and the appeals tribunal have found. The mother tells me that the doctor who gave evidence at the appeals tribunal was not even a paediatrician. However, her doctor, who is a paediatrician, also gave evidence to the tribunal. Her doctor stated his belief that the son did require more than the ordinary level of care. Why did the tribunal prefer the Commonwealth doctor's opinion to the paediatrician's opinion?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very sad thing about this case is that the mother in question has had two battles on her hands over the past two years. Not only has she had to cope with the stress associated with her son's condition; she has come up against a government which will not assist her with her medical and travel costs and will not even acknowledge that there is a problem. The mother has continually had to travel between her home in Port Lincoln and Adelaide to obtain medical care for her son and to deal with the DSS and the appeals tribunal. It has been a harrowing and frustrating two years. The final irony is that her second son has the same condition and may well require the same ongoing level of care and medical attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing she is asking is that the government listen to her. She has asked but so far the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has totally ignored this request. I received a letter from the parliamentary secretary last week saying that there is no further purpose in discussing this case. The mother is angry about being brushed off. She is a taxpayer and has been told that she has no right to discuss this matter further. On her behalf, I ask the minister to come out of his ivory tower in Canberra and take a look at what is happening in some of these appeals tribunals because the Australian battler is losing out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can tell that an election is not too far away from the antics of the opposition in the last week or so. In many ways it is not unusual for the opposition to carry on the way that it has. We have seen the outrageous hypocrisy over the French nuclear testing from the opposition. It is as though suddenly the opposition has discovered that nuclear tests are a bad thing. It wants to take the moral and political high ground from the Labor Party, which has had a track record of commitment to this issue for 20 or 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not heard the opposition talk very much about the attitude of the Menzies government when the British tests at Maralinga took place. Some opposition members have rather selective memories, particularly the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). I recall his righteous indignation about the government's position, the Left's position and everyone else's position in the Labor Party. The father of the honourable member for Mayo was a member of the Menzies cabinet when the Maralinga tests were carried out. The member for Mayo criticised the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) by saying that he would have been making a lot more noise if it had been the British government carrying out nuclear testing at Mururoa. Of course, it was the British government which carried out tests at Maralinga in the far north of South Australia and we do not hear much from the opposition about that. It is funny about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the hypocrisy of the opposition trying to oppose the government's amendments to the child-care legislation. Even though we concede that there is some genuine concern in the community about the people's perceptions of the measures outlined in that legislation, the opposition once again has jumped on the bandwagon trying to take the high moral ground over child care&mdash;of all things! For the opposition to be moralistic about any social policy introduced by this government is a joke, particularly concerning child care. The opposition seemed to forget about child care during the 1993 election campaign until the last minute when it realised that it would be subject to a 15 per cent GST. The opposition had to change its policy and produce Fightback II to exclude child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On most issues the opposition is years behind community opinion. In the past the Labor Party, particularly those in the Left, have been criticised for being ahead of public opinion in terms of social reforms and social policy. I think this government has got it pretty right over the last few years. We can be criticised in a few areas for going too fast or too slow. With regard to keeping up with public opinion and community opinion on social policy, the opposition is years and years behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more glaring examples of hypocrisy on the coalition side is its continual pursuit of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), particularly from those in Western Australia. There is now a royal commission in Western Australia, which is clearly a political kangaroo court and a witch hunt trying to discredit a federal Labor minister who happens to be a former Premier of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that there is an election coming, but it is also clear that the opposition has no policies. It has nothing to go to the people with. It jumps on the bandwagon about French tests and takes every opportunity to score points, but it has nothing to offer the people of Australia, other than to cling to the monarchy, states rights and all those shibboleths of the Menzies era. After its 50 or 51 years of existence&mdash;whatever it is now&mdash;it has nothing to go to the people with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the government has much to fear in the next election. We have been here for 12 years&mdash;and it might be 13 years by the time the election comes up&mdash;but I think you will find that the people of Australia will once again re-elect a Labor government, because the opposition has nothing to offer contemporary Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to bring to the federal parliament's attention a great character of Broken Hill and the Western Division of New South Wales and a great Australian, Ron Nancarrow, who passed away on 4 May 1995. Ron was born disabled in Broken Hill in 1915 and spent various periods in hospital during his first 10 years of life. His condition resulted in Ron having to spend most of his life on crutches and, in the last 10 years of his life, Ron was restricted to a wheelchair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the age of 18, Ron opened a boot making and repair shop in the back room of his parents' home, but this was unsuccessful. His next job was to demolish facilities on a mine site at Broken Hill using expertise he had gained from watching demolition teams from his bed on the verandah of a Sydney hospital. He later obtained other demolition contracts in the Western Division, acting as a supervisor for the labourers and instructing them in his demolition methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of Ron's spirit was shown when he obtained a job with a contractor and worked on his knees with a pick and shovel helping to dig the footings of the Broken Hill Hospital. The legend is that he was taunted by other labourers, as he made them look silly because he managed to dig more holes than they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Second World War broke out, Ron tried to enlist in the army but failed on medical grounds. He then enlisted in the RAAF as a cook but, when he travelled to Adelaide, the authorities saw he was disabled and informed him that his expertise was not required. He then joined British Tube Mills and obtained a job as an examiner for the Owen Bren gun, but was later manpowered from this job to Mootoroo Station as a cook and then leading hand and bookkeeper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later Ron bought a block in Menindee, now part of the Menindee Lake system, on the Darling River in western New South Wales and had 5,000 tomato plants ready to harvest when two freak cyclones on consecutive days wiped out his crop. Not to be disheartened, Ron obtained a job with the zinc corporation as a cook on a field group called Enterprise Exploration and, with that company, travelled to the now well-known Moomba gas field searching for oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ron later became a traveller for Benjamins, a Broken Hill store, travelling to all parts of the Western Division. He later opened a commercial agency and a debt collection service. Over the years, Ron was secretary of the Sunset Strip progress association of Menindee Lake and held that position for 15 major development years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He nominated as an alderman of the Broken Hill City Council and was elected in 1974 and served the city with honour. Ron retired from his business in 1975 but kept up many interests, including being chairman and vice-chairman of the National Party in Broken Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ron had many interests but two great loves. His first great love was his family and, in particular, his wife, Jule, without whose loving care Ron would have found life to be infinitely more difficult. His second great love was the Australian bush and the people of the outback&mdash;in particular, he loved Broken Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He joined the National Party in Broken Hill because he believed that to survive the city needed a new approach. On many occasions, the course he took did not enamour him with many people in the existing establishment. It must be said however that all who knew him&mdash;including his political enemies&mdash;admired his guts and tenacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thing I will remember about Ron was his integrity and courage. Ron expected all people to live up to the level of honour and integrity that guided his life, and this was asking a great deal from any person. I regarded Ron as a personal friend whose advice I always appreciated, and I will sorely miss him. I am sure members would join with me in offering condolences to Jule and Ron's family. I will miss this great Australian character, as I am sure many, particularly those in Broken Hill and the Western Division, will also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the federated structure of the University of Western Sydney, which is in my electorate of Werriwa. There has been a recent controversy about the university's future, with elements within the Nepean campus arguing that the federation should be dissolved and Nepean should establish itself as a separate university. There are three very good reasons why this should not happen and why the University of Western Sydney should continue with a federated structure. First, it is only a young university, not yet six years old. It is yet to reach its best economy of scale in terms of attracting quality research and teaching staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a benefit for the university to continue its development within its federated structure to gain the status and prestige needed to upgrade the quality of its research and teaching staff. That should be a very important objective for each of the university managers and professional staff. In many respects, the university is yet to fulfil its promise within its current structure. The people of western Sydney, while inspired and holding great hopes for the future of the university, are now looking for the hard edge of results. Those results can best be achieved within the federated structure that was adopted in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for maintaining the current structure is that the component parts of the university&mdash;the three campuses, Nepean, Hawkesbury and Macarthur&mdash;in their own right would be much too small to sustain a university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the university's 1993 annual report. At that time Hawkesbury had 4,500 students and four faculties, Macarthur had 6,500 students and five faculties and Nepean had 10,000 students and seven faculties. Each of those campuses would be much too small to justify a university that in turn could achieve the economy of scale and the status and prestige needed to do the region justice. So it is too small in the component parts. Those figures make the point that Nepean, far from being disadvantaged by the current arrangements, has been the great beneficiary. It has had the largest student enrolment, the highest number of teaching staff, the highest number of faculties and the most amount of government funding support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no argument that Nepean has in some way been disadvantaged out of the federated structure. It is far from being the poor cousin of the University of Western Sydney. It may well have been upset by some of the recent decisions&mdash;for instance, to allocate the law school to the Macarthur campus adjoining my electorate&mdash;but in the long haul of funding decisions Nepean has no reason to object to the federated structure. If it were to be established as a university in its own right, it would leave the ridiculous circumstance of Hawkesbury, in the north-west of Sydney, being actually geographically separated from the Macarthur campus in the south-west of Sydney. So Hawkesbury and Macarthur could not survive collectively as a new university. They would have to split into an arrangement whereby Western Sydney would go from one to three universities. It is completely untenable in the geography and the current status and size of the university and each of the faculties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason for maintaining the federation is that the university should see strength in a federated structure. Other parts of the world&mdash;I suppose most notably, the Sorbonne in Paris&mdash;have demonstrated how there can be strength in a federation. It can cater for diversity among each of the three campuses and the large greater western Sydney region, yet still benefit from the scale, prestige and the economies that arise from a single university status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the future, there is to be an internal review of the university structure. The university and its administrators should have regard for recent announcements by the federal and state ministers, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and John Aquilina. I congratulate them for wanting to maintain the university in its current structure and to see it grow, prosper and progress for the student body and aspirations of western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I declare my confidence for the new vice-chancellor, Professor Schroeder. He is a very talented person and has every opportunity to produce better results for the university as it progresses in years to come. If anything, I would encourage federal and state members of parliament representing the region to continue the lobbying effort to make sure there is a redistribution of funding for teaching, research and capital purposes to give our growth region its best chance, capitalising on the benefits of federation&mdash;the prestige, status and economy of scale&mdash;but also enjoying the benefits of diversity from having three campuses acting in a coordinated and sensible fashion. </PARA>

Finally they could have an adjacent major supermarket, as well as a good variety of specialist stores. However, the 14,000-plus residents of Carrum Downs and Skye urgently require an Australia Post licensed post office in one of the businesses at the shopping centre. At such a large regional facility, there is an expectation that an Australia Post outlet should be there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the National Australia Bank is considering whether to be the first bank to open at the centre.

However, it is not designed for retail customers. </PARA>

To get to the Lathams Road Australia Post facility, mothers have to struggle with their prams along, firstly, the divided Hall Road, cross the busy Frankston-Dandenong road and then walk along the undivided Lathams Road, which lacks a footpath. In wet weather, the journey is even harder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Downs centre manager, Christine Grayland, wrote to Australia Post on 6 December and on 29 December 1994 Australia Post's area support office in Frankston wrote back saying:</PARA>

<PARA>Since March, Mr Barry Waterford of the Carrum Downs newsagency&mdash;itself a business that has relocated from another address to be part of this new shopping centre&mdash;has organised a petition with close to 5,000 signatures of local residents or users of the shopping centre. That petition has been or is in the process of being forwarded to Australia Post. The petition calls on Australia Post to establish an outlet within the Carrum Downs shopping centre in the interests of safety and convenience. I support this petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post's former agent at Carrum Downs onsold that licence some 12 months ago to the operator of the Belvedere Park newsagency. At that time, a non-standard clause was inserted in the licensed post office agreement which said that the Belvedere Park newsagent has the first option over relocation to the Carrum Downs regional shopping centre, although he must then give up his post office facilities at Belvedere Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post is keen to avoid too many licensed post offices. It fears that it might end up in court. Certainly, the Belvedere Park licensee paid a substantial amount to commence his business. It seems to me that Australia Post has got itself into some trouble by inserting this non-standard clause. After all, Belvedere Park is not within walking distance for many Carrum Downs or Skye residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post should be awarding licences by open public tender rather than inserting unusual clauses that could be read as giving the go-ahead for under-the-counter arrangements. Cranbourne, rightly, now has two post offices with the Thompson Parkway shopping centre outlet opening in the past year. Hallam has a new licensed post office, as does Blind Bight. Why can Carrum Downs not have just one Australia Post outlet? There is more demand for a post office at the Carrum Downs regional shopping centre than there is at Belvedere Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Peter Hansen of Australia Post gave an undertaking to my office on 30 May that he would investigate this matter urgently, rather than defer its consideration for six to 12 months as had been envisaged by Australia Post.

Over the last few years, local government authorities across Australia&mdash;and their residents&mdash;have learned just what this means in practice when planning issues are concerned.

The motion went on to call on the government to review the draft telecommunications national code and the Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations from both an environmental and historic perspective.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, in relation to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995, I foreshadowed that the approach that the opposition intended to take was to identify the three areas of possible contention and to flag our desire to have a review of matters in relation to those three areas, preferably in the Senate by the Senate committee on community affairs. I identified those areas as the amendments that clarify the qualification requirements for the disability support pension and disability wage supplement, the provision that native title rights and interests are not to be taken into account when applying the assets test in the act, and the amendment in relation to split compensation payments and the application of provisions to claimants and assessment of periodic and lump sum compensation provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be seeking to divide on these issues in committee. It may well be, after the examination of one or other of these proposed amendments, that we will not oppose them. I will not foreshadow that we can be convinced in relation to all of the matters that have been raised, but it may well be that we are open to persuasion in relation to one of them or perhaps two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter that I wanted to advert to in particular is related to the question of split settlements. In 1993 the government sought unsuccessfully to make amendments to the compensation provisions in the act. It was the subject of a good deal of discussion which involved myself and the Minister for Social Security as we sought to work around what we see as a difficulty for the government in relation to the way in which compensation matters are dealt with. I also flagged very clearly a view I have, which my colleagues share, that, where people receive compensation payments which are clearly related to non-income earning aspects of damage they may have suffered, there ought not to be a preclusion period which takes into account compensation received for what might have been pain and suffering, out-of-pocket expenses or other expenses of a like character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not deny that there have been some situations in which the lump sum preclusion period can operate, particularly in settlements where the matters are largely in people's own hands and are not the subject of independent review, where people have sought to put the compensation arrangements in a form which will exclude the operation of the preclusion period. That is fairly obvious and that is why the government wants to address the issue. But it was inadequate to simply move to address this issue, as the government proposed before, by a 50 per cent rule which no longer required payments to have an economic component in order for the rule to apply and therefore half of any lump sum would be treated as an income related payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not come back with an amendment to achieve that purpose, which was the approach that was taken before. The government now proposes that, if a person receives more than one payment arising out of the same event and at least one of the payments is for lost earnings or a lost earnings capacity, the person will be taken to receive one lump sum, to which the 50 per cent rule will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that the amendment is necessary, due to the current trend in the management of compensation payments, as I have mentioned, when one settlement for a low amount is made in respect of a loss of earnings and earnings capacity and a larger amount is expressed in respect of non-economic loss, for pain and suffering. The larger amount is not covered by the compensation recovery positions, as it does not fall within the definition of compensation. The government has told us about a case before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in which the tribunal recommended that legislation be amended to close this loophole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this amendment is not the same as the amendment proposed in 1993, it does, in our view, similarly seek to undermine the integrity of the non-economic component of a compensation payment. The Welfare Rights Movement, the South Australian body that advises on social security issues, and the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia have criticised this amendment on the basis that it undermines legal settlements made between parties and undermines the purpose of pain and suffering settlement by treating money received for non-economic losses the same as money to compensate for loss of earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter can be the subject of further deliberation, but it seems to me that in all of these questions there needs to be a way in which the genuine cases where people have been compensated only for pain and suffering, and where there is no element of economic loss or a minimal element of economic loss, can be dealt with. These circumstances can arise in relation to people involved in accidents who have next to no income, who may be unemployed, who may be totally reliant upon social security payments. The argument that there may be only limited numbers of people affected by a measure of this sort does not, in my judgment, justify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I would encourage the advisers to the government, who seem to be keen to bring this matter back time and time again, to display a little lateral thinking, to find a mechanism that addresses the problem that has clearly been identified and about which we have indicated a certain resolution of view in ensuring that it is dealt with in a way which is demonstrably fair to all parties. We do not want to see the revenue ripped off by people who are fabricating circumstances which are not the case, but we do want to see a situation in which those who are entitled to compensation for pain and suffering have it treated as compensation for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, so far as the handling of this matter is concerned, we will obviously seek to have the first matters that I addressed&mdash;the issues relating to the disability support pension and the disability wage, the provisions to clarify the meaning of work and the 20 per cent impairment issue&mdash;referred to the Senate committee. We have flagged that we are open to persuasion from either side on those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very powerful arguments have been advanced, particularly by the welfare rights movement. They ought to be heard. The department has given me written advice&mdash;and I do not think it is before the parliament at this stage&mdash;as to how it believes these matters will be addressed. It may well be important that in its deliberations the Senate is aware that the department has a view about the way in which these matters will be addressed. I will just quote what I believe to be the relevant sections. The department had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, it should be noted that the Social Security Act is `beneficial' legislation. Where there is an ambiguity in the Act and there is no contrary intention in the Second Reading speech or the explanatory memorandum, that ambiguity will generally be interpreted in favour of the client. Accordingly, cases not specifically excluded under the proposed amendments may be settled in favour of a client. As stated above, the amendment will not prevent lack of motivation being taken into account under these amendments. What is required, however, is that the lack of motivation is part of another illness that is assigned a rating under the Impairment Tables, for example, clinical depression.</PARA>
<PARA>That issue is one through which I believe it may be possible by further elucidation to address some of the concerns that have been raised by the groups. I think it is important that this question be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of us understand that, particularly where people have suffered a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment, there can be an addition to that impairment of an attitudinal problem&mdash;lack of motivation&mdash;which needs to be taken into account. At times, the issue of distinguishing sufficiently, in clinical terms, a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment which is a necessary pre-condition may be a fairly daunting task. In the context of some of the clinical difficulties and the need to ensure that people who clearly have lack of motivation to seek employment might be able to continue to access a disability support pension, the arguments that have been advanced in relation to that are quite persuasive. With the assurances that have been given by the department perhaps spelt out sufficiently clearly so that those who do have to consider these issues will have some further information beyond that which is presently contained within the explanatory memorandum and that which is specifically authorised, the arguments can be addressed in the Senate. We can give some more cogent advice which may be sufficient to satisfy the parties which have taken an interest in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to detain the chamber further on this matter save to address one final issue of the amendments that the government intends to move in relation to this bill. I mentioned in the House last night that I had not been given copies of the amendments. In a fuller explanation, I want to advise that I was told when I received a briefing from the department that there may be further amendments of a technical nature and so there was at least that flagging. As with all of these things, I think it is very necessary that, if the opposition is to be able to give timely consideration to further amendments, we need to be given copies of them well before the debate in parliament commences. As I said last night, that did not occur. I have now had an opportunity to review those further amendments; I think they are of a technical nature and, when they are pressed by the government, we will not be opposing them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the provisions of the legislation, which are many in number; some of them are quite complex and others are quite technical. The main provisions relate to: improved access for students to health cards; clarification of the rules relating to the disability support pension and wage supplement; improved arrangements for people transferring benefits between Austudy and the jobsearch or newstart allowances; and an incremental increase in the qualifying age for a seniors health card to 65 years in the year 2014. This of course is making the legislation consistent with the government's changes to age pension arrangements to increase eligibility to 65 years for women by the year 2014.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general objective of the bill is to recognise the significance of education and labour market training in skilling and reskilling people presently in the social security system and provide them with their best opportunity for re-entering the work force. These measures are consistent with the outstanding reform framework being developed by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). In that regard, I think it is useful in this debate to make reference to the minister's discussion paper entitled `Beyond the safety net', which is an attempt to respond to the challenges and pressures now facing the welfare state, not just in Australia but throughout the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue raised in this legislation of the linkage between education and labour market training, to try to provide a seamless social security system where people can move easily from labour market programs to benefits to education to employment, is very important. I think it is an outstanding advance that the minister is pursuing. In many ways, this legislation is underpinned by the philosophical and broader approach the minister is taking through that discussion document, `Beyond the safety net: the future of social security'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in the government eagerly await the reply by the opposition, and its shadow minister, to outline the way in which the opposition would respond to these changes in the welfare state. It is a very interesting debate and it bears relevance to this legislation. The welfare state is under pressure in advanced economies. The fiscal crisis faced by many governments has created tension between aspirations for universality of benefit provision and the need to target and the need to ration public resources to those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been underscored by a political struggle. Politicians, I think, on both sides of this chamber, both sides of politics, search for various mechanisms to establish forms of equality in our society. Those on the right focus their attention on the equality of legal rights whereas those on the left traditionally have focused on an equality of income, wealth and material outcomes. This debate needs to be revised and revisited in our reconsideration of where the welfare state should be headed. </PARA>

If there are those who want to be irrational and pursue irrational policies, that is their problem. However, this is not really a debate set within those frameworks; it is more about political philosophy and ideology. There are some very interesting things happening around the world that are not necessarily related to economic policy. In the United States, for instance, there is Newt Gingrich. I note that the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) is the next speaker on the opposition side. He has a very strong interest in these matters. Gingrich has promoted an argument to say that social choice and social freedom are inconsistent with various forms of social organisation, and of course that is part of the philosophical approach to drive down the size and role of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister interjected and asked about my views on this. Basically, they correspond with the minister's views, as set out in his discussion paper `Beyond the safety net.' What he is trying to do in that document is respond to changes in social circumstances and the way in which we need to reform the welfare state. For instance, unemployment benefits were established after World War II. They were seen as a form of entitlement to allow a short-term transfer between jobs: people would not be unemployed for long periods and the unemployment benefit would see them through from one form of employment to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, through economic restructuring, we now have the incidence of long-term unemployment in Australia that, in turn, has changed the basic assumption on unemployment benefits. Public housing estates after World War II emerged as an attempt to house the blue-collar work force close to manufacturing plants in outer suburbs. Now, through economic restructuring, they have become much closer to welfare housing types because blue-collar jobs are no longer as prevalent in the outer suburbs as they were in the 1950s and 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was assumed that all citizens would enjoy access and benefit from universal service provision in health, education and housing. The emergence of intergenerational unemployment in Australia has challenged that assumption because some communities, some social sectors, are not enjoying the social and economic skills that would be needed to take advantage of the universal services provided by government. Beyond that, the welfare state, partly reflected in this legislation, has had a focus on income support as a basic entitlement, rather than examining means by which capability, skill development, and reskilling of communities in a social and economic sense could proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has argued in his discussion paper that we need to refocus our attention from measures of income support to a definition of poverty and disadvantage closely related to capability in our society&mdash;the capacity and the capability of citizens to pursue social and economic activities, and to enjoy them with a sense of equality and benefit. For instance, on page 36 of the discussion paper, the minister writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Living standards are not just a function of the availability of cash and resources but of having the wherewithal to effectively utilise those resources. Those with the least resources often also have the least capacity to make the most of them.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister draws on the work of the United States political economist Amartya Sen. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sen introduces the term `capability' to refer to the ability to achieve a particular functioning. A person's capability set is the set of functionings that he or she can attain. In effect, the capability set defines the boundaries of what is possible for each person their freedom to achieve. The point of all this is that it provides an underpinning to an approach to poverty, equality and justice that is relevant to countries like ours where starvation and other manifestations of extreme material deprivation are rare. In such societies poverty should be seen essentially as capability failure or loss of substantive freedom, rather than simply the lack or resources.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sen's analysis also has a major bearing on the situation of the unemployed. He refers to a major survey of unemployed people in Belgium which showed that for them the worst thing about unemployment was the loss of freedom to achieve and to make choices to control their own lives rather than reduced income per se.</PARA>
<PARA>This finding from Belgium is a perception that I have picked up in my own electorate when speaking to unemployed people, that their disadvantage in society is not so much a lack of income support, although they often argue the case for better income support; rather their attention is on the loss of capability, the loss of social skills derived from working and the loss of economic and training skills from continually upgrading their position in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the middle way. This is the way in which legislation and government thinking, and I believe opposition thinking, should proceed to redefine our systems of social support from a focus on income to a focus on questions of capability. All of this, and it is reflected in the legislation, closely relates to the challenges we face continually in this country with economic restructuring. The advent of information based work, the pace of capital movements around the world, the growth and integration of the international trading system, with the decline of tariff protection and the emergence of very complex economic systems have led to a higher level of skills being required in the post-industrial economy than would have been seen at any time since the Industrial Revolution. Rewards, and the value of skill, are now being defined very much by the contribution that a worker makes to the international production process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old division we had in this country was primarily between blue- and white-collar work and the assumption that blue-collar work was relatively low skilled, whereas white-collar work required a high level of skills in the labour force. Now, with the exposure of the economy to international trading circumstances, the proper division is between those workers who engage themselves in internationally competitive areas, as part of the international production process, as opposed to workers in non-traded sectors&mdash;be they in agriculture, mining, manufacturing or services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some instances I always relate to in and around my electorate where, when visiting manufacturing plants these days, one is more likely to see white lab coats on the factory floor than blue overalls. This is a nice reflection of the way in which skills are being rewarded in a different fashion from what was experienced in Australia throughout most of the postwar period. There has also been the growth in services employment, with household outsourcing for security, food, laundry, gardening, et cetera. All of this is a very important part of the economic restructuring process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is aware of the agenda and I took it from the interruption from the shadow minister that he is also aware of these philosophical points. I noticed with interest, in listening through various question times in the House, the references both sides of parliament have made to the speech by the US Labor Secretary Robert Reich at the OECD in Paris recently. It is interesting to reflect on his remarks, not so much on the matters that were highlighted at question time but, rather, on some of the substance of his argument about economic restructuring and the role of the welfare state. He said to the OECD:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The philosopher John Rawls had taught us that what we understand to be a fair organisation of society depends to a significant degree on the rules we would choose if we were unaware of our own unique odds of succeeding under them. But today, the Rawlsian veil of ignorance has been lifted. Those who are likely to win already know who they are; they already have, or can easily get, the education, the connections and other resources needed to take full advantage of rapidly changing technologies and global markets. The likely losers, too, know who they are. They lack all these things and, as a practical matter, even if the winners wished to do so&mdash;which is hardly the case&mdash;they could not simply redistribute a portion of their gains to the losers and make any progress in solving the core problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pattern is emerging even in the United States which has the thinnest of safety nets and arguably the most unregulated labor and capital markets of any modern economy. As the economic transformation has accelerated over the last 15 years, the gains of growth have gone almost entirely to the top fifth of earners. They tend to have university degrees and easy entry into the transnational corporations, investment banks, media enterprises, research laboratories and other institutions of the new economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Reich notes further in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a democracy, citizens will vote for economic dynamism only when they feel that they have a fair chance of benefiting from it.</PARA>
<PARA>We have now been joined by the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) and I think this is a point that he tried to make recently, in some quite well-informed articles debating the ideological questions off the US agenda. They are not always well-received by other parts of his party, but it is always interesting, on our side, to know that there is a debate. Some of the time you would have to ring the bell to try to get a debate going across the parliamentary floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting point that citizens will only support economic restructuring and an international trading environment if they feel they have a fair chance of benefiting from it. That is a commonsense statement. But as a logical conclusion from that, they will only have a fair chance if governments have an active role in our society, if governments skill up the community for social and economic capability. This is the point made by the minister and by members such as the member for Sturt. It is in direct contrast to the New Right agenda advanced in the United States by Newt Gingrich and others, which forms an equation where social choice and social freedom are deemed to be incompatible with any form of social organisation, most of all, large and active government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would recommend that, in responding to the minister's agenda and discussion paper and to the things he is trying to achieve out of this legislation, both sides of parliament acknowledge the need for five steps. The first is a shift from income support emphasis, picking up the work of Sen and moving towards a definition of poverty, equality and opportunity based more around capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure is to move away from a compartmentalised approach to government, and to use a whole-of-government approach so that we can case manage the needs of citizens in housing, family support, health, training, employment, and social security benefits, as the need may arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third step is to move from passive to active programs&mdash;to not rely solely on passive programs such as income support, but to take an active role, such as that the government is pioneering with the case management of the needs of the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth step is to move away from the approach which was very well expressed in a recent speech to a CEDA conference in Melbourne by Dr Meredith Edwards, a deputy secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. She said that the public sector has always fallen for the trap of a `one size fits all' approach to benefits and opportunities, and has assumed that all social security benefits will fit the needs of all citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has pointed out&mdash;and it is reflected in the legislation&mdash;we need to customise government support to acknowledge that one size does not always fit all citizens. We need to pick up the particular needs of citizens. Case management is the administrative mechanism which government can use to meet that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth step is to establish a sense of reciprocal responsibilities. The welfare state cannot be just a one-way street, where the government is providing the support but citizens do not accept responsibility for reciprocal efforts and a reciprocal demonstration of cooperation and goodwill with government authorities. That sense of reciprocal responsibilities was well reflected in Working Nation's job compact, where it was acknowledged that, if long-term unemployed people refused a subsidised job or knocked back a training opportunity, they could not expect the government to continue automatically with long-term income support arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these things are up for grabs. Bills like this that are technical and complex&mdash;although perhaps not as wide ranging as other pieces of legislation&mdash;at least provide members with a chance to roam across the philosophical and ideological agenda and to debate these things through. It is an unfortunate aspect of our parliament that, when a minister such the Minister for Social Security takes the time and effort to produce a quite visionary discussion paper&mdash;well researched and well argued&mdash;about the future of the social security system, as parliamentarians we do not always have the opportunity to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reports such as this often sit around the halls of academia or in libraries and, whilst there is nothing wrong with that, parliamentarians should have forums in which to make known their views, not just about things happening in Australia in 1995, but also about things which impact into the medium and longer term. I congratulate the minister on this legislation but, more thoroughly, I congratulate him on the effort he has taken to produce a discussion paper about the future of social security and to prompt members into thinking in the longer term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened carefully to the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). While it was a well-considered speech on the general philosophical issues facing social security policy, it did not actually touch on the specifics of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. While he congratulates the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) for the legislation, I do not think he realises that a lot of the legislation strikes at the very heart of the system of support for the people in our community that he was congratulating the minister for helping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst some of the measures in this bill are particularly necessary, normal and efficient, a number of them will change social security for people and will affect them in a very damaging way. That is what I want to concentrate on in my speech. The Social Security Amendment Bill implements a number of non-budget administrative measures. In doing so, it seeks to alter the legal process, to neuter the arrangements made in settling compensation cases. It sweeps aside the longstanding apportionment of compensation, and seeks to have it treated holus bolus as payment for economic loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government hopes to use schedule 16(b) of this bill to significantly alter the social security treatment of split settlement payments. The coalition is rightly inclined to oppose this move. While the coalition is not opposing most of the legislation, that matter is of particular concern to me. This is not the first time that the government has sought to make changes in this area. The 1993 Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill also attempted to make changes to the compensation provisions of the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the 1993 proposals the government wished to institute a lump sum preclusion period after payment of compensation during which recipients of lump sums eligible for pensions or allowances would not be able to claim entitlements. This period was calculated by dividing the compensation part of their lump sum&mdash;50 per cent of a payment containing an economic component&mdash;by average weekly earnings of all male employees. The government sought to remove the qualification of the compensation payments to which the 50 per cent rule applied by no longer requiring them to have an economic component before the rule became applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under its proposals one half of any lump sum compensation would be treated as an income related payment. This measure was strongly opposed at the time for undermining the integrity of the non-economic component of compensation payments. After much debate and failed negotiations over the amendment it was withdrawn. The new proposals that we are debating here today fail for just the same reason but, to date, they have not been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, if a person receives more than one payment arising out of the same event and part of at least one of these payments is for lost earnings or for lost earning capacity, then the person will be deemed to have received one lump sum to which the 50 per cent rule will apply and it is there that the government and the coalition part company. It is being justified by the Labor Party as a result of a trend to manage compensation payments to avoid compensation recovery provisions of the Social Security Act. The practice is alleged to occur where one settlement for a low amount is made for the loss of earnings and earning capacity and a larger amount, not falling within the definition of compensation and therefore exempt from recovery provisions, is made for non-economic losses such as pain and suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is clear is that these new amendments, while I acknowledge that they are significantly different from the 1993 proposals, will still have a significant impact and great power to reduce the non-economic components of compensation payments. More importantly, they disregard the proper legal process by which such decisions have been arrived at. Sure, there may be one-off poor examples that the government can point to where the allegations are sometimes true. But why should the legal process be circumvented by a government bureaucracy in the vast number of cases where compensation for non-economic loss is quite legitimate? There is no good reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a compensation payment contains a component for pain and suffering, then it is entirely inappropriate and, indeed, unjust for the government to adopt a formula that disregards this and treats it as a payment for economic loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welfare and disabled groups have already commented on how the government's proposals undermine legal settlements. Most importantly, they have pointed out the simple fact that this amendment will make a mockery of the very purpose of settlements for pain and suffering by treating money awarded for non-economic reasons as compensation for loss of income or earnings potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not understand how the government can believe that this measure is in any way compatible with the pieties it sometimes mouths about social justice. Its proposals in this area&mdash;to treat non-economic compensation as economic compensation&mdash;sound like Lewis Carroll politics. They are entirely contradictory and deserve to be opposed. I am surprised that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, would have allowed this to get through the Labor Party caucus knowing the effect that this might have on vast numbers of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the government of a man who sees himself as a visionary. Yet when it comes to people who cannot defend themselves, who are not part of an organised lobby group, the vision of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is cruelly clouded. To Labor, these people are merely statistics that cost too much money. This measure makes a mockery of the ALP's claims to the social justice high ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also applies compensation provisions to claimants as well as recipients. At the moment people are first assessed as to whether they qualify for a compensation affected payment and then compensation recovery provisions are considered. This can lead to individuals being put through a lengthy qualification process, although it is obvious that they will be precluded for payment under the compensation recovery provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under today's bill, compensation recovery provisions may be applied first. Then, after people have effectively exhausted their compensation, an assessment will be made as to whether or not they qualify. This has led to some concern that, if compensation recovery provisions are incorrectly applied, there will be a delay in payment, as qualification has not been established, and that that could lengthen significantly during the appeal process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 also makes amendments to the qualifications for the disability support pension and for the disability wage supplement, schedule 4. Currently, to qualify for the disability support pension people must be able to show that they suffer from an impairment significant enough to prevent them from doing the work they are qualified or skilled for as opposed to work in general. The bill clarifies the meaning of work under the DSP regulations. Under this legislation, it is proposed to change the regulations so that people are unable to claim the DSP if they are fit for any suitable kind of work that they could undertake without training. This amendment has been subject to some criticism, as, in a number of cases, people able to do mundane unskilled work will no longer be eligible for their benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes the bill makes to the 20 per cent impairment regulations may be of greater concern. Under the new provisions, a person will have to have a physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment of 20 per cent or more on the impairment table and a continuing inability to work so as to qualify for the disability support pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welfare rights bodies have warned that this amendment does not adequately consider the situation of people suffering lack of energy or motivation as a result of long-term illness or chronic pain. Welfare rights bodies are concerned that these individuals will be incorrectly excluded from receiving payments.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is also concerned about the effect which this change will have on those who are genuinely unable to work because of the cumulative effect of a disability coupled with a lack of motivation because of long-term illness and chronic pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response, the Department of Social Security has stated that it intends to place low motivation as a direct consequence of illness or impairment on the impairment table as an assessable medical problem, and the coalition supports the action of the department. This is all very well, but the department is not yet willing&mdash;as in all such cases&mdash;to respond to a request to formally confirm that any ambiguity in the interpretation of the amendment will be resolved in favour of the recipient. If the legislation is passed, the department could say, `We didn't put it in writing.' Therefore, there is nothing to rely on if you are a person who will be without the DSP. For this reason, we propose that the changes outlined in schedule 4 be referred to a Senate committee for closer investigation of the effects of the changes. Perhaps the department will then make a commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other changes in the bill are more straightforward. The legislation amends the payment of the jobsearch and newstart allowances and the special benefit payable to people undertaking full-time study. At the moment, the JSA and the NSA payments continue for up to three weeks after a person starts an Austudy approved course of more than six months duration. Under the current proposals, payments will continue for a full three weeks and the requirements of the activity test will be waived during this period. Continuing payments will be extended to courses of less than six months and which are not approved under the terms of the activity test or agreement. Recipients of the special benefit will now receive payment for three weeks after commencing study. JSA, NSA and youth training allowance recipients who commence full-time training courses of less than six months duration will have a $200 education entry payment extended to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill, JSA, NSA or partner allowance recipients who inform the Department of Social Security of changes in their circumstances which affect payment of benefits will have their payments varied, cancelled or suspended effective from the date the change occurs. The dates of changes to payments currently depend on whether the results are favourable or not. This means that changes to benefits that reduce payment amounts will occur earlier than at present as payments will vary when the event occurs rather than once the Department of Social Security makes a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security looks at a notional rate of percentage while taking the lone fringe benefit into consideration when it calculates the effect of parental income on under-18-year-olds in working out family payment rates. Under today's legislation, the interest rate will be set automatically by reference to current market rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also deals with the disadvantaged persons health scheme. Under sections 1171 and 1167 of the Social Security Act, lump sum and periodic payments are not treated as income for the purpose of the Health Insurance Act while other compensation payments are included.

The bill makes amendments to the definition of income to ensure that students who have a loan under the student financial supplement scheme are not precluded from receiving a health care card because of the loan, a measure that should assist 1,800 students.

It brings the qualification for the seniors health card in line with the current pension ages of 65 for men and 60 years and six months for women, once the women's eligibility age rises on 1 July.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) because I think it is important that I represent my community and my seat of Cowan on these issues of social welfare and social security. I also rise to support my colleagues the shadow minister for social security, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and the shadow parliamentary secretary, because I believe they have put our case effectively. In fact, the shadow minister has demonstrated many times in this particular place his compassion for the Australian community, and the ideas that he has put forward today have been well founded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This concept of all for one and one for all has not really been accepted by the Labor Party in its many machinations. I refer not only to the Labor Party itself but also to the derivatives of that, including the ACTU and many of the so-called minority groups that the Labor Party has set up to speak on these sorts of issues. The social welfare issues are problems within our community and I think the community should be addressing them on a better basis than quickly putting ad hoc legislation through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this particular legislation we are advised that there has not been much consultation, and in fact a number of groups have come to us with their concerns about the bill. Some of these include the Welfare Rights Centre in New South Wales, the Welfare Rights Centre in South Australia, the National Federation of Blind Citizens of Australia, the Launceston Community Legal Centre and the South Australian Council of Social Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These groups are showing great concern about the haste of these particular amendments and they have been very quick to tell us so. That is a sad story about some of the legislation that the Labor Party puts through on these social issues, which are a vitally important aspect of the community today. I guess that social security legislation needs changing to keep up with the times and therefore it could need adjusting, but as a new member of parliament&mdash;and I have been a member now for more than two years&mdash;I am amazed by the number of times we have to alter social security and social services legislation and the number of times I have actually spoken on amendments in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments really confirm the myth that the Labor Party and its fellow travellers try to perpetuate on an ongoing basis&mdash;that is, that they represent the only party, the true ruling party, and that they are the only ones who have a caring and sharing attitude towards the Australian people. I do not think that, at this time in the Australian community, that is quite acceptable, because there are a lot of people out there in the community who are hurting at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that, when the Labor Party was in opposition many years ago, it actually listened to the community and responded to what it needed. But now it seems that the Labor Party has its own idea of a social agenda and is not prepared to listen any more to the community. There is no consideration for the real issues and there is no consideration given to the people who are really aching to be heard out there in the community. The Australian Labor Party continually projects itself as the natural party of social issues but, as you no doubt realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, the reality is very different from the rhetoric and what the perceptions are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow minister pointed out, we have problems with some parts of this legislation&mdash;the amendments which have been the subject of great concern by those who actually work out in the field of social services. They are concerns the Labor government has failed to hear, and that continues the trend of the arrogant nature of this particular government. It is virtually telling people in the Australian community what is good for them rather than listening to what they really need. This autocratic management style that the Labor Party projects is very much a sixties style of management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You never behave when I speak, Parliamentary Secretary, so I am getting used to it. But it is a bit of a paradox, because here is the Labor government ridiculing anyone who talks about community values and community customs of the sixties. People in the Labor government ridicule anyone who wants to maintain those values and those customs, but here they are using a sixties style of management in a very autocratic sense. Any manager at the moment would say that autocratic management is a thing of the past and that it is really a dinosaur attitude. But here they are showing again, with legislation they have brought forward, that they really have not listened to certain groups that are actually out in the field in the community. I guess the community will be a bit saddened and will probably make the decision at the next election in favour of those who will listen to what they have to say. One of the failures in leadership has been the process, as with these amendments, and it appears that the government again has not really listened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see where we have some concern within this particular field. The bill seeks to amend the definition of the meaning of work in relation to the disability support pension. Currently, people must show that their impairment is sufficient to prevent them from doing work for which they are currently skilled rather than doing other work. The amendment provides that people may not qualify if they are fit for any work&mdash;that is, work that is skilled or unskilled that they could do without education or any training. On the surface, this sounds simple enough, but we have to look beyond that as to whether or not it will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My guess is that the government's intent is that, because disabled people are recipients of a pension, unless they are able to complete any type of job they will be faced with entering the employment market. So if they are disabled at the moment and they can, in fact, do any other job, they will be forced&mdash;I do not like using the word `forced'&mdash;or requested or will need to move into the employment market. This may be fine in theory but, as we parliamentarians know and realise, the community is full of unusual situations that fellow Australians find themselves in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this amendment could mean is that people will move off the disability pension. They may be subjected to a mundane type of job which is not stimulating in terms of their mental skills&mdash;it could mean that. It could mean that, if they have to nominate themselves for work, they might fall back onto the unemployment figures. In looking at the long-term requirements regarding unemployment, they would have to move into an employment contract or some sort of compact or case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Labor policy at the moment is to drop people off these particular statistics. A possible scenario could involve someone with a disability&mdash;maybe the person has an arm missing. If it involves the right hand, even though the person has always favoured the right hand, he or she can in fact do other duties and could, I guess, be forced back into employment which is not stimulating. These people might have an MBA or some sort of other higher degree, but they could find themselves back in long-term unemployment where they are forced to go through some training programs. I have a letter from a training provider to one of my constituents that states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are no doubt aware, the offer of a position on a new work opportunities program is considered an offer of suitable employment. Failure to attend the start of the program will result in your unemployment benefits being withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA>This particular person was asked to go into a program which was called an aquatic care program, which meant six months out in the sun. He suffers with skin cancer, so it was being demanded that he go along to a training program which was not suitable for health reasons. It is an extreme scenario; but we can have these people, disabled through no fault of their own, being placed in a situation of unemployment and case management and being forced through that whole process. Can anyone in the government say without any doubt, with extreme confidence, that these sorts of scenarios could not or would not happen? The point that I am putting is that they cannot definitely say that it will not happen; so I have a concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the amendment concerning the 20 per cent impairment requirement for physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment. The easy response for this amendment is, `Yes, let's agree to it.' Certainly there are people in the community who are looking for this sort of amendment, to allow for people who may not be motivated or who may lack the energy for employment being excluded from getting any sort of disablement payment. The 20 per cent may cover a few people and force them back into the employment structure. Probably an easy answer is, `Yes, we should do that.' But we should be considering those who really are not motivated, who do lack the energy, or who do have some sort of psychiatric problem. Let us face it: mental illness is a problem within the community. Perhaps this 20 per cent provision may be unreasonable; but then again, perhaps it is reasonable. The vital point here is that we should be listening to those in the field who deal with these sorts of scenarios. Perhaps we should be listening to them more than we have in developing this particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps putting it to a Senate committee will mean that those people who are in the community&mdash;in the field&mdash;will have the opportunity to put their case. Maybe their case is not strong enough, and maybe we should go forward with this 20 per cent impairment amendment; but the point is that they should be able to put their case forward. Why we have to go to a Senate committee is beyond me, but because of the autocratic nature of the government it has not been one to listen to people. But here we are, forcing government senators into a Senate committee to become good listeners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is timely to remind the Committee of some of the facts about the government when it comes to social security. I am pleased to hear that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) is such a good listener. People in the government are a bit out of touch when it comes to a lot of the things that are happening in the community at the moment. The accusation of not listening is quite correct, in my view. Perhaps they would like to listen to some of the facts about some of the things that are happening in the community at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to remind the government that, after 12 years of Labor government, one in 10 families have both parents out of work. Almost 19 per cent of Australia's children under 15 live in a family with no breadwinner. One-quarter of Australian families has no working member; that is about 1.15 million families that have no working member. The number of traditional families falling into the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. The number of children who are members of families dependent on social security payments rose from approximately 620,000 in 1982 to approximately 1.6 million in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One in eight families are falling below the poverty line. Poverty is increasing in almost every group except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line, which equates to 13 per cent of households: a rise of over 14 per cent since 1983. Of all Australians living in poverty, just one-half come from traditional nuclear families, while 44 per cent of Australia's single parent families live in poverty. Taking inflation into account, the top 10 per cent of earners have seen their incomes rise by approximately seven per cent since Labor took office. Over the same period, real wages for the bottom 10 per cent have fallen by five per cent. The top 20 per cent of income earners get 42.1 per cent of the total earnings; the bottom 20 per cent get 5.4 per cent of the total earnings. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these facts because too often we are fed a myth about the Labor Party. These amendments are another example of the government bringing forward a bill without proper consultation with the community or with those who work in the field. It is another bill that it has tried to put through without the consequences being adequately considered; another bill that requires further consideration with the Senate; another bill that tries to extend the myth of the Labor Party being the sharing and caring party when in fact we dispute that; another bill that exposes the weaknesses of Labor management when it comes to this place. At the moment, there are 80-odd bills in the Senate waiting to be debated. The government cannot get its act together in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian community wants more than the rhetoric of the Labor Party and its fellow travellers. It wants more than the Labor policy of throwing money at a problem. It is always throwing money at a problem rather than getting into the basic core of what is causing the problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it a fact that the Los Angeles International, New York La Guardia, Chicago O'Hare International and Boston-Logan International airports routinely conduct operations involving crossing of active runways by taxiing, arriving and departing aircraft; if so, can such operations be introduced at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport; if not, why not.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr Brereton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that whilst it is a fact that at Los Angeles International, New York La Guardia International, Chicago O'Hare International and Boston-Logan International Airports conduct operations involving crossing of active runways by taxiing, arriving and departing aircraft, not all of these operations occur at all airports. For example, Los Angeles Airport has four parallel runways and does not have intersecting runway operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the commencement of operations on the parallel runway at Sydney, operations were routinely conducted involving Simultaneous Operations on intersecting runways (SIMOPS). The application of SIMOPS was consistent with international practice and was used to overcome a capacity deficiency at the airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The availability of the parallel runway has enabled a much safer operation, ie parallel in lieu of SIMOPS, while at the same time delivering a more predictable and stable airport capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA has advised that on safety grounds it does not recommend the use of the east-west runway while the parallel north-south runway system is in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a media release on 30 November 1994, the Civil Aviation Authority stated that, on safety grounds, it strongly advises against the use of the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This position was based on the following considerations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been accepted internationally that parallel runway operations are an improvement in safety over intersecting operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More complex three runway configuration operations would increase workload and complexity for air traffic controllers and pilots, with conflicting traffic patterns both on the ground and in the air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of aircraft would need to cross the active east-west runway to position for take-off on the parallel runways, or taxiing to the terminals after landing. It is estimated that aircraft would be expected to cross the east-west runway every 45 seconds or less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the use of the intersecting east-west runway, the required safety corridors to accommodate aircraft carrying out missed approaches could not be readily provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of parallel runway operations the higher average movement rate and the elimination of the very low bad weather movement rates have already proven beneficial to the industry since operations commenced on the parallel system. The parallel runway configuration, when used to its full capacity, will have a consistently higher movement rate than that attainable using SIMOPS and therefore is the preferred safer mode of operation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr Gear</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Information regarding child support payers and payees is stored by the Child Support Agency computer system against the postcode of the client and not by electoral division. Consequently, there are some difficulties in answering this question as postcodes do not correspond exactly with electoral boundaries and many postcodes will relate to more than one electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the above proviso, the information the Agency can provide in response to this question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>                Payees  Payers</PARA>
<PARA>Fisher            3090    2753</PARA>
<PARA>Longman           3362    2707</PARA>
<PARA>Common Postcodes  1947    1818</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Child Support Agency does not keep statistics of complaints received by Electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Child Support Agency does not keep national statistics on all types of complaints which may be made to an Agency Branch Office. However, since the 1992/93 financial year the Agency has kept a record of written enquiries and complaints and other letters of comment directed to the Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer or the Agency Executive (e.g. Registrar, Second Commissioner Child Support).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This correspondence is analysed by the Agency to determine the areas of concern to correspondents and classified according to a range of identified problem areas. The results of the analysis for 1992/93, 1993/94 and 1994/95 (to March 1995) show the most common areas of concern to be in the failure to collect child support arrears by the Agency, accounting for 12%, 14.3% and 17.2% respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) By way of providing some background to this question it is important to note that statements can be issued either automatically by the child support computer system or upon request from the client.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Automatic Statements issue on a monthly or weekly basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Monthly statements</EMPHASIS> issue on or around 20th of the month and advise clients of their account position. They also advise clients of the amount to be paid next month and thereby serve a dual purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly statements </EMPHASIS>issue when a transaction occurs that affects the client's account (for example a variation to the child support liability). This ensures that the client is advised of any adjustment to their account and the new amount payable. These statements are produced at the end of the week and incorporate all transactions that occurred during the week showing a net result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon Request Statements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A facility also exists where statements can be produced at any time. This allows for a statement to be issued whenever a client may request one. A statement can list all transactions for whatever period the client requires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Receipt of Contradictory Statements</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the computer system has been designed to avoid the issuing of contradictory statements on successive days, it is possible but highly unlikely for it to occur. However, as both weekly and monthly statements are produced at the end of the week, it is highly improbable that they would be issued on successive days. It may be possible that </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">they are received on successive days if postal delays occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issuing of a statement following the request of a client is more likely to cause the receipt of statements on successive days. This could occur when an Agency officer requests a statement without consideration of  when the last `automatic' statement issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agency does receive complaints regarding the issuing of statements. The actual nature of these complaints varies case by case and the Agency does not maintain national statistics on the nature of these complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The qualifications regarding postcode outlined in response to question 1 are also relevant here.
