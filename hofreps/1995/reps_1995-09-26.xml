<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the bill is to strengthen the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Honourable members will recognise the importance of balancing the interests of noise affected communities against the operational requirements of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The night hours are the most sensitive hours for noise around the airport. Communities affected by aircraft noise during the day deserve to be free of this disturbance during the night. The government is therefore committed to minimising, to the greatest extent possible, the activities at the airport during the night-time curfew period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already made significant improvements to the curfew regime over the past year. Last December, the government introduced a monetary penalty of up to $25,000 for curfew breaches. This replaced the previous arrangements where curfew breaches were dealt with administratively rather than by the courts and without provision for monetary penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last April the government introduced stricter limitations on movements by larger freight jets. Approvals for the operation of Boeing 737 and Airbus A300 freight aircraft have either lapsed or been withdrawn. Moreover, operations by McDonnell Douglas DC9 aircraft are being phased out and must be eliminated by May 1996. Permitted jet movements will then be restricted to the quieter British Aerospace Bae146 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strict approach has also been adopted in considering requests for dispensations from the curfew at Sydney airport. In the first six months of 1995, an average of 3 dispensations a month have been granted, compared with an average of approximately 25 curfew dispensations per month during 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulations have been made to ensure that all night-time jet freight operations into Sydney airport are banned after the opening of Sydney West airport. The people of western Sydney can be reassured that the government's comprehensive updating of the environmental impact statement for the new airport will have as its central objective the prevention of noise nuisance arising from night-time operations. It is fundamentally important that we learn the lessons of Sydney airport and ensure that future generations of western suburbs residents are not exposed to excessive noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private member's bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in the last sittings, by proposing only to replicate the current curfew regulations in legislation, did nothing to ease the burden of the airport's operations at night on the residents of Sydney. After so strongly supporting the parallel runway development at Sydney airport, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) now seeks to deceive voters into thinking he will do something about the curfew. In reality he would do nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the request of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), the Howard private member's bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure with a view to strengthening the current curfew arrangements. Residents affected by aircraft noise in Sydney are fortunate to have an elected representative such as Mary Easson who recognised the need to strengthen the curfew and at whose instigation the committee was tasked to look at this issue. The measures in this bill are the direct result of her efforts on behalf of residents living around Sydney airport</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful to Peter Morris and his committee for carrying out this inquiry and reporting in such a tight time frame. The proposals put forward by the committee comprise a significant package and have been of considerable assistance in the preparation of the bill now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, in building on the current stricter curfew arrangements, goes much further to provide a range of new initiatives to strengthen and enhance the current controls. For this reason the government has decided to draft a new bill, rather than propose numerous amendments to the bill introduced by the Leader of the Opposition. The government's bill is aimed at minimising curfew aircraft operations at Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to respond to the committee's proposals.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their first two proposals the committee suggested steps to reduce the number of international passenger aircraft movements during the first and last hours of the curfew. The government accepts the absolute desirability of reducing the number of these movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the committee's recommendations, the international entitlements in the bill reflect current usage patterns. This means an immediate reduction in the current international passenger jet entitlements between the hours of 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. from 42 movements per week, with no more than eight on any day, to a maximum of 35 movements per week, with no more than seven on any day. The bill also enables regulations to prescribe lower levels of entitlements. In line with the committee's proposal for a progressive phase-out, I envisage reducing entitlements whenever practicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the bill introduces a regime requiring each individual international passenger movement during the curfew shoulder periods to be fully justified. International passenger movements during the shoulder periods will not be permitted once Sydney West airport is capable of handling those movements. In the interim, international passenger movements will only be approved if they can be justified by reason of curfew constraints at overseas airports or lack of available capacity at Sydney airport outside the curfew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill establishes a process where operators of international passenger aircraft may apply to the Secretary of the Department of Transport for approval for specific flights. This will require the department and the industry to, for the first time, assess carefully the feasibility of rescheduling these shoulder hour flights into non-curfew times. This process is consistent with the committee's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the public have complained about aircraft departing to the north of the airport just on 11 p.m. and therefore not clearing the suburbs until some time after the start of the curfew. In order to address this issue the bill contains a provision which requires all aircraft to depart over the bay after 10.45 p.m. If wind conditions preclude these take-offs the aircraft will not be permitted to depart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current arrangements allow an aircraft that has received a clearance to push back from a gate before 11 p.m. to depart during the curfew provided it takes off over Botany Bay. Certain operators have taken advantage of this provision and have been seeking, and receiving, push back clearances well before they are actually ready to depart. This has allowed some aircraft to depart from the airport well after 11 p.m. without breaching the regulations. In line with the committee's proposal this push back provision has been abolished. The bill before the House contains a provision based on taxi clearance, which means that aircraft will have to be actually available for take-off before 11 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated earlier curfew movements by the larger jet freight aircraft have been, or are being, phased out. In order to ensure that the gains from this initiative are not circumvented by the use of larger and relatively noisy propeller-driven aircraft, the bill contains a provision which prohibits the use of propeller-driven aircraft which have a maximum take-off weight greater than 34,000 kilograms. This seeks to address the concerns expressed by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been considerable public disquiet about the issuing of curfew dispensations and the committee made a number of proposals in this area. In future, guidelines will be used in assessing applications for curfew dispensations. The preparation of these guidelines will be subject to a public consultation process. It is envisaged that, subject to this process, the guidelines will restrict any such operations to fly only over Botany Bay. However, there will be provision for dispensations to be granted for operations on other runways in the event of a force majeur situation arising; for instance, a civil emergency. There would be an exemption in those very special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a dispensation is granted, the bill requires the minister to table a statement outlining the reasons for the dispensation in each house of the parliament within five sitting days. The Morris committee suggested that the minister be given authority to increase the number of flights during the curfew for one-off events such as the 2000 Olympics. The government intends to ensure that Sydney airport and Sydney West airport, which will then be open, are capable of handling the level of air traffic during the Olympic period without the need to relax the curfew at Sydney airport. This proposal is therefore not accepted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present curfew regulations the maximum fine for a breach of the curfew is $25,000 for a corporation. This is consistent with the Commonwealth criminal law policy that penalties in regulations are intended for minor offences only. By placing the curfew controls in this act, the penalties can be increased to be consistent with those imposed for similar offences under other legislation. The government therefore supports the committee's proposal that the bill provide for penalties of up to $20,000 for individuals and $100,000 for corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to improving the processes for community consultation on curfew issues. This is already demonstrated through the establishment of the Sydney airport community consultative committee chaired by the Hon. Joe Riordan. The Morris committee has proposed that this be further pursued through a general purpose standing committee of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill incorporates the consultation procedures currently before the parliament in the Legislative Instruments Bill. They will allow public scrutiny of any proposals to amend this bill once enacted. They will also apply to the development of instruments under this legislation. Adoption of these consultation procedures will not of course preclude any curfew issues being dealt with by a committee of the House when considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of residents being woken up early on weekend mornings by a succession of landings from the north starting at 6 a.m. has been a particular problem. The committee proposed that the feasibility of restricting operations over Botany Bay between the hours of 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. at weekends be examined. The bill adopts this proposal to give much needed relief in this area, whenever safe operations can be conducted over Botany Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On occasions aircraft approach the airport from the south at night but `miss the approach' and have to abort their landings. Although this is an internationally accepted procedure and is essential to safe flying, it results in the aircraft flying over the suburbs to the north and creating significant noise disturbance. In order to explain to the community the reason for these events the committee proposed that operators place an explanatory advertisement in local newspapers within seven days of such an event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal has not been taken up in full due to advice of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority which considers that a statutory requirement for airlines themselves to give a public account for carrying out a missed approach may have an adverse effect on flight safety. However, consistent with the longstanding requirement for the reporting of the use of reverse thrust, the bill contains a requirement for an explanatory report to be provided to the Secretary to the Department of Transport when a missed approach occurs. This information will be made public through the Sydney airport community consultative committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Morris committee noted that noise disturbance at night is not restricted to aircraft operating out of Sydney airport and that a study should be undertaken of the impacts of propeller-driven aircraft carrying out night-time operations around Sydney. The government accepts this. The proposed study will be carried out immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a first step to offset the noise impacts of propeller-driven aircraft operating into and out of Sydney airport at night, I propose to amend the Air Navigation (Aerodrome Flight Corridors) Regulations so that propeller-driven aircraft will be required to adhere to flight corridors over the Kurnell sandhills when landing or taking off during the curfew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final matter raised by the committee was that the noise complaint handling procedures at Sydney airport be reviewed. I am now taking steps to ensure that this is done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With his ineffectual private member's bill having been gazumped by our curfew bill, I am aware that the Leader of the Opposition has foreshadowed a new stunt in the form of an amendment to `reopen' the east-west runway. Leaving aside the outrageous cynicism and cowardly deception displayed by the Leader of the Opposition in attempting to back away from his strident advocacy of the third runway, nothing could be more detrimental to the interests of those in the flight paths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All our technical advice has been in favour of parallel runway operations, just as it would be if the Leader of Opposition were in office. If he ignored such advice from all the relevant agencies and outside experts, he would be directly and singularly responsible for running the airport in a manner that was less safe and a long way short of capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality his notion of reopening the east-west runway is the airlines' proposal to use the eastern end of the runway for stub operations by propeller aircraft. Sure, this would overcome some of the safety and capacity problems&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;but it would also free up the north-south axis for more jet movements, because it would eliminate those 10 propeller movements on the north-south axis at the moment. Indeed, the movement rate to the north would not be 80 to 85 overall movements per hour; it would be 80 to 85 jet movements per hour down that corridor, an increase of at least 10 jets per hour to the north&mdash;10 more jumbos thundering down that corridor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airlines would certainly be delighted because they could go on deferring any need to use Badgerys Creek and, therefore, any need to duplicate facilities. But the already suffering residents on the north-south flight path would face a huge increase in their noise burden, all thanks to the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps this is the reason he supported the third runway in 1989. Back then he was absolutely derisory about the issue of aircraft noise. Today, just as he tries to deceive people into believing he cares about the low paid, he is trying to say that he cares about noise affected residents. Well, the government will not let him get away with it. At every turn we will remind the electorate of everything he has previously said, and at the same time we will continue our own drive to provide genuine protection for the noise affected residents under the flight paths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that the new measures introduced by the bill will significantly enhance the current curfew arrangements and will therefore bring much needed relief to residents living around Sydney airport. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the first thing that should be said about the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill 1995 is that we would never have had a government bill had it not been for my private member's bill. The message that should go out to all of the people that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) now claims to be concerned about is that the government has had 12 1/2 years to entrench the curfew into legislation but it took my private member's bill to get them off their tails to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, do not come in here posing as the new-found friend of the noise afflicted people under the north-south flight path. As will be demonstrated as this debate unfolds, all of your actions, conspiring at all stages with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in relation to this matter, have been designed to protect the people you represent&mdash;your political interests&mdash;and to hell with the concerns and the interests of people in other parts of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you have done throughout the conduct of this whole airport matter is to dump all of the pain and suffering of additional aircraft noise onto a narrow number of people. You have adopted the principle: we will make a small number suffer 24 hours a day so that we will minimise the spread of people who are affected. All of your cynical conduct will be demonstrated in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1989, one of the ideas was to keep the east-west runway open. It was the intervention of the Prime Minister, conspiring with you, that stopped that occurring. The consequence of that is that many people in my electorate and many people in the electorate of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) are now paying very dearly. But the last thing that you can do, or anybody on your side can do, is to pretend that in some way you are concerned to entrench the curfew into law. I remind you that you had 12 1/2 years to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I introduced a private member's bill a couple of months ago. That private member's bill got you on the hop. As a consequence, you decided to send it off to the Morris committee. You added a few things in about the shoulder flights, and I have no objection to those. But the core situation is that, had it not been for the Howard private member's bill, the curfew would never have been entrenched into law. It has taken us, from opposition, through the device of a private member's bill, to get you to do something about this particular issue. That is the first thing that has to be said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's behaviour in respect of Sydney airport has been characterised over the past few years by playing a blatant political game. It is a game designed not to spread the burden around, which is the fair way, the Australian way of doing something. Nobody likes living under a flight path. Nobody likes excessive airport noise. It has always seemed to me and to many others on this side of the House&mdash;and I am sure to many on the opposite side of the House&mdash;that the fair and decent Australian thing to do when you have a problem is to spread it around so that there is a fair and equal sharing of the burden. I am not asking that there be no noise at all over the north-south flight path. I am not asking that all of the noise go out over the minister's electorate; I am just asking that a little of it does. I am asking that there be a fair sharing of the burden. I am asking him to relieve the people who live in areas such as Hunters Hill, Drummoyne, Haberfield, Marrickville and Leichhardt from all of the noise burden and to take some of it himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not the case with the typical winner takes all approach of the Labor Party. You are in power, you have the capacity to make the decisions, so you free your constituents completely from the noise and say that Howard's constituents and Easson's constituents can cop all of the noise. I do not think Easson's constituents will go on copping all of the noise. I think at the next election Easson's constituents are going to do something about her and something about you in the process. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all about spreading the noise burden around. I am not asking that the people who live in the Kingsford-Smith area and the people who live in Rockdale and Kogarah have all of the noise, but the minister is asking that people who live in Drummoyne and Hunters Hill have all of the noise. The difference between Brereton and Howard is that Howard wants a fair sharing of the burden; Brereton wants to dump it on somebody other than his own mates. It is as simple as that. It is a typical Brereton principle. It is the way you lot behave; the way you lot operate. If you can get away with it, you will. To hell with any principle and to the devil with any sorts of consequences. There are many people who are awake up to that. As this debate unfolds, there will be other material produced which will demonstrate very conclusively that this whole handling back in 1989 was all designed and conceived in a blatant political fashion. The original intention was that the east-west runway would remain open. The decision for purely political reasons was made to stop that occurring. That will be developed very effectively by the shadow member for transport, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take the opportunity, because this debate allows me to do so, to emphasise again the alternative policy approach of the coalition to this issue. The coalition remains very strongly committed to the fair sharing of the noise burden. As a consequence, the coalition remains very strongly committed to the reopening of the east-west runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. That is the cornerstone of the different approach that we take. I am arranging to have circulated an amendment to this bill. This amendment will provide those sitting opposite, and particularly the member for Lowe, with an ideal opportunity to stand up for their constituents. If the member for Lowe is really concerned about the people who live under the flight path in suburbs like Drummoyne and Haberfield, she will vote for my amendment to reopen the east-west runway&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reopening the east-west runway remains the cornerstone of the policy of the opposition. I make it clear that our commitment to reopen the east-west runway has nothing at all to do with the policy advanced by the airlines, as falsely and dishonestly alleged by the minister, so much so that I can inform the House that, before the joint statement was issued by Qantas and Ansett, Mr McMahon, the Managing Director of Ansett, rang me to receive my, if you like, confirmation of the coalition's policy in relation to the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McMahon said to me, `Well, we don't agree with what you're proposing in relation to the east-west runway. I suppose we're going to have an argument about it.' I said, `I'm afraid, Graeme, that we are going to have an argument because I do not think what the airlines are doing is in the interests of the people of Sydney who are under the flight paths.' I make no bones about the fact that I do not think either of the airlines is acting out of a proper regard for the interests of the people who are badly affected by noise levels in Sydney at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that the nonsense peddled by the minister about my proposal being the airline proposal is utterly wrong again. My proposal is the full reopening of the east-west runway. That will result in a dramatic reduction in noise over the people under the north-south flight path. It will result in the noise being spread around. It will mean that some people living in the minister's electorate will again have some noise, but at least it will be fairly spread around. That is the cornerstone of the coalition's approach to this issue. The minister's approach is that, if you can get away with dumping all of the noise on a limited number of people, that is the political approach that you ought to adopt. That is what he has done. The government have battened down the hatches and they are going to run this phoney argument about safety, which I want to say something about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to August 1991, when Senator Collins was the minister responsible for aviation matters. He was asked a question about an incident at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport involving a Thai International aircraft and an Ansett domestic flight. This is what the minister, Senator Collins, had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does the serious examination of these very serious incidents no justice to simply hang these tags on them. The facts are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>listen very carefully to this, Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that simultaneous operations are in operation at many, many major airports around the world. There is absolutely no reason whatever why simultaneous operations, if conducted efficiently and professionally, cannot be used&mdash;as they are used in Adelaide, as well as Sydney&mdash;with perfect safety.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat the words `with perfect safety'. They were not John Howard's words. They were not the words of my constituents. They were the words of your colleague Senator Collins, who knew darn well that what he was saying was absolutely correct. Perhaps the minister can give us the benefit of all this professional advice he has on the subject and explain to me why it is that almost a score of airports around the world have crisscrossing runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport shakes his head. Are you suggesting that we do not have intersecting runways at San Francisco? Are you suggesting we do not have them at Heathrow? Are you suggesting that we do not have them at La Guardia? Are you suggesting that we do not have them at Los Angeles International? We all know you travel a lot, Laurie. You are no slacker when it comes to overseas travel. You get your fair share. I am not having a go at you, but the last person who can be an innocent abroad when it comes to international airports is Laurie Brereton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Laurie shakes his head and says that there are not intersecting runways at Heathrow, Los Angeles or La Guardia, everybody knows that he is talking nonsense. He knows that this safety argument is an absolute furphy in this issue. With the exception of very few witnesses, the great bulk of the evidence given before the Senate inquiry indicates that they could be operated with perfect safety. </PARA>

For 12 1/2 years they have sat in government and had the opportunity to protect people, but now the minister comes into the House in his parsimonious way and says, `We are protecting the people of these suburbs from the noise.' You had 12 1/2 years to do something about that and you did nothing about it. It was only when I caught you on the hop with my private member's bill&mdash;I put you over a barrel with my private member's bill&mdash;that you decided you had to come back and claim that you gazumped me. </PARA>

He had 12 1/2 years to pre-empt me, and now he is claiming he has gazumped me. That is the most extraordinary exercise in logic, even from you, that I have heard for a very long time. The first point I make is that this legislation would never have seen the light of day had it not been for the Howard private member's bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make is that we remain utterly and completely committed to the reopening of the east-west runway. We rely very heavily on the expert evidence that has been given before the Senate committee to utterly refute the argument about safety which was falsely, maliciously and fraudulently advanced by the minister. I remind him of what his predecessor, Senator Collins, said in 1991. He said that simultaneous operations could be conducted with absolute safety. I remind him of the experience, which he no doubt has witnessed, of simultaneous intersecting operations at airports overseas as further evidence that the safety claim you advance is completely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally reject the claim made by the minister that my proposal in relation to the east-west runway is the airlines' proposal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I confirm again that the opposition supports privatisation in principle. In fact, we have been light years ahead of the government in abdicating privatisation. If there is one group in this parliament who cannot talk about good faith, who cannot raise allegations of fraud when it comes to privatisation, it is members of the Australian Labor Party. Who will ever forget those speeches that were made in the 1980s by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating about how privatisation was like burning down the gum tree, that Ben Chifley would literally spin in his grave if he thought great national assets were to be sold. `While ever I have breath in my body,' said the former Prime Minister, `I will fight to the end the privatisation of these great Australian institutions.' That was the cant and the humbug that emanated from the mouths of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did they do? In the dead of night, when they thought nobody was looking, when it was too late to call the caucus together and they desperately needed the dough, what did they do? They said, `We think we'll privatise the Commonwealth Bank.' If the provisions of the Companies Act applied to Ralph Willis, he would be in the slammer now for what he said in relation to the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. He misled, he deceived, he induced people to invest in shares in that company on the basis of continued public ownership, and you have the nerve and the gall to walk into this House and start talking to me and to anybody on this side of the House, who have maintained an honourable, consistent policy on privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not said that every asset owned by the government ought to be privatised. We have said that where there is a public interest privatisation ought to proceed. It is clearly not in the public interest to proceed with the privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport until this noise issue has been resolved because the people affected will feel that they have lost control. You know that, and everybody on this side of the House and on that side of the House knows exactly the same thing. </PARA>

If the government is prepared to come to the party on that issue our position will change, but I do not think they will. They are locked into a political strategy on this. It is a political strategy of punishment and discrimination against people who do not meet the political convenience of the minister. It is typical of his style. It is typical of the style of his government. It is that style and that approach that we totally reject and we will go on rejecting.

What was the purpose of the bill that was brought in by the Leader of the Opposition after his newfound interest in aircraft noise? It was simply to enshrine into an act what already existed in regulation. Those regulations were drawn under the power provided in the Air Navigation Act. One could say that it really was a stunt, and thinking people know that it was a stunt. It was a stunt so he could be seen to be doing something for the people upon whom he had sought to inflict noise and disturbance for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition does not have any credentials on this issue. He said that after 12 1/2 years the minister has just discovered there is a problem with the curfew. Living near the airport, the minister has known that fact for a bit longer than 12 1/2 years. He is well experienced in aircraft noise. He well understands the impact. Really, the Leader of the Opposition has taken 21 years to discover what he accuses the minister of having taken 12 1/2 years to discover&mdash;that is, aircraft noise is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition was helping to lead the charge for the third runway, he well knew what the impact would be, and we listened to his rather cursory remarks about the reopening of the east-west runway. The east-west runway can be and is used in conditions when the crosswinds are such that it is unsafe to use the north-south runways. The Leader of the Opposition made reference to several airports abroad that do use cross-runways in association with parallel runways. Amongst others, he referred to the airports of Los Angeles, Heathrow and Chicago's O'Hare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us just put the facts on the table&mdash;not the cursory comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in what was really a furphy about the use of the east-west runway. Los Angeles airport has four parallel runways; it does not have intersecting runway operations. Heathrow, which is the busiest airport in the world in terms of international aircraft movements, has two parallel runways and a crosswind runway; but, as a general rule, the crosswind runway is not used unless the crosswind exceeds 20 knots. Over the period of 1984 to 1990, usage of the crosswind runway at Heathrow, as quoted by the Leader of the Opposition, averaged 1.4 per cent of total aircraft movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Leader of the Opposition indicating for the use of the east-west runway at Mascot a 1.4 per cent use? Of course he is not. He wants to go back to the bad old days when he did not care about aircraft noise because it did not come anywhere near to Bennelong and his constituents. But the situation at Heathrow is somewhat similar to the situation at Sydney airport in that operations are generally confined to the parallel runway system which offers the greatest capacity, and the crosswind runway is only used when the crosswinds in the parallel system exceed a prescribed limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of heavily trafficked airports in the United States and Europe that have intersecting runway operations, including Chicago's O'Hare. But in a number of cases intersecting runway operations are necessary to cater for the large number of aircraft movements at these airports. Sydney is battling at around 225,000 movements per annum. Chicago's O'Hare airport had 841,000 aircraft movements in 1992. This compares to aircraft movements currently at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport of 225,000&mdash;and it can go up to 253,000. Is there a message in this? Is the Leader of the Opposition really saying that you can maximise further still the use of the Sydney Mascot system by bringing in the parallel runways and maximising the use of a crosswind runway so that the use of Mascot might be considerably even greater still, running along the lines of what is happening at Chicago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been several incidents at various US airports, including Chicago's O'Hare airport, related to simultaneous operations on intersecting runways&mdash;and even at Kingsford Smith, at Mascot. The Bureau of Air Safety has advised that there were a total of 11 incidents relating to simultaneous operations over the five years up to the end of 1994 when parallel runways became the preferred mode of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it in perspective, what the Leader of the Opposition has sought to do has been to present a false picture about the use of a crosswind runway, about the use of the east-west runway, at Mascot. He has tried somehow to muddy this altogether and say, `Well, if it's good enough to be done at Chicago's O'Hare airport or elsewhere in the United States, it ought to be good enough to be done in Australia.' I do not give any credence to the case mounted by the Leader of the Opposition. I have known him too long, I have heard him too often and I have been the butt too often of their criticism for being opposed to a third runway at Sydney airport. But they ran with it; they persuaded enough people on the third runway to ultimately lead to its being built. Now, having led the charge in that, they have to accept some responsibility for it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal quickly with the parts of the report that address the issues involved. Airports are nimbys&mdash;everybody wants one but in somebody else's backyard. Everybody wants to utilise the services that an airport provides but they do not want to be affected by the noise and the disturbances that come from airports. The committee dealt with the issue of shoulder periods&mdash;that is, the period from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. when up to 42 international flights a week are permitted to come in and between 11 p.m. and midnight when 14 flights a week are permitted to go out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to press upon the House that those arrangements resulted from a policy understanding that there was not to be a third runway; they were a trade-off. At the time there was no third runway at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, and taking into account the fact that the arrival and departure of international aircraft are of such importance to the economy and to the overall scheduling arrangements and international curfews, it was thought that those arrangements would help ease the situation considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the third runway has been built and is in operation, the same case does not exist. Now that Badgerys Creek is on schedule and planned to come into operation in 1999 there will be further opportunity for international aircraft, as the markets grows and as traffic grows, to utilise that alternative destination. The airlines do not have a case to argue, as they did back in 1987-88, that there be a shoulder period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we proposed, and the government agreed to, was that the number of inbound slots currently being used&mdash;that is, 35 out of the 42 available&mdash;be frozen and that as airlines move out of those slots those slots be surrendered. As we get closer to 1999, the number of international flights arriving in the shoulder periods will further reduce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes also, on the basis of evidence provided to us, that there is a capacity to move existing flights out of the shoulder periods, particularly in the morning, and into the ordinary periods&mdash;that is, post 6 a.m. We have that capacity for at least six months of the year. Depending on what the government does about Badgerys Creek in the future, it may even be possible to move to Badgerys Creek earlier. That has to also be borne in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were convinced that people suffer effects from aircraft noise. They have to be given adequate consideration in the arrangements for the management of airports. In the opinion of the members of the committee, at least a seven-hour period of freedom from aircraft noise is required. They should be free from noise from at least 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. from Monday to Friday. We also made a recommendation to look at extending it further on the weekends. The government is looking at that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that came up was aircraft getting push-back clearances. This means that aircraft are continuing to load ostensibly before 11 p.m. but not departing until 11 p.m. or just after 11 p.m. and then transiting northern Sydney for a considerable time after 11 p.m. causing great disruption. When we pressed that issue we found that it involved one particular cargo operator operating a Boeing 727 to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation that a new clause be inserted to prohibit take-offs to the north after 10.45 p.m. is based on taxiway clearances. Once taxiway clearance is given, then no aircraft may take off other than to the south after 10.45 p.m. We felt that that would give considerable relief to people affected by aircraft noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also became obvious to us that a number of propeller-driven aircraft wander around in uncontrolled airspace of Sydney at night at above 500 feet and below 2,000 feet. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to go out to Bankstown at 1 a.m. and hop on his private propeller-driven aircraft and go for a cruise over the Harbour Bridge, there is nothing stopping him. In the stillness of the night, when the ambient noise is at a very low level, the people of the northern areas of Sydney can be as disturbed by a low flying propeller-driven aircraft as others can be disturbed by much larger jet aircraft during the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be an investigation into those aircraft. It is quite clear that those aircraft can be managed. It is assumed by many people that those aircraft are originating and terminating at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. It was clear to us that they are not. Some propeller-driven aircraft are going from Sydney Kingsford Smith during the night, usually en route to Bankstown, or from Bankstown en route to Sydney Kingsford Smith. But there are other aircraft wandering about, either coming into Bankstown from the north or from the north-east or moving around in Sydney airspace that is uncontrolled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of penalties was raised with the committee. There is a recommendation, which has been accepted by the government, for an increase in the personal penalty up to a maximum of $20,000 and for corporations from $20,000 to $100,000. That gives a very clear indication to people that we need to let the airlines and the operators see that the government of the day is absolutely fair dinkum about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that was of constant concern to people coming before us was the noise hotline service. It was evident that that has not been operating in a way that provides satisfaction and information to people. People constantly complain that when you ring the hotline service you get an answering machine; you leave a message to be called back and no-one ever calls back. They ring to complain about an aircraft that is overhead, only to be told that the aircraft is not overhead&mdash;`There are no aircraft in the air because it is not showing on the chart.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter that needs to be looked at is that those aircraft registering on the charts are those carrying transponders, and the propeller driven aircraft moving around that do not have transponders are not showing up on the noise charts. That is another matter that needs to be looked at. I understand from the minister that that service is being looked at to be strengthened and greatly improved so that those people, when they are disturbed, do have a contact to make, can have their voice heard and can have information provided on what has been taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were surprised&mdash;given the run-up to the government's decision in 1989 to construct a third runway and the enormous clamour that came from the opposition, from the airline industry and from the tourism organisations&mdash;that there was this deafening silence from all of those parties in respect of aircraft noise and the problems that are occurring around Sydney now which they chose to ignore at the time they were making their representations. One of the greatest complaints we had before us was the enormous disruption that came from jet aircraft coming in at night, being forced to abort their landings, going around at a lower altitude across all of populated Sydney and nobody explaining what had happened. We had several cases where one got the impression that this was happening every week when in fact it had happened nine times in three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have recommended a provision, and the government has picked this up in the bill that is now before us, that in the circumstance where an aborted landing takes place&mdash;or a go-around, as it is called&mdash;the airline concerned must notify the required person or the registered authority of the circumstances. People will understand if it happened in the cause of safety&mdash;if the aircraft was on descent and an event occurred that made it in the interest of the safety of passengers on board for the aircraft to abort the landing&mdash;but they must be told promptly what has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on the other hand, the pilot chose to come in, in contravention of advice that weather conditions may not have been acceptable, then let the airline wear it. Either way, the airlines have a responsibility now to explain what their operations are. Those associated with the industry have to explain what their operations are and they similarly have to share responsibility for the disturbance that is being inflicted upon the people who live in the vicinity of the airport. I commend the bill to the House. I am very pleased, on behalf of our committee, to express our appreciation of the government for the strong and positive response, particularly by the minister, they have given to the recommendations and the advice in the report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

If it had been left to the government, if it had been left to the Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, this bill would not have occurred. It would not have entered the collective heads of the government to do something like this. It has occurred only because the Leader of the Opposition has decided, in his desire to represent his constituents and the people of Sydney&mdash;and, indeed, the people of Lowe, represented by Mary Easson&mdash;to do something to overcome the problem caused by this government's incompetence. Today we are debating something that will help ease the problem of aircraft noise over Sydneysiders' heads. But let it be understood that it is because of John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, that we are doing it here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill reflects very badly on the government because it highlights to us just how much the government has been on the back foot over this issue. The government has been on the back foot over the Sydney airport problems right from the day that the third runway was opened in November last year at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. It has been on the back foot right from day one. The government has reacted to public opinion. The government has acted only under duress to try to solve the problems. The government has not been honest with the people of Sydney and the government did not take the problems of Sydney airport seriously until the inevitable political backlash that it is now experiencing fell down upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's inaction has been the principal cause of the problems over Sydney airport. The government's inability to tell the people of Sydney the truth about the consequences of the opening of the third runway is also a principal cause of the problems that we are now experiencing in Sydney. The Minister for Transport is the butt of so much of the people's distress as a result of the problems of Sydney airport. We saw only last night on the television news, as the minister tried to make an announcement about insulating a number of houses in Sydney, the distress and the emotions that are being caused by the government's bad handling of this problem. We saw it on the television last night and we have seen it in the news over the last few months as tens of thousands of Sydneysiders have taken to the streets in an attempt to try to get the government to hear their concerns and to tell them the truth. But the undeniable fact is that the government has not been telling the people of Sydney the truth about Sydney's airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have got to understand that the amendments to be moved by the Leader of the Opposition today seek to reopen Sydney's east-west runway. The government will tell you, as the Minister for Transport has over a long period, that you cannot do it and that it is unsafe to reopen the east-west runway. I do not think, and many other people do not think, that it is true to say that it is unsafe to reopen the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you listen to the concerns of people in Sydney&mdash;the tens of thousands who have turned out to demonstrate&mdash;you will hear them say, `For goodness sake, would you please reopen the east-west runway at Kingsford Smith airport.' They know, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out in the debate today, that by reopening the east-west runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport you help to better share the noise problems around. You have an equitable distribution of the noise problems caused by the Sydney airport instead of this funnelling of the noise problems over people living in places like Drummoyne, which is in the honourable member for Lowe's electorate&mdash;a Labor held electorate&mdash;and the suburbs of Hunters Hill and so forth which are held by the Leader of the Opposition. So you have the call from these people saying, `Reopen the east-west runway,' but the government says, `You can't do it because it's not safe.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just find out why we cannot reopen Sydney's east-west runway. The truth was revealed in Laurie Oakes's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of December last year in which he referred to the section of Graham Richardson's autobiography which deals with the decision in 1989 to build the third runway at Sydney airport and which talks about a conversation that Robert Ray had with Gary Punch. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It was Keating who really swung it in the end," Ray said.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Keating is the one people should be mad at. He not only got the third runway decision through cabinet but was responsible for changes to the original plan which are now causing massive problems.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Oakes's article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original proposal was supposed to be that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than houses. Clever Keating changed that and sent them roaring over suburbia. The east-west runway was supposed to continue operating, but it was Keating who killed that idea, too, and ensured that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">all</EMPHASIS> planes operated on the north-south axis.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Laurie Oakes's reading of Graham Richardson's autobiography, which reveals to us for the very first time the truth about Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport. The decision to channel all of the noise over those people on the north-south axis of Sydney airport was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, was the butt of all of the hatred and emotion that has been generated as a consequence of the decision made by this government in 1989. Whilst it would be wrong of me to say that I feel a great deal of sympathy for the Minister for Transport, it is fair to say that he is copping the blame for a decision engineered by Paul Keating, the now Prime Minister of Australia, in the cabinet in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the truth of it is that the decision made to channel all that noise over the north-south axis of Sydney airport was made by the person who is now Prime Minister of Australia, and the Minister for Transport, his old mate, is the fall guy for that decision. But it is an extraordinarily incompetent way in which they have gone about implementing that decision. In 1989 we started with two runways&mdash;one north-south and one east-west. We spent $250 million of the taxpayers' money and we ended up with 1 1/2 runways because you cannot take off to the north on the new second parallel runway. We have in effect reduced the capacity of Sydney airport, having spent $250 million of the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only a Labor government that could introduce this type of clever management and clever outcomes. But this is the consequence of what they have done. They have, in the course of spending the $250 million and building the third runway, closed off the east-west runway. Their decision to close that, as I pointed out earlier, is a political one engineered by the now Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet today they say you cannot operate an east-west runway at Sydney airport. That is just pure bunkum, as everybody in the industry knows. I just heard the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) highlighting some of the airports, trying to debunk the argument put forward by the Leader of the Opposition that there are not a lot of airports around the world that have cross-runway operations going on. Yet there are many airports, as he well knows and failed to make the point in his address today, that do exactly that. There are cross-runway operations in Johannesburg, Amsterdam, Paris and San Francisco. They are all simultaneous operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this government tells us that, here in Australia at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, we cannot do the same thing that is done in those airports in other parts of the world. There are many other examples that you could pull out of the hat if you wanted to, but these are just some that were highlighted in a story put forward by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper late last year. I am reminded that between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. on 1 July this year Sydney (Kingsford Smith) airport ran simultaneous cross-runway operations. So it can be done, as indeed was confirmed by the representative from Civil Air&mdash;the union representing air traffic controllers&mdash;in another article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 17 December last year. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The controllers say they could devise new operational procedures to operate Sydney as a three-runway airport if the political and community will is there to re-open the east-west runway.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote the spokesman for Civil Air, the union representing air traffic controllers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We could re-open it I guess, but it would take time to work out the procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>So it can be done. We know it can be done because the Australian International Pilots Association has also confirmed it in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney on 15 June this year. I quote from a story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by Mark Riley:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a submission to the Senate inquiry into Sydney's aircraft noise problems, the pilots have called for the Government to reopen the east-west runway as the only way to ease the noise and air traffic congestion problems.</PARA>
<PARA>It also goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The submission says the new flight paths at Sydney have increased rather than decreased the aircraft noise problem.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have the people who fly into Sydney airport, who have an understanding of Sydney airport's needs and technical requirements and who have experiences in other parts of the world, telling us that it should be done. You have also got the air traffic controllers confirming to us that it can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The former Minister for Transport, Senator Collins, has also confirmed it twice in the Senate over the last few years. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out a statement that was made by Senator Collins in 1991, which vouched for the safe operations of the third runway if it were so chosen to continue with that third runway. On 29 November 1994, the former Minister for Transport, Senator Collins, said in answer to a question put by Senator Parer about the possibility of a simultaneous third runway operation at Sydney's airport:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA is in the position that if a decision is taken to reopen the east-west runway, it will make it workable.</PARA>
<PARA>So it can be done. You cannot believe the statements being made by the government that you cannot reopen the east-west runway in Sydney because it will not be safe because the experience in other countries around the world proves that it is safe. The experience and knowledge attained by those people who operate our air traffic control systems indicate that it can be done. The people who fly the aeroplanes indicate that it can be done. Indeed, just in the last little while the Board of Airline Representatives has indicated that it can, and indeed should, be done. Of course, the Regional Airlines Association has prepared a full and comprehensive submission which indicates that not only can you reopen the east-west runway, but you can make a number of changes to flight paths and operations at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport that would reduce the noise problems being experienced by Sydneysiders at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have information from international experts which confirms that the east-west runway can be reopened. I am talking of a letter that was written to Barry Cotter, the Mayor of Marrickville Council. William C. Hoffman, the president of a company called US Flight Transportation Associates Inc., confirms in a letter that was written to Mayor Cotter that you could have safe and efficient simultaneous operations from all three Kingsford Smith airport runways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter in which you direction you look, the pilots, the air traffic controllers, international airports&mdash;with the experience that they have achieved over the years&mdash;international experts, the Board of Airlines Representatives and the Regional Airlines Association of Australia all say that what the Leader of the Opposition is putting forward as an amendment to this bill is achievable and can make safe and efficient operations at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation today we are talking about trying to do something real and meaningful for the people of Sydney who have been absolutely besieged by the changes that this government has introduced at Kingsford Smith airport. These changes will help to reduce the noise impact. These changes, with the addition of the amendments to be moved by the Leader of the Opposition, have the potential not only to reduce the noise problems but to share the noise problems more equitably around Sydney. The amendments to be moved by the Leader of the Opposition will obviously be supported by those of us on this side of the House who have a real interest in this issue. I am sure that the amendments will be supported by people living in Sydney. The constant cry we hear from people in Sydney is, `For goodness sake, why don't they reopen the east-west runway?' The Leader of the Opposition, initially with his private member's bill to inscribe in legislation the curfew, and now with his foreshadowed amendments, best addresses the concerns of the people in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be an interesting test of the genuine representation by the honourable member for Lowe, a Labor member in this House who represents some of the worst affected people by the government's changes at Sydney airport, as to whether she is prepared to vote for her constituents for the Leader of the Opposition's amendments or whether she is prepared to turn her back on the best interests of her constituents and vote with the government to vote down the Leader of the Opposition's amendments which inscribe in legislation the wishes of her constituency. The people living in the electorate of Lowe, represented by Mary Easson, want to see the east-west runway reopened. As she enters the House today, it will be a very interesting test of the honourable member for Lowe's true representation of her constituents' needs if she is prepared to stand up for her constituency, to stand up for what she knows to be right, and vote for the Leader of the Opposition's amendments which best reflect the needs of her own constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one undeniable fact here: this bill, which does do something to help reduce the problem of Sydneysiders, is here only because of the Leader of the Opposition's initiative and drive on this particular issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sydney Airport Curfew Bill 1995 arises out of my suggestion that the private member's bill of the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), which was introduced into the House in June, was insufficient in that it chose to legislate the existing curfew regulations without attempting to improve the situation or to tackle the difficult problem of the existing shoulder period. I recommended that the bill be sent for discussion to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, with a view to its being able to tighten the curfew provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After examining the legislation with its inadequacies&mdash;namely, the flight quotas, the shoulder periods, the poor drafting concerning lack of community consultation, and inadequate penalties&mdash;I realised that the bill could not be successfully amended without the entire legislation being referred to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to note at this stage that the Leader of the Opposition has been talking about moving an amendment regarding the east-west runway. He also talked about it at the time his bill was in the House. But I notice that he did not bother to move it at that stage because he did not want the transport committee to examine that proposition. We would then have seen just how fraudulent it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I requested that the Morris committee report back to the parliament by 31 August so that no time would be lost in investigating this issue. This has occurred. The government has had several weeks to reflect, and its response to these issues is raised in the bill that we have before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a significantly improved bill from that which was proposed by the member for Bennelong. The new restrictions include: a reduction in quotas for international passenger movements during the curfew shoulder periods&mdash;5 a.m. to 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. to midnight; a requirement that each such movement be subject to individual vetting by the Department of Transport; and a requirement that all these movements be fully justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturdays and Sundays aircraft operations from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. will be required to take-off and land over Botany Bay, unless weather and traffic density prevent safe operations over water. For a normal weeknight, all departures after 10.45 p.m. will be required to take-off over Botany Bay to ensure aircraft are well clear of residential suburbs by 11 p.m. Large propeller-driven aircraft with over 34,000 kilograms maximum take-off weight will no longer be able to operate during the curfew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comprehensive consultation procedures will now allow wider community input into curfew decisions, and there will now be a requirement for full public scrutiny of any proposal to amend the curfew legislation. The penalties for curfew breaches will increase from the existing $25,000 to a maximum of $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other issues have been raised, such as reverse thrust of aircraft. Operators have to give detailed information as to why they would use reverse thrust, and if they do use it an explanation has to be given within seven days. I would also like to talk about the reduced movements. In the shoulder periods that I have often referred to, 14 landings or take-offs would occur during any week between 11 p.m. and midnight. As a result of this legislation, there will be a maximum of four on any night and no more than 35 landings during any week between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. Therefore, there will be a maximum of seven per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the proposal from the House of Representatives standing committee, the bill allows the regulations to lower but not to increase the permitted number of movements. In fact, there has been a decrease in the number of international flights of seven per week. There is also the recommendation that any flights outside the curfew go to Badgerys Creek airport when it is up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted with interest the member for Bennelong putting out press releases last week announcing that he was going to move an amendment to this bill. He was challenging me, as the member for Lowe, as to what I was going to do about this. He was taunting me, telling me what I should do. He was challenging me: should I cross the floor; should I support my party or should I look after my constituents? What an absolute hypocrite this man is. He knows full well that the opening of the east-west runway will do nothing for his people or my people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition knows the reason why it should not progress. In February 1989 he was taunting the government that we should proceed with the third runway. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interests of safety, airport facilities should be upgraded immediately including the construction of the third runway. The current congestion at the airport is causing increased noise pollution and becoming a serious threat both to travellers and local residents. The Government is playing carelessly with a situation that could too easily result in a major tragedy. The risk must be averted.</PARA>
<PARA>He was in favour of it then because he knew that Kingsford Smith airport was at maximum capacity with 55 movements an hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of submissions have been made to the Senate committee of inquiry that has been looking at this issue. It is safe to run cross-runways, but at what capacity? We know that it is safe at 55 movements an hour because we have had that before. In 1989 the decision was made to build a third runway at the urging of not only the Leader of the Opposition but many other members of the opposition. I have some lovely quotes to remind those opposite of what they said about it in those days. It was urged that we needed to up the capacity. The industry demanded it. We all know that the industry is growing at an enormous rate. We were told that we had to have a third runway to deal with the traffic. We had to have a maximum capacity on parallel runways of 85 movements an hour. The difficulty is that you cannot run cross-runways at 85 movements an hour. What is John Howard talking about? Certainly all the safety people say that. I have a good quote from the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). He should hang around a bit and we will come back to him later. The member for Bennelong knows full well that by opening the east-west runway to jet traffic you cannot safely have 85 movements an hour. I accept that you can have 55 movements an hour. But what do you do with the third runway? Perhaps you could use it for drag racing or rollerblading. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition might have some other suggestion for its use rather than waste the $500 million involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition knew that congestion was going to arise. He knew that we had to have some other facility to deal with the problem. Personally, I wish we had not gone ahead with the third runway at Kingsford Smith airport. Nevertheless, we have, and now we are left with the legacy and we have to try to find some way to resolve the problem for the people living under the flight path. Anyone who suggests that the honourable member for Bennelong&mdash;if he were in the position to do so&mdash;would do more than simply open the east-west runway for propeller-driven aircraft is fooling himself or herself. If the propeller-driven aircraft are put on the stub of the east-west runway&mdash;and that is not on an intersecting runway&mdash;it could be done safely. However, that means you up the capacity of Kingsford Smith airport once again and increase movements from 85 to closer to 95 or 100 per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that the slots for the jets on the north-south runway that fly over my constituents and over the member for Bennelong's constituents will be opened up for more jets and more noise. If I believed for one moment that there was a legitimate proposition of opening the east-west runway, sharing the pain, keeping the capacity, and doing it safely, I would cross the floor. But those opposite are hypocrites and they know darn well that it cannot be done. The opposition is playing for political mileage and we are not going to be fooled by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to some of these great quotes from the past about why we had to have the third runway in the first place. On 21 March 1989 in an interview with Mike Carlton on radio station 2GB the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I grew up under the flight paths in the area of St George of Sydney and know something of the politics of that area and I've always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents. There are a limited number of people who are affected by aircraft noise. The great bulk of them are only mildly affected and in any event bought their houses knowing full well that they were under flight paths. In any event there are many sections of my electorate in areas like Lane Cove and Hunters Hill that have just as much aircraft noise and are as frequently under flight paths as people living near the airport.</PARA>
<PARA>The interviewer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They may in fact get less if the third runway is built&mdash;the people around Lane Cove.</PARA>
<PARA>John Howard responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people will because you'll have the north-south pattern. I think the case for it on general interest grounds is absolutely overwhelming. Our policy is to build it. That has been our policy for the past six and a half years.</PARA>
<PARA>He was not alone: the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) also said, on 2 October 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government must ignore the advice of the NSW Opposition leader, Bob Carr, and order the immediate commencement of Sydney's third runway . . . . If Mr Carr was in charge of our nation's development we'd still be living in caves.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The critics of the EIS are acting like spoilt children. They didn't get what they wanted from the study and are now threatening to halt the project either in the courts or in cabinet. This is a dangerously short-sighted view which pays no attention to the significant social and economic benefits that the third runway will bring.</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad to see that the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) is in the chamber because I have a quote from him. On 13 January 1991 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the recently completed draft Environmental Impact Study . . . was prepared on some of the most exacting grounds yet seen in Australia. The EIS allows for three times the normal period for public input; provides $100,000 for groups opposed to the Third Runway to prepare submissions, and; has established a large number of Government funded information booths to display the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Cadman branded the opponents of the third runway as `short-sighted'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than see the irrefutable merits of the third runway, they have put self interest before Australia's long-term national interests, and they are jeopardising the long-term safety of travellers.</PARA>
<PARA>I also quote the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). On 20 February 1989 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third runway would increase the airport's capacity by as much as 40 percent and significantly ease congestion and safety worries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He told a conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the coalition stood by its cast iron guarantee that a third runway would be built at Sydney Airport as soon as it was elected to government.</PARA>
<PARA>We come back to John Howard again. It is quite difficult to understand the coalition's support for the reintroduction of cross-runway operations at Sydney airport given the strong safety reasons that they have put forward in the past for getting rid of them and in supporting parallel operations.

<PARA>It is no wonder that ordinary people are becoming cynical about politicians. I refer to the deception that the honourable member for Bennelong is trying to put on people who are affected by the flight path noise. I am only too well aware of the flight path and what it represents to my people and what they have to endure in Drummoyne and also areas adjoining the flight path such as Five Dock and Haberfield. That is why I have taken such an active interest in the Sydney Airport Consultative Committee and am trying to bring about some real changes and improvements in the flight procedures and environmental concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that one of the submissions to the Senate committee inquiry by the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Medical Board talks in detail about jet fuel emissions and the possible and additional known carcinogens and their impact on concentrated flight paths.

It would mean removing people who were in Kurnell and simply relocating them&mdash;and I am talking about 1,000 families. I know that the cost would be enormous, but we are being very short-sighted by not looking at an option when we have water there. Certainly it has been done in San Francisco and other places.

I notice in the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill one of the decisions made with regard to Kurnell is that there is a veering of the flight path to avoid the houses there. So I believe that the same logic could be applied to coming in around the harbour. It would mean that fewer people would be affected by noise&mdash;certainly the people whom I represent and all the people to the north and to the west. I look forward to the Senate committee's report to see what they come up with. That is something I will be fighting for because I believe that this is another option whereby you would not necessarily have to use the current parallel runways. Nevertheless, I say now what I said then about the east-west&mdash;and I have been consistent throughout&mdash;that many of my constituents have argued about the `share the pain' philosophy. That is very understandable, because when people are affected by noise they naturally grab at any straw to alleviate their pain. The idea of opening up the east-west runway has a lot of appeal, but it is only when you look at it that you realise that it just does not hold up. The truth is that, in the end, all we will be doing will be allowing the propeller-driven aircraft to go and not removing any of the jets. In fact, it will mean increased jet noise over the homes of the people whom I represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote the views of a couple of people from different parts of industry on the parallel runways. The first is a media release on airlines endorsing the operational efficiency of the parallel runways. A joint press statement issued by Qantas and Ansett dated 18 September states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept the advice from the regulatory authorities and from our technical experts that safety and efficiency would be diminished by permanently reopening the East West Runway to jet movements," they added. "While in practice it has never closed, and is used when prevailing weather does not permit parallel operations, the key point is that intersecting runways are inherently less efficient and less safe.</PARA>
<PARA>A media release dated 14 August 1995 by Air Services Australia states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parallel runways provide significantly higher capacity than intersecting runways and are the most effective means of meeting the growing demand for access to Australia's major international destinations.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I quote Hazelton Airlines, in case anyone is in any doubt about what I have said about propeller-driven aircraft. In December 1994 they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give maximum capacity, it is imperative to open 07-25 runway for Regional Aircraft . . . that have a very low noise factor. In fact a bus on the road would make more noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Every NON-JET aircraft taken out of the mainstream "traffic flow" allows more jet traffic onto 16/34 runways (there should not be a noise problem as this procedure has been used for many years).</PARA>
<PARA>So they are arguing that they can put them out over the east-west and they certainly can. But let nobody in the north-south affected by the flight paths be unaware of the fact that it would mean an increased number of jets. In conclusion, I believe that the flight movements at Kingsford Smith airport should be capped. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sydney Airport Curfew Bill that the government has brought in today is only in response to a piece of legislation proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. The government has taken 12 years to even consider the problems of Sydney airport's needs and the movement of aircraft in the Sydney area. It is a surprising thing to the opposition that the government has taken their proposal, their legislation, their suggestion of putting in place by legislation a curfew at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport; that it has taken that initiative to produce from the government a report from a parliamentary committee and then the legislation preventing the flight of aircraft between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. in the Sydney region. The fact of the matter is that if the person who prepared this report for the House of Representatives had been the Hon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If, instead of the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, being in charge, Mr Morris had been in charge, we would have had quite a different result. There would have been care in the decision taking process. There would have been effective consultations with the community. There would have been a decision based on economic and environmental grounds, which would produce the best results for the city of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is the minister. He is under the thumb of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister got smart and thought that he would play games, not only with the flight paths of aircraft but, I contend, with aircraft safety in the way he interfered with the recommendations of the properly appointed authorities who were recommending continual use of the north-south runway out over Botany Bay, with occasional use of the east-west runway. Those have been the recognised industry conditions on which the construction of the third runway took place. That is why the opposition has supported this consistently and that is why, in government, with the Hon. Wal Fife as minister, we took the decision to build the third runway. It was simply because we knew it would alleviate the problem of sound pollution for thousands of people in the Sydney area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal was that aircraft would take off over Botany Bay and land over Botany Bay and, when weather conditions made it untenable to continue that process, the east-west runway would be used. It had not been contemplated, until the Prime Minister got into the act, that there would be take-offs and landings to the north of Kingsford Smith over the suburbs to the north of the north-south runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is just too smart by half. He organised his friend the Minister for Transport to have a motorbike parked handy after a certain preselection in which there was some very unusual activity. In this instance, he has organised his friend again to fiddle with aircraft safety and with the general economic management of Mascot. Consistently we are hearing both the minister and members of the government saying, `Safety is a factor and it is impossible to build the numbers to a sufficient level unless we exclusively use the north-south runways.' I quote, for the benefit of the House, from an interview on 23 November 1994 between Kerry O'Brien, Geoff Parish and a number of others, including the minister, Mr Laurie Brereton MP. Mr Brereton says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That means by the end of next year, they are not allowed to schedule more than 85 take-offs and landings in any one hour.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister is saying to Kerry O'Brien that the maximum that the north-south runway configuration will take is 85 take-offs and landings in any one hour. Further in the interview Kerry O'Brien says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So presumably a significant part of that increased usage is from business people who are doing their work to boost our economy, but we can't accommodate them.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister Brereton responds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I think the economic recovery has certainly been a considerable factor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He refuses to answer the question&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in this increased demand.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in that same interview Kerry O'Brien draws the minister's attention to several factors. I will start by quoting Minister Brereton, who states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if I can turn to the safety considerations which support the environmental approval, the Civil Aviation Authority have indicated to me that on safety grounds they would not be prepared to run a cross-runway while they are operating parallel runway operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you would be aware of the study prepared for the FAC by an American consulting company called Flight Transportation Associates in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister Brereton responds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a matter of fact I am not, but tell me about it.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, it argues that you can operate all three runways, including east-west, safely and move up to 94 planes an hour.</PARA>
<PARA>Neither the minister nor anybody in the government has refuted the proposal that the FAC commissioned a firm of consultants to prepare an economic assessment of what is the best management of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. The best economic management of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is to use all three runways. By doing so, it is possible to increase the number of movements by 15 or 20 per cent. The government has refused to acknowledge that. Instead, it has rushed headlong into the development of Badgerys Creek as an alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today to prevent aircraft flying at night-time is a reaction to the initiative taken by the Leader of the Opposition. So there we have the facts. It is possible for us to make greater use of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, but the Prime Minister and his friend the Minister for Transport refuse to do so. They are prepared to dump this problem on a whole new section of Sydney that has never before experienced aircraft noise. This impost is damaging to the lifestyles, health and property valuations of people in areas such as Mascot and Rockdale, which are in the seats of the Minister for Transport and other members of the Labor Party. That process of development and lifestyle came about with the knowledge that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport was there and operating. It has not affected lifestyles unless people were prepared to let that happen. It has not affected property values or business in any way unless people were unprepared for what has occurred there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the northern suburb of Hunters Hill, in the electorate of Mitchell, and in areas such as Carlingford and North Rocks, lifestyles have changed dramatically. Twenty-six miles out of Sydney, in the Carlingford-North Rocks area, which is at a high elevation because the topography rises the further west that you go in that part of Sydney, aircraft are now coming over homes at heights never dreamed of by the residents when they purchased those properties. Children, the elderly and the sick are being affected by a complete change of lifestyle&mdash;one that is endorsed by the current Minister for Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how the Labor Party can defend this process of sudden change without any compensation or thought of the lifestyles of anybody. It is a sheer political decision based on the fact that they have the power and the right to make the decision. They have exercised that right despite the need for consultation and despite the reprise and the requests of others. If that is the selfish exercise of power that is being adopted by the Minister for Transport, he is setting a precedent which may seriously disadvantage him if others decide to act in the same way. It has not been the process of government, to my knowledge, for a minister to selfishly exercise power to advantage himself and disadvantage not a political opponent but hundreds of thousands of citizens who are residents of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that people are steamed up, and no wonder that they turn out in force and with some violence against this ad hoc decision making, particularly when they know and understand that the FAC at its commissioned inquiry has established that the government made a wrong decision and is not making the best use of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. We can go through the documents, through the process and through the story of what has happened at Sydney (Kingsford Smith), but the result is that Paul Keating, the Prime Minister, through his minister, has decided that he will change and disadvantage a large proportion of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has never been the argument of the coalition that that should occur; it has always been our argument that there needs to be a balance and a spreading of some of the disadvantage. I was amazed to find that there was a hotel constructed, quite out of the blue evidently, to the north of this shortened runway at Mascot, limiting its use completely. So the government has made a series of decisions which are faulty and not in the best interests of the people of Sydney, nor in the best interests of aircraft travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the submissions to the committee that has just conducted this inquiry and to the work done by the Hon. Peter Morris, who ought to have been the minister conducting this whole process but has not been. According to the submissions, the doctors at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital are finding it extremely difficult to carry on their tasks; patients and nurses are finding it difficult to communicate, and it is difficult to attract new staff. The care of people is mentioned in this way in the submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of such a noise level repeated every 2-3 minutes is clearly detrimental to good medical care . . . Sleep is essential for healing, both physical and psychological. It is simply not possible to provide medical care for seriously ill people in such an environment.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have a government without any care for the needs of Sydney, a government which for crass political purposes is making a decision that is demonstrably&mdash;economically, environmentally, health-wise; in every way that you can look at it&mdash;of least benefit to the people of Sydney. That is bad enough, but the people in my area have written hundreds of complaints about the change in their lifestyle. They are sick of the government, and they are just looking forward to the next election so they can clout a government that disregards the simple basics of consultation and communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report presented by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure is heavily into communications and consultation because it knows how poor the minister has been in that process. One only has to read through the conclusions of that report to realise that, amongst their recommendations&mdash;many of which the government has decided to pick up&mdash;are recommendations initiated by the Leader of the Opposition but which, for the purposes of covering the tracks of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson), were pushed off to a parliamentary committee. Surprise, surprise&mdash;the parliamentary committee, dominated by the Australian Labor Party, comes back with basically the same recommendations as Mr Howard had in his legislation, but of course it has now been laundered through a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the government brings this legislation to the House. When one looks at the committee recommendations, it is obvious that the committee felt that the communications process, the consultation with people, was extremely poor. One only has to look at the simple table of complaints about international passenger jet aircraft movements to realise the seriousness of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of complaints in the three years under examination by the committee&mdash;that is, June 1991 to June 1994&mdash;totalled 327. Two-thirds of those complaints came from the north. There is a part for the government to play to do something about it, but it will not play it. It will put in place a curfew when it could be making a totally better use of Mascot by opening up the east-west runway. That is an essential thing to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to say something about what is happening in the relationship between these proposals and Badgerys Creek. It appears that the government has decided to go ahead with Badgerys Creek. The minister is optimistic about having the runway open by the end of 1999. That is the height of expectations and cannot be met. It is so optimistic that I do not believe the infrastructure of rail, road and airport, linked together with Sydney's Kingsford Smith, can possibly be completed by the end of 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked the minister to provide for me a detailed summary of the works program to achieve this process. The minister keeps telling me that before Badgerys Creek can go ahead there will be a full environmental and economic study about how it will be done. That has not even started. The people in western Sydney are asking when the government is going to get active in this regard, when the government will do something and when the government will start communicating with them about their intentions for Badgerys Creek. The people of my electorate and the electorates nearby in western Sydney are looking down the barrel of the gun of aircraft noise and no curfew. The legislation we are considering today puts into law the fact that there will be no curfew at Sydney West airport. This is the first time that Sydney West will have no curfew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) was involved in that decision. It would be very interesting, in light of his statements to the local press in the area, to see whether he stands by this legislation, which says that the curfew will not apply in Sydney West. Aircraft directed to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport after 11 o'clock will be diverted to land at Sydney West. That is the intention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the member and other members in the west have expressed their concern about what are going to be the sound footprints for Badgerys Creek when it opens up. In some areas, they face the prospect of the double whammy of Badgerys Creek coming on one side of them and Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport coming on the other side. The crossover point is along the ridge of Pennant Hills Road in Sydney. As best we can determine, for those residents on that elevated area, there will be noise pollution from both Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to the government to come clean. All its constituents are in western Sydney. It claims to represent them, yet it treats them like mushrooms. It will not communicate with them. There are ministers and parliamentary secretaries there. None of them can get a statement out of the government. None can provide effective information about the intentions of the government. None can find out what sorts of aircraft will fly, except we know that they will be neither fully international nor fully domestic aircraft. It will be a hybrid runway there. At some time in the future we will get full aircraft use of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that it will be one of the big boosts for western Sydney in employment coming up to the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000. I accuse the government of being unprepared for the Olympics. I condemn the government for the lack of consultation and information that they are providing to the residents of western Sydney both in the construction and use of Badgerys Creek or Sydney West. I particularly condemn them for their failure to alleviate the problems over north-western Sydney which have been created by the abuse of the minister's power with regard to Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. Those elevated areas of Sydney are copping as much noise as many areas closer to the airport. Because of their elevation, the topography and the air movement around Sydney, on still nights&mdash;periods when the residents of those areas have been used to rest and quiet&mdash;the rest and quiet of residents has been disturbed by the crass political manipulations of aircraft movements, safety and economy by the Minister for Transport and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not fit to govern because they do not trust the people. They will not communicate with the people. Neither will they do anything to make a decision that is going to be in the best interests of all the people of Sydney.

It is time they looked at the total picture and came up with a decision that was in the interests of all the residents of the Sydney area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of provisions, and for the record it is worth restating a few of them. First of all, the new restrictions include a reduction in quotas for international passenger movements during the curfew shoulder periods&mdash;that is, from 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. and from 11 p.m. to midnight&mdash;and a requirement that each such movement be subject to individual vetting by the Department of Transport. There will be further restrictions in relation to Saturdays and Sundays. Aircraft operations between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. will be required to take off and land over Botany Bay unless weather and traffic density prevent safe operations over water. All departures after 10.45 p.m. will be required to take off over Botany Bay to ensure aircraft are well clear of residential suburbs by 11 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Large propeller-driven aircraft over 34,000 kilograms maximum take-off weight will no longer be able to operate during the curfew period. Comprehensive consultation procedures will now allow much wider community input into curfew decisions. There will be full public scrutiny of any proposals to amend the curfew legislation. Of course, there will be an increase in the penalty provisions for curfew breaches from the existing $25,000 to $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these new restrictions have come about because the government has been going through a very comprehensive process following the opening of the third runway and all of the contingent issues that have arisen since that time. In relation to consultation, the processes have improved. I am one who believes that, in terms of consultation, the original processes that led to the third runway decision were totally inadequate. I certainly hold the view that those who clamoured for the building of the third runway and to heck with the consequences were totally irresponsible in the course of action they followed to pursue that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth going back over the record to see who were the big advocates to build a third runway at any consequence, who kept forcing this issue along and who are now misrepresenting the impacts of the original EIS on the third runway. A great many of them sit opposite us. The issue was raised by the Leader of the Opposition in February 1989; the shadow minister for transport, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), in December 1988; and the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), in January 1991. Given the speech we have just heard, it is interesting that on 11 January 1991 the member for Mitchell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a start on the third runway this year, genuine safety problems would develop due to increased congestion on the current runways. The politicians advocating for cancellation of the third runway project should be more concerned about the genuine safety and environmental issues for their constituents rather than phoney political points.</PARA>
<PARA>Now we are getting the phoney political points. They are coming from over that side of the chamber. The clear implication of the fact that a proper process was not followed, that there was not a proper understanding of the potential impacts of the building of the third runway in terms of not only air safety but also environmental impacts across Sydney, has now come home to roost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EIS at that time did identify that there would be a change with the parallel operation of the two north-south runways. It was made clear in the EIS that there were going to be some losers but many winners in noise impact. The Liberal state government of the time came out publicly and said that the EIS highlighted that the number of people seriously affected would reduce from 54,700 to 26,900 and those moderately affected would reduce from 170,000 to 82,000. Those things were known and highlighted as a virtue by the Liberal state government under Nick Greiner back in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How was the change in noise impact going to occur? It was going to occur because of the greatly diminished impact of the third runway. It was only going to be used when the wind velocity was such that it needed to be used for safety reasons and when the use of the two parallel north-south runways was prohibited. Those things were known. Now we are told, `Yes that was true. The state government made those claims. That was in the EIS.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition did not read the studies and was not aware of that because he kept advocating the building of the third runway at all cost. Admittedly, the boundaries of the Bennelong electorate have changed since that time. The Leader of the Opposition now pretends that a solution to Sydney's aircraft noise problems would be a sharing of the pain, as he describes it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly one who thinks there needs to be better planning of the overall aviation needs of Sydney. I do not think the third runway was the right solution to those problems, but a slogan about sharing the pain is not going to change any of the issues. We need to make sure at this stage that there is a comprehensive plan recognising where the shortcomings were in the past. We need to recognise that the curfew restrictions at Kingsford Smith airport need to be toughened up dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the recommendations of the Morris committee, the parliament is now in a position to proceed vigorously to ensure that there is a toughening up of the curfew restrictions. Frankly, many of the things that have been allowed to occur at Kingsford Smith airport are unacceptable to residents in my electorate and many other electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to get a solution to the problem and a proper understanding of those issues has been well nigh impossible. Even getting decent noise monitoring equipment into parts of Sydney which the original EIS said were not going to be affected by noise has proved impossible. When you ask the authorities for information on this, that proves very difficult as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason all that has occurred is that there has not been adequate consultation in the past. There has not been a process that has genuinely involved the people of Sydney in proper airport planning. The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has quite rightly brought forward the curfew bill at this stage as a very important part of trying to address some of the core concerns that residents throughout Sydney have with regard to the level of aircraft noise in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For anybody to suggest that the reopening of the east-west runway is going to solve those problems is not right. Everybody knows that that will mean that there will be more prop aircraft on the east-west runway and more jets thundering up and down the north-south corridors&mdash;the very issue that is causing concern to the residents who ring me. The Leader of the Opposition actually wants to maximise this problem and perhaps have 10 additional jet movements an hour to make the problem more acute than it already is for the residents of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a solution to the air traffic needs of Sydney. It is not a solution to the growth in air traffic that is going to go through Sydney in the years ahead. We need  long-term, comprehensive, properly planned and well-considered solutions. There was agitation from all sorts of vested interests in the lead-up to the building of the third runway, whether from the tourism industry or other industries. This agitation was aided and abetted and actively connived in by the airlines and the FAC and others all played their part in encouraging that ill-considered, ill-conceived approach to aircraft planning in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those things need to be treated in a different fashion in the future. That is the lesson from what has occurred. This curfew bill is one of the processes that needs to be followed to remedy those short-sighted planning processes of the past. I come back to the opposition's humbug on the issue which is that we should reopen the east-west runway. The consequence of that would be more jet noise over those same suburbs that the member for the Mitchell and others have talked about in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any doubt about that, members should look at what Hazelton Airlines said its approach is to the issue. They said they want to get the prop aircraft back on the east-west runway, and the rest of the airline industry said, `You beaut. That means we can get more jets up and down the north-south corridor.' All of those things are unacceptable. A better solution needs to be found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mitchell, as I said, back in 1991 was one of those agitating for the building of the third runway. Now we have a discussion today that brings in the issue of Badgerys Creek. I want to spend a little time referring to that as well. If we do not learn the lessons of the appalling planning process that has occurred in relation to consultation and development of the airport at Mascot in the way we develop Badgerys Creek airport, then the whole community is entitled to say that there is something dramatically wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made it clear that in the development of Badgerys Creek it is going to ensure a process is followed that gives proper community consultation and takes full account of the need to update the whole environmental process that was the subject of the original EIS for Badgerys Creek in 1985. I and a number of my colleagues have been pressing for that to occur. There has been a series of developments in relation to the land around Badgerys Creek in the last 10 years and, just as importantly, the experience of what has occurred at Sydney airport can be learned from in the planning of Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the noise monitoring ANEF arrangements that were adopted as the model in the original EIS for Kingsford Smith airport have been shown to be totally inadequate. Areas such as parts of Parramatta were not incorporated into noise corridors of any significant note in relation to the third runway, yet we are still getting that noise level. On the development of the original EIS for Badgerys Creek, some of the same assumptions in relation to noise contours were repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has given an assurance that there will be that updating of the process of the EIS&mdash;full consultation not only on the noise issues but also on the broader environmental issues of water quality and other issues that go to the development of a new airport at Badgerys Creek. A clear understanding has been achieved with the minister that there will be a strong proposition that movement in and out of Badgerys Creek at night will be out to the south-west through a corridor which has not had the population, and therefore does not have the same environmental or residential amenity concerns, that occurs as you move back from the north-east of the airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had a clear commitment from the minister to make sure there is consultation about the flight path planning process, to again ensure that every effort is made to minimise the potential impacts on residents through western Sydney from the development of the airport. In addition, in recent times, the government has made commitments to build the major road infrastructure, with the western orbital link and the widening of Elizabeth Drive, to provide the proper road infrastructure to the airport, and then to link that back in to the main road link back to Sydney from the west, the M4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also critical&mdash;and the government has agreed it is very important&mdash;that the rail link to Badgerys Creek should proceed as soon as possible. Up to this stage, the state government has not been willing to commit the resources to proceed with that rail link to Badgerys Creek. My view is that to plan Badgerys Creek effectively, to make sure not only in terms of the airport but in terms of the other infrastructure that will develop in the region, and to meet the public transport needs of western Sydney to and from Badgerys Creek, it will be critical that we get a proper road link to Badgerys Creek as part of the airport development and also a comprehensive rail link that links back to the western line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things must proceed if we are going to ensure that we have learned the lessons from the problems associated with Kingsford Smith airport. It is up to the parliament to ensure&mdash;not only in passing this legislation, because that does toughen up the curfew requirements as far as Kingsford Smith airport is concerned, but as we come through the range of issues relating to Badgerys Creek&mdash;that we make sure all of the residents of Sydney do not have additional aircraft noise problems visited upon them and that there is proper planning of the integration of air traffic to the two airports as that emerges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition on the one hand came in today and talked about the reopening of the east-west runway. On the other hand, he is sending out mail around his electorate saying, `Not only have we got to reopen the east-west runway but we have got to fast-track Badgerys Creek.' There is no commitment in the material he is sending out to his electorate to say, `We have to make sure that we overcome the problems about the environmental concerns and other important issues relating to transport infrastructure and the like and that we do not repeat the problems of KSA at Badgerys Creek.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of those things are covered. All he says is that they will fast-track Badgerys Creek and reopen the east-west runway. None of the other important safeguards, which the residents in western Sydney are concerned about and that the member for Mitchell referred to, were mentioned. They are the things that need to be incorporated as part of a comprehensive package to meet the air safety needs of Sydney in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> During the debate reference has also been made to this whole question of simultaneous operations with the parallel runways and the east-west runway arrangement. People are saying that there is no safety issue involved. They dismiss experts such as Dr Ratner, who has looked at this issue extensively and said that simultaneous operations inevitably increase the risks, particularly as the volume of traffic grows through the airport. The Leader of the Opposition says, `We all know that that is not true. No-one should take any notice of those sorts of things.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even at the busiest airport in the world, Heathrow in London, where there are two parallel runways and the runway that operates as a cross-runway, the cross-runway is used 1 1/2 per cent of the time. Why is it just 1 1/2 per cent of the time? It is not just because of wind considerations. The authorities at Heathrow have been exploring all of the options to ensure they have the best possible air safety at Heathrow. What conclusion have they come to? That parallel runways operations are far safer operations than cross-runway operations. A similar situation arises at Los Angeles airport where there are four parallel runways and there is not a cross-runway. Again, the authorities at that very busy airport are saying, `We know that is the safest way of having air safety ensured.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been discussions about building a further runway at Heathrow airport, although those discussions have not led anywhere at this stage. Again, the implication from what is being done is that we should not jeopardise air safety in whatever approach is taken and that additional cross-runway arrangements would only serve to intensify the risk at a very busy airport because of simultaneous type operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to Sydney airport, the EIS consistently made clear that the development of the parallel runway arrangements was superior in terms of air safety to the alternative approaches. If we are worried about sharing the noise, we are surely worried about making sure that we just do not increase the number of jets that move up and down the north-south corridors in the way that the Leader of the Opposition's proposal would inevitably lead to. It is beyond comprehension that, in this day and age, we would actually see such a bandaid as a solution to a very major problem that very many people in Sydney are raising as a legitimate concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need strong, concerted action starting with the stronger curfew measures introduced by the government. It is worth noting again that the Leader of the Opposition's original bill, which came in as a private member's bill, did not have the strong commitments as far as the shoulder periods are concerned. It did not have the increased penalties and the tougher regime to ensure tougher compliance with the airport curfew. It did not include any additional provisions relating to Saturday and Sunday mornings and evenings to try to increase the level of comfort and lower the level of noise that residents were feeling throughout the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When many of the authorities raised these issues, all we had was this bland statement: `Well, those things just don't count. This is just a decision being made to protect one or two.' We need, first of all, to get the airport curfew measures applied rigidly by the authorities and to make sure that there is proper compliance with those measures. That is one of the areas where I think there has been a lack of effort put in until very recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that many aircraft are still not conforming as rigorously as they should be with the agreed flight path corridors. It is clear that major work still needs to be done in areas that were outside the original study into noise impacts, because those impacts are real. We need to look at all the alternatives so that we get a better operation in terms of air safety and in having less impact on the residents of Sydney who are being severely affected by this problem of aircraft noise. The government has a real solution to address those issues. We should focus on that rather than the sort of sloganising that we have had from opposition speakers today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Confused and abused'&mdash;that is the slogan of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in his dealing with the mishandling of Kingsford Smith airport. He has confused the people as to the facts and abused the people who have to suffer the outcome of his mismanagement. It is not mismanagement because he is careless, sloppy or any of those things. It is mismanagement because he has deliberately set out to disadvantage people who live in Liberal electorates&mdash;to remove those of his own electorate from a fair sharing of the noise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has said in his speech earlier today, that the opposition is asking for fairness and equity&mdash;that there be a fair distribution of the noise that comes from Kingsford Smith airport, not a concentration of it in a way that is totally unfair and inequitable. I will quote to you from a letter of one of the many constituents who write to me. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know it is very difficult for anyone who does not live under the flight path to really understand the suffering of residents. There is absolutely no respite from the constant bombardment of aircraft noise and pollution&mdash;seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. We all feel very betrayed by the political process. Furthermore, many residents feel great anger and mistrust at any attempt to further entrench operations at KSA.</PARA>
<PARA>Another writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to urge you to resist any moves to the privatisation of Kingsford-Smith. The airport is a national disgrace and, given the current turmoil over its efficiency operations, noise problems and future capacity, I urge you to encourage your colleagues to resist privatisation at this time. The country needs a visionary and statesmanlike solution to the airport debacle before the Olympic Games. Clearly, the visionary Paul Keating is not going to provide this, and we are relying on the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA>Again and again, in letter after letter, they say, `Please don't allow the privatisation at this time until that problem is dealt with.' The Liberal Party has heard that plea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain committed to the principle of privatisation, but we have said that we will not support the legislation of the government to privatise Kingsford Smith airport until such time as the noise problem is dealt with, there is a fair and equitable distribution of the noise problem and, further, the east-west runway is open to normal actions by aircraft to allow that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard a lot of cant in this chamber this afternoon about safety, about allegedly caring for individuals. Don't give us that. This is a highly political debate. The winner takes all. It has nothing to do with caring about the safety or the health of those people who are affected. Do you know what really underpins the absolute nonsense of the claim that we just heard the likes of Mr Elliott give us? It is very simple: we cannot have intersecting runways&mdash;I have heard speaker after speaker on the government side, and I heard Mr Brereton earlier today, say&mdash;because it is not safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Senate inquiry, evidence after evidence has been given that that is absolute rubbish; it is safe. But the final underpinning of the misleading statement of the government is this: Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth all have intersecting runways; they all operate like Sydney used to operate for 40 years. For 40 years we have had the east-west runway operating. For 40 years we have managed to keep it safe. Now we still have Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth operating as we used to operate, and operating as we say Kingsford Smith airport should operate now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are you telling us, Mr Brereton? Are you telling us that somehow it is okay for Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth residents to be at risk and not safe but it is not okay for Sydney people? Do we have one standard for Sydney and another for the rest of Australia? We know very well that as a government you only care for those who belong to your groups. You sacrifice individuals to your collectivist deals. We know that well. But here we have a whole city. Are you saying that those in Sydney are not as smart as those in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth? Is that what you are saying? What absolute rubbish!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By reopening that runway we can start to see some fairness and equity back in the system. Laurie Brereton said, `You are running the airlines argument.' Really! Qantas and Ansett have both said that they are opposed to the reopening of the runway. Why? There is a whole variety of reasons that we can ask the minister about. Dare I say there is a bit of unfair pressure from somewhere? The bottom line is that there has been a plea from the people of Sydney that this question of Kingsford Smith airport has to be dealt with in a logical, fair and equitable manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like many of you, I was very often confused about what the minister was saying: it just did not seem to make sense. What is it about our Sydney technicians, engineers and computer experts that they cannot get that new tower open? Do we really think that they are thick and are not able to do the job? Of course not! Dare I say it is a political decision and there is no way that that new tower will open before an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing: as I said, I bothered to find out some of the facts. There is a most interesting set of facts of which I think we need to be aware. An instruction says that aircraft have to come down to 3,000 feet with 80 per cent of power operating before they are allowed to do a great loop to come in to land at Kingsford Smith airport. It is there that we hear this excessive noise, yet I am told&mdash;and believe&mdash;that in fact those aircraft can come in to land from 12,000 feet above Sydney airport with idle power and then come in on the loops and land, diminishing the noise and pollution by a factor that would be not only noticeable but could make people's lives bearable again. Let me read again from another of these letters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will be aware of the great public concern in Sydney, particularly in those areas affected by aircraft noise and pollution, about the environmental impact of Sydney airport's operation since the opening of the so-called third runway.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have this funny incidence of the Labor Party saying, `We are opening the third runway,' but it is one of those two-edged tricks again where three actually means two. You opened another one but you closed the one that was already operational. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among the suburbs most affected&mdash;although this is still not publicly recognised by the Labor government&mdash;are the Liberal electorates of North Shore, including Bennelong, North Sydney and Bradfield, and even as far as Pittwater.</PARA>
<PARA>That is perfectly correct. I have a constituent who lives up the hill from my house. She says that the noise is so shattering that when the aircraft come her whole house shakes. That is not necessary. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Residents of these suburbs believe that the privatisation of the Sydney and the future Sydney West airports at this time, while such serious environmental management problems exist, would be disastrous. We believe that the premature privatisation would entrench the problem for the next 99 years.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard their plea. There will be no privatisation of Kingsford Smith airport before this problem is dealt with because the Labor Party cannot gets its legislation through without our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain committed to the principle, but we see the correctness of the argument in the sense that it is about fairness and equity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did not say that. Let us look at what has happened in the last couple of years. The government has been running a substantial budget deficit as part of the process of getting the economy back onto a growth path. The surpluses that we had at the end of the 1980s, for four years&mdash;the only surpluses the Commonwealth has ever run under the modern budgeting system&mdash;went with the recession and the attempts by the government to get the economy moving again. That led to more government borrowing, clearly, but in the last couple of years we have seen that foreign debt, as a percentage of GDP, has come down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that there is some automatic link between government borrowing and foreign debt is absurd. In fact, if you look at other countries where there is, in many cases, much more government borrowing than there is in Australia&mdash;in fact, in most of them&mdash;you find that we have relatively small levels of government borrowing. Our level of government debt is in the last three or four of OECD countries. We are not a country with large amounts of government debt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. I must say that it is, of course, an allegation that is continually coming from the opposition. And the Leader of the Opposition said words to that effect today in, I think, an interview with 2GB. But it is a common refrain that this government has failed on economic growth and has not been able to produce sufficient growth to bring unemployment down significantly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, actually, the Leader of the Opposition must be confusing the situation today with when he was in office because that was certainly a true description of what happened when he was in office&mdash;when he had high inflation, high unemployment and very little economic growth. And his record stands in sharp contrast with that of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly have delivered on economic growth. The June quarter national accounts, as members are aware, showed us that we had had 16 quarters of consecutive economic growth which equalled the previous record. We can be confident that in September we will go beyond that and break that record by establishing 17 quarters and we can expect to go on from there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last three years economic growth has averaged four per cent&mdash;in fact, just over four per cent&mdash;and the unemployment rate has fallen by three per cent since October 1993. So where is this suggestion coming from, in terms of any analysis of the facts, about inability to obtain growth, inability to bring the unemployment rate down? It has been happening in spades in the last two or three years&mdash;happening in spades. The consensus amongst private sector forecasters is that growth is going to continue for the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent survey by Consensus Economics&mdash;this is a London based body which polls private sector forecasters&mdash;asked respondents to forecast quarterly growth for Australia out to the June quarter of 1997. Those respondents expect quarterly growth to remain positive over that entire period. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, they are saying that they expect the Australian economy to show continuous growth for at least 24 quarters. That is six years of continuous growth, and I remind the House that the best that the Australian economy achieved when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer for 5 1/4 years was five quarters of consecutive growth. But in the view of the Consensus Economics respondents, we are set for six years of continuous economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if you look back at the record of the Leader of the Opposition over his whole period in office as Treasurer, economic growth averaged 2.6 per cent. For us it has been 3 1/2 per cent&mdash;so virtually a one per cent increase. If we had simply maintained the Leader of the Opposition's rate of growth when he was Treasurer, Australia's GDP today would be some $45 billion less than it currently is. Our growth performance compares very well with that of other industrialised countries. Over the last 12 years the average GDP growth across 25 OECD countries has been 2 3/4 per cent&mdash;that is the average for all the Western industrialised countries. Ours has been 3 1/2 per cent, so we have three-quarters of a per cent better than the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest OECD economic outlook forecast that this good performance will continue. It said that we were the second fastest OECD growth economy in 1994. They expect us to be the fifth fastest in 1995 and the fourth fastest in 1996. So where is this inability to generate growth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the latest poll by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, which is much referred to by the opposition for some purposes in terms of these tables at the back of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, has a table which shows growth amongst the 15 most advanced industrial countries. That shows that, according to their respondents, in 1995 the second fastest growth country will be Australia. And for 1996 the same thing again&mdash;they expect us again to be the second fastest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wherever you turn in terms of what the forecasters are saying, be it the OECD, be it the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, be it Consensus Economics, you see this picture of Australia being expected to do exceedingly well in economic growth this year and next year. All this talk about there being an inability of Australia to grow, to generate jobs and to get unemployment down is just so much poppycock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits are flowing through to ordinary Australian households, principally and obviously through employment which has grown by 330,000 in the last 12 months. That is an annual growth rate of over four per cent. As you know, we promised at least 500,000 jobs at the last election. We have created 670,000 so far, with more to come. Over our period in office, the average growth in employment has been 2.3 per cent per annum. That is our employment rate of growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You know what the Leader of the Opposition's record was when he was Treasurer&mdash;a miserable 0.8 per cent, about one-third of our average rate of growth. In his five years in office, he created fewer jobs than we created in the last 12 months. That just shows how hopelessly inadequate the opposition was at developing employment growth. Of course, our two million jobs represent a very substantial increase in employment. When we got into office, Australia had been a nation for almost 200 years. We had a little over six million jobs. We had an additional two million in the next 12 years, which I think gives some idea of the level of that achievement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the Governor of the Reserve Bank had some thoughts on that matter. Of course, he was right. I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition entertained his caucus today by abusing the Governor of the Reserve Bank. According to the AAP reports, he spent much of his time debunking the Governor of the Reserve Bank. If the deputy thinks that is appropriate behaviour, I guess that is a measure of his standards. Of course, it does not mean that he does not rely on the governor when it suits him. He is quite happy to rely on the governor at times when he thinks the governor has said something to support him, but when the governor says something he does not like he wants to debunk the governor and rubbish him. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: if you do not want to be criticised by the Reserve Bank governor, do not talk such rubbish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to come back to taws a bit. This debate started with the Leader of the Opposition launching his so-called debt truck, which by the way broke down today in the Blue Mountains. That is indicative of the state of their argument, I would suggest. What the Leader of the Opposition said when conducting that launch was, `If it weren't for the level of foreign debt, interest rates in this country would be much lower,' and `Every Australian today who owes money on his or her home is paying a higher interest rate than would otherwise be the case because of the size of our foreign debt.' The opposition have shown in no way any capacity to prove that point. Nothing they have said indicates that there is any truth in that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank and the OECD figures show that in 1993, out of 17 countries for which interest rate data are available, five countries had higher levels of foreign debt than Australia and 11 had lower levels of foreign debt. Of those 11 countries with lower levels of foreign debt, only two&mdash;Switzerland and the United States&mdash;had lower short-term interest rates than Australia. So where is this connection between short-term interest rates, from which mortgage rates are set, and the foreign debt? Where is this connection? There has been no demonstration by the opposition in any way of any such link.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have looked at adjusting mortgage interest rates in this country in the last several years, the fact of foreign debt has simply not been an issue. When we looked at cutting interest rates after the late 1980s, did anyone&mdash;as the Reserve Bank governor asks&mdash;talk about foreign debt? No. We were not cutting interest rates because foreign debt was falling or rising. It was not an issue. It was about getting the right level of interest rates for good macro-economic outcomes. There was a whole succession of reductions in which foreign debt was never an issue. Then there were three increases last year. Was foreign debt a reason for any of that? Absolutely not. They were increased because it was seen as appropriate to take those stitches in time against inflation. That was the issue. It is about macro-economic control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the actual Australian experience of increasing short-term interest rates, from which mortgage interest rates are set, there has simply been no issue of foreign debt arising. It has not been a factor which anyone has been talking about in relation to the setting of short-term interest rates recently or, I would suggest, in any previous period. This is simply a nonsense argument that we are hearing from the opposition about a clear connection between foreign debt and mortgage interest rates. They have made the allegation, and it is up to them to prove it. They have done absolutely nothing to demonstrate that whatever.</PARA>

We are also going to halve the size of the act by rewriting the tax laws. In addition, the commissioner's tax liaison group meets regularly with top tax professionals who put issues such as compliance costs directly to the commissioner. The tax office is also working with small business to see whether there are ways in which we can lower compliance costs for small business, not only for federal government taxes but also for state taxes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Other borrowers. He was making the point that Australia's sovereign rating&mdash;that is, the rating of the Australian government&mdash;sets a ceiling above which no other borrower can go. But he said that very few others are actually affected by that. Only two of them were in the private sector, and they were multinationals. In other words, he was saying that this was not really a problem in terms of the private sector seeking to borrow overseas and being faced with a lesser rating achievement than they would be able to achieve in their own right. All of that makes quite good sense, and we certainly have no objection to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the issue about the rating of the country, he was saying that various factors go into that. Of course, they do. We all know that Australia, at AA, is not at the top rate. The top rate is AAA. There is then AA+ and AA. Of course, there are many countries around that level and many countries below that level. Many are way below the level that we are at. In deciding those ratings, the rating agencies obviously look at many factors. They look at the issues mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition in his question, such as the foreign debt issue or the current account. They also look at inflation performance, the general economic performance of the country and levels of government debt. These are all the sorts of issues which are taken into account by the rating agencies in deciding what the appropriate rating should be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding our rating, both Moody's and Standard and Poor's look at a variety of matters. Included amongst them are foreign debt and the current account. In deciding what impact that has on Australia, there is reason on the part of the opposition to have some caution in assuming that this means some tremendous increased burden on Australia in terms of higher interest rates. Obviously, the lower rating means that when the Australian government goes to borrow overseas we will be faced with some kind of premium that we would otherwise not have. The question is what the size of that premium is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the FitzGerald report, Dr FitzGerald had a list of premiums for various countries. He showed that Australia's premium was something in the order of 0.5 per cent, as I recall it. Since then, Treasury has done some further calculations to assess what the appropriate premium would be today. I notice that Dr FitzGerald said in an article the other day that the premium probably would have increased since the time of his report, but all the evidence is that it has not increased. In fact, it has reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information I have from Treasury is that if the Australian government borrowed money in America we would have to pay a higher interest rate because of our sovereign debt rating at AA. The assessment of that is that, instead of the premium being the 0.5 per cent talked about by Dr FitzGerald, it would be 0.09 per cent. The Australian government is not borrowing in America or anywhere else. We are not borrowing overseas. We have not done so since 1987. If we were to do so, that is Treasury's assessment of what the premium would be, because we have a AA rating rather than a AAA rating. It would be 0.09 per cent based on all the factors. That less than 0.1 per cent is for government borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition make some enormous leap from there to say that because there would be such a premium, albeit minuscule, there would then be some translation into mortgage interest rates, by a mechanism they still have not described, which would mean that Australian mortgage payers would be paying much more in interest rates. It is a total non sequitur. Firstly, the evidence is that the premium is extremely small in terms of the impact of our lower rating. Secondly, the step from there to saying that mortgage interest rates would be higher is one which they have not in any way shown to be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not getting anywhere in terms of this argument. Until you tell us what the link is between this and mortgage interest rates and show us that that is the case, you have no case to prove your allegation, which I say is totally and utterly false.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday I received a brief summary from the Prices Surveillance Authority of the progress the banks have made in responding to its recommendations on bank fees. The PSA will be undertaking some further analysis and continuing to have discussions with the banks. I cannot be specific to the House about what each institution has said, because the information was supplied in confidence. Of course, it is a competitive market and it is appropriate that it is supplied commercial-in-confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I can say from the information supplied to me is that it is clear that there is a move away from account keeping fees based on a minimum monthly balance. That is a very good thing because these fees impose most heavily on&mdash;in fact, they only apply to&mdash;people with small accounts, who are mostly low income earners. Ninety per cent of bank fees are accounted for by the account keeping fee. To remove that discrimination against people on low incomes is a very important development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There also appears to be a move towards the provision of a number of free transactions per month regardless of the account balance. That, of course, is also a very good step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are already a number of products with appropriate features around. The Commonwealth Bank has already announced that it is extending the exemption on all account fees to age pensioners who are already customers of that bank. What the Commonwealth had previously done was to exempt from fees pensioners who were already pensioners as of December last year. They have now extended that to any future customers of the bank, to all existing pensioners and to all new pensioners who have been customers of the bank. All Commonwealth Bank customers who become pensioners in the future will be able to be freed of fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Australia Bank already has a passbook account which offers fee free banking for all DSS recipients except for the unemployed. I understand that the unemployed are exempted from that because of the movement in and out of employment and the problems that that would create in terms of accounting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Commonwealth Bank has also moved to provide free over-the-counter service to those people with disabilities that are reliant on over-the-counter access. This is a very good thing. It was announced by the Commonwealth Bank just a few days ago. I would certainly encourage other banks to follow this example in relation to the disabled, because these people are going to have great difficulty in accessing ATMs unless they are especially designed for them, and very few of the banks have done that to this stage. If they cannot use the ATMs, they have no alternative but to go to the counter. They should receive appropriate recognition for that and get the kind of treatment that the Commonwealth Bank is now intending to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I have said before, what the government wants to see is the removal of account keeping fees based on account balances, access to a reasonable number of free transactions per month&mdash;and by that I mean more than one a week&mdash;and with some of these fee free transactions to be over-the-counter services. On the timing of all this, I expect that the banks will announce these product changes before the end of this year for implementation no later than early next year. Some banks have already indicated that they intend to make these changes before the end of this year. I would also remind the banks that I do not expect these changes to be accompanied by any overall increase in the fees charged to individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prices Surveillance Authority has also made recommendations on the treatment of inward cheque dishonours and fees on dormant accounts. The banks are generally moving towards the PSA recommendation on cheque dishonours, which was for abolition of the inward dishonoured cheque, but the reaction so far in relation to dormant accounts has been somewhat mixed. Some are moving in the right direction; others have not indicated that they are doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the banks do not appear to be responding to the PSA recommendations in a completely satisfactory manner, and I will be drawing these deficiencies to their attention. It is important to note that we are not expecting the banks to provide identical products. This is a competitive system. We can expect them to come up with different solutions to the problem that has been identified. They are generally moving in the right direction. Overall, we expect to have a good array of alternatives available for people to choose from and to provide a much more equitable system than we have had in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not get an appropriate response&mdash;I expect we will, but if it turns out not to be the case&mdash;then we do have the option of regulation. That would certainly not be our preference. I do not expect that we would have to use it but, if we have to, we will.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that the honourable member no doubt has a genuine concern about the funding for legal aid in the state of Western Australia; therefore, I will take his question in that spirit. As the House would be well aware, the Marks royal commission established by the Western Australian government is a responsibility of that government. The position of the Commonwealth has been that the costs which flow from that royal commission should be borne by the government which establishes it. That, of course, is the principle that the Commonwealth applies in terms of commissions of inquiry which it establishes and which state governments have also followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member mentioned the question of challenges to the commission, implying that a different set of rules somehow should apply. Obviously they did not apply to the New South Wales Liberal government of John Fahey, who funded former Premier Nick Greiner to challenge in the New South Wales Supreme Court the finding of the Independent Commission Against Corruption against Mr Greiner. Nor did it apply to the Groom government in Tasmania, which funded the challenge by former Liberal Premier Robin Gray to the proceedings of the Rouse royal commission in Tasmania. And that same rule should apply obviously to the Western Australian government. It is only upon the failure of the Western Australian government to meet its responsibilities that the Commonwealth government will become involved in the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member mentioned the number of unsuccessful legal aid applications in Western Australia in the previous financial year. I note his concern about this. If he has a concern about the level of funding for legal aid in Western Australia, I ask the honourable member to note that the amount spent by the Western Australian government on its absolutely futile and never-having-any-chance-at-all challenge to the native title legislation, together with the cost to the Western Australian taxpayers of the Marks royal commission, will exceed in this year the amount which the Western Australian government commits to legal aid in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, for its part, recognises that legal aid requires additional funding. That is why in March of this year the Prime Minister announced as part of the Justice Statement a $24 million increase in legal aid. That money in proportion will flow to Western Australia. It will flow to the constituents he has mentioned. That money is earmarked to go to family law and civil law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are really concerned about legal aid applicants in Western Australia missing out on funding, then direct to the government of Western Australia your concern about its futile use of taxpayers' money in challenging in the High Court the native title legislation and its setting up of the witch-hunt, the Marks royal commission.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Moreton for his question and continuing interest in the tourism industry, particularly the Queensland tourism industry. It is an industry that last year generated more than $12,000 million in export earnings for Australia. This industry has boosted in the last decade or more the number of international visitors coming to Australia from less than one million a year to 3.5 million in the 12 months to July this year. Last Friday the latest figures came through. I was extremely pleased that the Australian Bureau of Statistics found for July this year a 17 per cent increase in the number of international visitors coming to Australia compared with July last year. The figures that really gladdened my soul were the ones showing a massive rebound in the number of Japanese tourists coming to Australia in July this year. The figures show an 18 per cent increase in the number of Japanese coming to Australia in July this year compared with July last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am so pleased about this is that a few media reports, particularly in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, have suggested that Japanese interest in holidaying in Australia was fading. No doubt both sides of the House were concerned about the impact that the Kobe earthquake might have had on Japanese travel, and there has been a bit of a shake in the economic confidence in Japan with the rise in the value of the yen. I am very pleased that we are seeing the new Kansai airport coming on line and the fact that Qantas and Ansett are now flying directly between Kansai and Australia reflected in the massive increases in the figures released last Friday. I have also been informed by my department that we can expect this dramatic improvement to continue, given that the visa approvals in Japan for holidays in Australia were up 25 per cent for July and up a further 12 per cent in August.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are more people choosing to holiday in Australia but also all the statistics show that, when people come to Australia, they spend more money during their holiday. The figures show that even if you exclude the cost of the air fare the average tourist from another country holidaying in Australia spends $1,886 during their holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued to look at the hit parade concerning which visitors from which country spend the most and which spend the least. You might be surprised, Mr Speaker, to learn that it is the Indonesians these days&mdash;all 106,000 of them who came to Australia last year&mdash;who are the biggest spenders, spending $3,378 on average during their visits. The country whose visitors spent least per day was Britain. The British spent $43 each day. It would be wrong to conclude that the Poms have long pockets, because they tend to stay longer in Australia than people from other countries. They stay an average of 45 days. I understand that many of these English visitors are family and friends of the member for Fowler and that he is in part responsible for many of the English visitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I launched the Australian Tourist Commission advertising campaign in Asia. This advertising campaign will see $100 million spent over the next three years in promoting Australia as a tourism destination. We will be running advertisements in Europe, America, Japan and Asia and we will be attracting more and more visitors to Australia through this campaign. I know that the member for Moreton would be interested to know that some of those advertisements will be run under the Partnership Australia campaign. I think most of the state and territory tourist commissions are involved. In particular, the QTTC will be working in partnership with the Australian Tourist Commission in attracting as many visitors as possible to some of the parts of Australia that the member for Moreton would like them to visit&mdash;perhaps the theme parks in south-east Queensland. I know that the member for Herbert would like them to be visiting Townsville and points north.</PARA>

As I talk about the noise burden I should take the opportunity, in the context of responding to that question, to remind the House of the genesis of the problem that many people now suffer. That genesis lies in the decision that was taken in 1989 regarding the construction of the new runway at Sydney airport. I find, and I think honourable members in the House would all find, very instructive an article that was written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 13 December 1994 by Mr Laurie Oakes.

<PARA>says Oakes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original proposal was supposed to be that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than over houses. Clever Keating&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">changed that and sent them roaring over suburbia. The east-west runway was supposed to continue operating, but it was Keating who killed that idea too and ensured that all planes operated over the north-south axis.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the genesis of the enormous mess we now have, which is the operation of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. By introducing that private member's bill, after 12 1/2 years of the government doing nothing, after 12 1/2 years of it being absolutely indifferent to the interests of the residents of Sydney, after that kind of factional political manipulation that I have just described as being engaged in by the Prime Minister, the opposition has done two things. It has forced the government to acknowledge the need to entrench into law the curfew arrangements at Sydney airport and, therefore, to provide a modicum of assurance and protection to people who now live under the north-south flight path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, by introducing that bill I have given those people opposite an opportunity to vote in favour of the reopening of the east-west runway.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition the most thundering cant and hypocrisy. I am glad, in answering the honourable member's question, that he sought to rely upon a 1989 article. Let me rely on a couple of 1989 quotes which mention the significance of Sydney to the tourism industry. One J.W. Howard told Mike Carlton on radio 2GB:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I grew up under the flight path in the St George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of that area, and I've always regarded the issue&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of aircraft noise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents.</PARA>
<PARA>What hypocrisy! He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a limited number of people who are severely affected by aircraft noise. The great bulk of the rest of them are only mildly affected. In any event, they bought their houses knowing full well that they were under flight paths. In any event, there are many sections of my electorate in areas such as Lane Cove and Hunters Hill who have just as much aircraft noise and areas frequently under flight paths as people living near the airport.</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition was not content to make his call for the third runway in Sydney simply on the Mike Carlton show. He rocked along to see Vince Smith after that and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the political impact of building a third runway in terms of the people under the flight path reacting adversely has been grossly exaggerated. I have never thought that was a problem. I mean, Vincent, I grew up in one of the areas covered by the flight path and I know some of the local politics and I think it has been grossly exaggerated over the years and I think more and more people see the issue in terms of being. . . in Sydney's interests being scarified and more importantly nationally, the tourist industry being prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA>Talk about saying one thing in one place and another to an audience! You do not reckon he has been flinging these quotes around the good citizens of Sydney who have been attending all of those demonstrations to say what his attitude was, do you? You do not think he has been saying one thing in this place and might have been saying another thing in another place, do you? How could that possibly be so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the very great significance of reopening this east-west runway. Let us have the two parallel lines of aircraft coming in and let us just rock a couple of aircraft straight across in front of them. That is a good idea&mdash;really brilliant! That is a great thing to do! He says that his bill is so essential and that he is very proud of his bill&mdash;a bill which is not being discussed by the House. He implies that somehow or other their problems are going to be fixed up by that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere in that bill is there any mention of opening that runway. All that there is in your bill is an enshrining of the regulations that this government put in place over those 12 1/2 years, and an enforcing of them. That is what this government has been doing.

That is what they were saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, there is one variant of that third runway&mdash;which would be a variant you could be absolutely certain that they would in the end approve&mdash;that is, the notion of taking propeller-driven aircraft across that third runway, out on the stub of that third runway, out over the suburbs to the east and west of Sydney airport. What effect would that have on the people suffering under the flight paths of the two north-south parallel runways? It would increase the capacity to put jumbos into the air by 10 jumbos an hour. John Howard's proposition amounts to a capacity to put through the north-south runways, by taking the propeller-driven aircraft off those runways, another 10 jumbos an hour&mdash;increasing it across those sections of the public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debt truck which was launched by the coalition last week conveys a stark message to Australians on what will be the lasting legacy of this government of debt and deficit. Driving around with the burden of debt on its back, I hear you say, would break down any truck in Australia. In fact, the only great surprise is that the legacy of debt did not break down on the road when it was going around the marginal seats of Australia today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lasting legacy of this government will be the legacy of debt and deficit. There is really only one factor that one need get one's mind around when thinking about the legacy of debt that this government has built up. That is, when it came to office in 1983 the foreign debt of Australia was $23 billion in net terms; 12 years later, it is $180 billion. The rest of the statistics are essentially designed by the government to obscure its failure in relation to foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 12 years of the reckless financial mismanagement of this Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his role as both Prime Minister and Treasurer, this country's debt in net terms has gone from $23 billion to $180 billion. It is a debt which has been built up not only for this generation of Australians but also for the generations of Australians to follow. It is an eightfold increase over 12 years, an 800 per cent increase during the management and stewardship of this man as Prime Minister and Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to laugh when we hear the government quibbling about some of the percentages it likes to talk about, percentages that it hopes will increase savings by 1.7 per cent, or whatever, by 2020. A 1.7 per cent increase in savings is its current answer to an 800 per cent increase in foreign debt over the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt truck, which is going around Australia and showing Australian people the magnitude of the financial recklessness of this government, not only displays the debt that this government has recklessly built up but also displays the interest rates and the interest costs in relation to that. It displays how that interest is ticking over bit by bit&mdash;$8 billion over the course of this year. It displays how $1 million an hour is built up in the debt which this government has allowed to develop like a monkey on the back of the Australian economy. You often hear some of the super models saying they will not get out of bed except for $10,000, but no Australian gets out of bed except for $8 million of interest which is paid on foreign debt as it ticks over hour by hour, day by day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia today is staggering under the load of foreign debt. What concerns us is that we wake up a miscreant Prime Minister to the load he has inflicted upon the Australian economy and a country that is staggering under the load of foreign debt which threatens to break that country and impose on ordinary Australians some of the pressures that this government has allowed to build up. We are concerned that that message is brought home to them before in fact the full amplitude of its effects are known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to break down the financial pressures which have been building up on families who have to pay higher interest rates in relation to their businesses and their mortgages as a consequence of the reckless financial mismanagement of this government. We want to make sure that we can break down for Australia a policy of this government which has been to put the country into hock in relation to debt and foreign equity, because that has been the policy of this government over the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of this government reached its absolute high point in terms of political deceit when the Treasurer (Mr Willis), obviously stung by this debt truck, obviously stung by this debt trap in relation to where he has put the country, went on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program on Thursday of last week and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second point is that the foreign debt means higher interest rates for Australians on their mortgages. That is completely and utterly untrue. There's not one skerrick of truth in that point.</PARA>
<PARA>I will tell you where there was not one skerrick of truth: there was not one skerrick of truth in that claim. I noticed today, when you were given the opportunity to repeat the claim, you went into this burden of proof type argument, that it is now just a question of a burden of proof. But the fact is that the proposition you put forward has been utterly discredited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the case says that foreign debt has no domestic consequences for interest rates, why do you not blow the foreign debt higher? Why would there be any argument that we should contain the foreign debt if the position of your government is that it does not matter and it does not have any effect? As of today you have not one reputable source backing your position, your outlandish claim on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program of last Thursday. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> today, Professor Warwick McKibbin said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any country that has a large debt tends to pay a premium over the risk-free range.</PARA>
<PARA>If you cannot get Chris Caton to support you, you are really down to your last supporter. Chris Caton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's quite clear that the current-account deficit at 6 per cent of GDP [gross domestic product] has an impact on long-term rates, but beyond that it gets difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some circumstances there could be some effect . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Tom Valentine, the Dean of Commerce at the University of Western Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course the debt has an impact . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This causes higher mortgage rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I'm amazed there is even debate about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course there would not be a debate about this issue except for the irresponsibility of this government, which you cannot face up to. The government's own financial savings adviser, Vince FitzGerald, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think it's even controversial there is a risk premium in our whole interest rate structure relating to the high level of foreign debt. The only issue is about how big it is.</PARA>
<PARA>You cannot pull out one reputable source to back your argument. May I say, you cannot even pull out one disreputable source to back your argument, because the Prime Minister even disagrees with you. The day before you made that claim, at the Agribusiness Association seminar in Orange the Prime Minister said, `We must work to deal with the problem so we are not paying too high a premium on world interest rates.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot pull out a reputable source. You cannot pull out a disreputable source. You are at war with your own budget papers which, when you brought them down this year, noted that a high level of foreign borrowing relative to GDP can impose costs on an economy by making it more vulnerable to external shocks and by raising interest rate premiums on borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are even at odds with yourself on this issue. You are at odds with your own savings adviser. You are at odds with your own Prime Minister. Yesterday your Prime Minister was given the opportunity to come in and say that he agreed with you, and he denied you twice. He would not back you up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In question time today, the government was down to its last gasp because here it was trying to quote Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, on the topic. Even the Governor of the Reserve Bank came out with a mixed message. If the Governor of the Reserve Bank came out with a mixed message, you cannot even claim him as a defender on this issue. I remind you what the Prime Minister said in December 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[I have] Treasury in my pocket, the Reserve Bank in my pocket, wages policy in my pocket, the financial community . . . both here and overseas, in my pocket.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no coincidence that in Australia bank prime rates are the highest in the industrialised world and no coincidence that Australia has the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world. It is no coincidence that Standard and Poor's is reporting on the parlous situation of the Australian economy. As Graham Lee, the managing director of rating services for Standard and Poor's, has said, it is not just the case that we are the worst in the OECD; it is not just the case that we are the worst amongst the industrialised nations; we are the near worst amongst all of the nations that Standard and Poor's actually rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lee revealed that, out of the 51 countries that Standard and Poor's rated, Australia came in 49th&mdash;that is, 49th out of 51. Before the government goes on with all of its statistics in relation to external debt to exports, I point out that Mr Lee revealed that, out of the 51 countries of the world that Standard and Poor's rates in terms of external debt to exports, Australia came in 47th&mdash;that is, 47th out of 51. Think about it. As the Prime Minister says, we are a country with probably the richest resources in the world. Where are we coming in the international league ladder? We are coming 49th and 47th out of 51. The government can try to run and it can try to hide, but, at the end of day, the reality is that it is average Australians who pay for this recklessness in financial management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next excuse that the government has tried to drum into its backbench is that it is not their fault and it is the fault of the private sector, yet Vince FitzGerald, the government's own savings adviser, advised them in his report on savings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the foreign debt position of Australia, and for that matter the current account deficit . . . are attributable only to a small extent if at all to private sector net borrowing; rather they are essentially attributable to government . . .</PARA>
<PARA>You have gone out there and tripled government debt over the last four years. It is the government that gets into the domestic market and soaks up the savings in the domestic market and forces the private borrowers offshore. As a result, as Vince FitzGerald has said quite plainly and quite truthfully, it is the government's fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister turned columnist today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and various other newspapers. I want to read this to the Treasurer because when I put this proposition to him today, and when he was asked about it in question time, he described the Prime Minister's own view as ludicrous and absurd. The Prime Minister said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that if the Government runs deficits and has to borrow in the marketplace it displaces other private borrowings, which are then satisfied offshore.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an admission from the Prime Minister himself which is in today's press. If you want to come into this House and say that this is ludicrous or absurd, as you did in answer to that question, you are quibbling with your own Prime Minister. You cannot even get a disreputable source to back you on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the Prime Minister also say? The second excuse that came out in relation to this issue is that it is the fault of private savings. It is partially the fault of private savings, but who is responsible for the fact that our housing savings ratio in September was the lowest on record? Do you know who he says is responsible? He says that it is the fault of John W. Howard 12 years ago. This man is caught in a time warp where anything bad that happens subsequently has nothing to do with the person who had the Treasury in his pocket, the Reserve Bank in his pocket and the wages policy in his pocket. He cannot face reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that part of the Prime Minister's problem is that he does not have a credible argument in relation to this matter. Glenn Milne disclosed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 14 August 1995 how caucus was worried about the current account and foreign debt. The Prime Minister got up and explained to caucus. The member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) said to the Prime Minister, `Why can't you give us notes to actually encapsulate that in writing?' There was an ominous silence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They came back again, as Glenn Milne records, `Why can't you give us the notes that convinced us all it was not a problem?' There was an ominous silence. As Glenn Milne said, those present at the meeting believed Willis was signalling that it would have been dangerous for Keating to give his imprimatur because the officials were in dispute over the matter and Treasury would not sign off on this explanation that the Prime Minister had given to the caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that it may be easy to convince your caucus&mdash;it may be easy to pull the wool over their eyes&mdash;but when it comes to pulling the wool over the economists' eyes you have struck out. When it comes to arguing with your own budget papers you have struck out. When it comes to Vince FitzGerald you have struck out. When it comes to explaining this to the people of Australia who know that the debt position you have created is affecting their country and is affecting their financial position you will, in due course, strike out as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the quarter of an hour that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) had to explain his continued assertion, and that of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), that there is a direct link between foreign debt and the interest rates that people of Australia are paying on their mortgages, he did not explain how that link works. He cannot explain it. He simply made that allegation. The Leader of the Opposition made that allegation when launching his lorry of lies out the front. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it weren't for the level of foreign debt, interest rates in this country would be much lower, and every Australian today who owes money on his or her home is paying a higher interest rate than would otherwise be the case because of the size of our foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>When he said that, he had no justification for saying it. He still has no justification for saying it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a speech for a quarter of an hour and there was not one word of explanation. There was not a word to explain how it all works. He was just saying, `This is my allegation and there are a couple of people that I can mention who think I might be right.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the person in charge of monetary policy in this country says that you are not right, so start off with that point. The person who is actually in charge of monetary policy, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, says that the debt is a minor issue at best in terms of domestic interest rates in this country and that the issues being pursued by the opposition are totally out of the field. It is just not true to say that there is any sensible link between foreign debt and mortgage interest rates. That proposition, if it is going to be alleged, ought to be justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make the point again: the fact is that mortgage interest rates are set on the basis of the short-term official interest rates. They are a margin above that. The short-term official interest rates are set not by market but by the Reserve Bank in conjunction with the government. The Reserve Bank has made&mdash;certainly whilst I have been Treasurer&mdash;the initiative for any particular change of monetary policy. We accepted what they proposed in relation to the three increases last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three increases had nothing whatever to do with foreign debt. There was not one skerrick of a mention of foreign debt. It was due to the fact that we were moving interest rates up because we believed it was important for us to take the step to put a stitch in time against inflation as the economy, having had a relatively long period of growth, was likely to develop some inflationary forces unless some action was taken with monetary policy, which had been eased enormously since the late 1980s. Again, those easings had nothing to do with foreign debt. In looking at those monetary policy settings last year, the action taken to increase interest rates was because of the need to take some anti-inflationary action. It was not anything to do with foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The margins that are set for mortgage rates are based on the official rate which has been determined by official action which is in turn aimed at inflation or at macro-economic outcomes. The reductions which occurred&mdash;the whole stream of them from the late 1980s&mdash;were about trying to get the economy back onto a growth path. The increases were about trying to restrain inflation. None of them had anything to do, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank said, with the level of foreign debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said that none of those increases had anything to do with foreign debt. He said that none of those reductions had anything to do with foreign debt. It is quite clear that the setting of short-term interest rates in this country is determined not on the basis of foreign debt but on the basis of macro-economic stability. The mortgage rates that feed off them are therefore related to those factors and are not related to foreign debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that foreign debt has no impact at all on any interest rate. As I said at question time&mdash;and I said it last Thursday&mdash;if the government is going to borrow overseas, then clearly, if it has a lower rating than it might have had previously, there is a higher premium to pay in terms of the interest rate that will be required to make the appropriate borrowings. I have made that point. That is quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that there are two points. Firstly, how big is that premium? I said something about that at question time today. The second point is: how does that translate into a mortgage rate which is being set on the basis of official interest rates&mdash;which are not being determined on the basis of foreign debt but are being set on the basis of macro-economic stability? That is the process. What is this link? The member for Higgins had a quarter of an hour to make his speech and show a link, and he had no idea what the link was. He had no idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, as I demonstrated at question time, if the opposition want to say that there is some kind of a link then it is absolutely incumbent upon them to demonstrate that there is a link. If they are going to say to the Australian people, `You are paying more in interest rates because of foreign debt,' they should be able to prove that charge. They simply cannot show how it works. They cannot show how it works because it does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the issue, as I said, of the size of any premium that we would pay. The size of that premium, as referred to by Dr FitzGerald in his report on savings, was about 0.5 per cent. As I said at question time, the Treasury has done further work on that and reckons, from its calculations, that the premium is now more like 0.09 per cent, less than 0.1 per cent. That is what they see as the difference in terms of borrowings in overseas markets at AA instead of AAA. That is the relevance of foreign debt in terms of the rating and therefore the additional premium we have to pay because of a lower rating. It is a minuscule amount on government borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, according to the opposition, this flows back into the Australian economy in some way they have not explained, reflects itself in mortgage interest rates and leads to the outcome which the Leader of the Opposition says means that people are paying much higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case. How can he possibly justify a claim of that kind when the premium is so small and he cannot even show how it flows back into the domestic economy, let alone into interest rates for mortgages, which is where he made his claim?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absurd for the opposition to be going around with their truck trying to demonstrate to the Australian people that there is a link when they cannot possibly show that there is a link and when the premium that we pay because of a lower rating because of foreign debt is so small and you cannot see how it comes back onto mortgage interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted that last Friday a couple of economists in the market commented on this. For instance, the Bankers Trust's senior economist, Rory Robertson, said that the level of foreign debt had close enough to no influence on variable housing rates. The National Australia Bank chief economist, Mr Allan Oster, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is easier to argue Mr Willis's case than the coalition's, but there are a couple of issues which made Mr Willis only about 80 per cent right. If Australia's high foreign debt put downward pressure on  the Australian dollar, the threat of higher inflation could force the Reserve Bank to lift interest rates, leading banks to raise their variable mortgage rates.</PARA>
<PARA>We have not faced that situation. We have had variations in the dollar&mdash;that is for sure&mdash;but we have not been adjusting interest rates to offset that inflationary factor, so you cannot point to that kind of flow through as a factor in pushing up interest rates in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that if you look at other countries, at the level of foreign debt and the level of short-term interest rates, you simply cannot see any relation. As I said at question time, there is no demonstrable relationship that you can show. Of those countries that had lower foreign debt than we do, only two had lower short-term interest rates&mdash;only two. Where is the relationship between foreign debt and short-term interest rates, from which the mortgage rates are set, if it is as the opposition says&mdash;that there is such a relationship? You cannot see it, looking at other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just another example of the determination of this opposition&mdash;this policy free opposition, this opposition which simply has no policies&mdash;to say nothing to the Australian people about what it stands for. It simply wants to bag the government all the time&mdash;bag a government which is doing much better than most other Western countries in terms of the fundamentals that matter to the Australian people. The government is doing much better in terms of building up the level of growth in this country, producing growth at the top levels of countries in the Western developed world, producing employment growth at the top levels of Western industrialised countries&mdash;and doing it in the context of low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are terrific outcomes. These are the sorts of outcomes that John Howard would have given his right arm for when he was Treasurer of this country, because he could not produce anything like that. He had growth of one per cent per annum less than we have had. He had employment growth of only one-third of the rate that we have had. He had inflation which on average was much higher than&mdash;almost double&mdash;what we have had. He left this country with double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and the worst recession for 50 years at that stage&mdash;now, going on from there, for 60 years. The worst recession, the deepest recession, we have had since the 1930s occurred when John Howard, the now Leader of the Opposition, was Treasurer. That is the kind of comparison that we can make with the previous government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has much to be proud of for what it has been able to achieve in terms of growth, employment, improvement of real incomes and low inflation. These are terrific outcomes compared with the standards of effort by the previous government. Of course, that has all been accompanied by a massive structural change to the Australian economy in a way which is very beneficial for our future prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly it has been accompanied by an increase in foreign debt. We do not deny that. There has been an increase in foreign debt. But it is part of the internationalisation of the Australian economy and the fact that Australian businesses have borrowed, as the budget papers say, in substantial part, to invest overseas. Australian investment overseas by companies has gone up from 10 per cent of GDP to virtually 30 per cent of GDP, a point made in the budget papers. It has been facilitated by foreign borrowing by those companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a bad thing for the Australian people if the borrowings are offset by assets, and there are substantial assets against them. Whether they are here or overseas does not matter much as long as they are productive assets and produce an income stream which comes back to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking just at the debt and not at the assets is absurd. You have to look at the whole scene. The opposition line that there is $10,000 of debt for every Australian person is a scaremongering tactic. You have to look at all the assets that sit against that. The World Bank says that we have got $1 million of assets per person in Australia. You can put your $10,000 against the $1 million of assets for each Australian. That perhaps gets it in some kind of better perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in relation to the allegation that the budget papers support the opposition, the budget papers do no such thing. The Budget Statements say at page 2-36:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a high level of foreign borrowing relative to GDP can impose costs on an economy by making it more vulnerable to external shocks and by raising interest rate premia on borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to borrowings overseas, that is clear. I have already said that. That is what happens. But the premium is very small. We do not have to say that that represents an increase in mortgage interest rates because of higher foreign debt. It simply does not follow. The budget papers do not say that, and there is just no reason to believe that there is any support for the opposition's case in what is in the budget papers. The budget papers make it clear that the increase in foreign debt has assets against it, and that is a very important matter for the Australian people to bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, our level of foreign debt is certainly not the highest in the Western industrialised world. Two very comparable countries&mdash;New Zealand and Canada&mdash;have higher foreign debt as a proportion of GDP than we do. To simply say that the Australian people are bearing a higher interest rate because of foreign debt is a total non sequitur when you notice that the level of interest rates in general in New Zealand has been less than ours, despite the fact that their foreign debt has been much higher. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found great interest in listening to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) today. It has been fascinating to see where he has moved across the board. I found it interesting to hear him quote from page 2-36 of the budget statements:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a high level of foreign borrowing relative to GDP can impose costs on an economy by making it more vulnerable to external shocks and by raising interest rate premia on borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fairly clear. He goes out and quotes the darned thing himself. It amazes me that he does so. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says in his article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that if the Government runs deficits and has to borrow in the marketplace it displaces other private borrowings, which are then satisfied offshore.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fascinating to hear the Treasurer say, `But these are very small effects.' While the effects that we have by virtue of the magnitude of changes in this economy can be determined as being very small, their implications can be fairly major. Let me quote what Tom Valentine, Dean of Commerce at the University of Western Sydney and an authority on monetary policy, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course the debt has an impact. In order to borrow offshore there has to be a premium on interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This causes higher mortgage rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I'm amazed there is even debate about this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>A couple of minutes ago the Treasurer was in here trying to say to us, `There aren't people of authority backing up your statements.' It is absolutely ridiculous. Dr Vince FitzGerald, the government's savings adviser, said in his 1993 report to the government on national savings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we need to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the risks inherent in our high external debt.</PARA>
<PARA>He also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . while it is true that some sections of the Australian community&mdash;for example, households&mdash;have not greatly increased their debt, to an important extent we are all in the same boat. Foreign financiers, in rating sovereign debt, correctly see the various sectors of the domestic sector as linked.</PARA>
<PARA>I go on to Chris Caton, Chief Economist at Bankers Trust, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's quite clear that the current account deficit at 6 per cent of GDP . . . has an impact on long-term rates, but beyond that it gets difficult.</PARA>
<PARA>But the fact is that he acknowledges its impact. Professor Warwick McKibbin of the ANU says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any country that has a large debt tends to pay a premium over the risk-free range . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we pay a risk premium for a whole range of factors, including the variability of our monetary policy compared to, say, New Zealand's.</PARA>
<PARA>We accept that. He acknowledges the fact that the more we have in foreign debt the greater implications that has for the cost of money in this country. Let me go to the OECD's report on Australia that was released in June this year. Once again, I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The widening current external debt&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is what leads to the higher foreign debt, in case anybody has any concerns about that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[exerts] significant upward pressure on Australian real long term interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>These are people in our community that the Treasurer was trying to say to us a few minutes ago that we have not got. He trots out on a regular basis his mate, the Governor from the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a look at Commonwealth debt, it is significant that over the last four years we have had an increase of some $60 billion. The government argues that these funds are not borrowed from overseas; they are government funds that are borrowed locally. But the Chief Economist from the National Australia Bank, Allan Ostler, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government is funding a lot domestically, it's basically driving companies offshore. It's a crowding-out effect.</PARA>
<PARA>With respect to foreign debt, Mr Ostler says that foreign debt can influence short-term interest rates through the premium required to cover exchange rate risk in overseas lending, and the possible risk of inflation if the dollar falls. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all mortgages are variable these days, some are fixed for one or two or five years. Debt and risk premium have a direct effect on these.</PARA>
<PARA>These quotes highlight the fact that in this debate all we are hearing from the Treasurer is smoke and mirrors. I find it interesting that the Prime Minister in his article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has tried to relate this nation to a household. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this sense, the nation is like a household. Householders very often borrow not from their own savings but from someone else's to build an asset for themselves which, over time, they devote to their income for servicing.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fine, and in fact often we do borrow. If I owed $23 billion in 1983 and I owe $180 billion now in 1995&mdash;12 years later it is almost eight times the original amount&mdash;I think my bank manager would be calling me in for a chat. In fact, that is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our international debt rating has been reduced by companies such as Standard and Poor's and Moody's. In 1986 they downgraded the AAA rating to AA1, with a further downgrade in 1989 to AA2. I refer to the speech by Mr Lee, managing director of ratings services for Standard and Poor's, to the Australian Financial Markets Association. Mr Lee said Australia's foreign debt and current account deficit are the two areas that `stand out as unfavourable features of Australia's overall creditworthiness' and `place Australia in a position where it is much more susceptible to international trends and preferences, and they restrict flexibility in economic management'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also revealed that Australia ranked 47 out of the 51 countries that it assessed in terms of external debt to exports in 1994-95. The Prime Minister in his article today also went on to talk about the importance of getting our exports up and about how well we are going in this area. He talked about the doubling of exports into our Asian countries in APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have doubled our exports since 1985. The only problem is that in the same period the imports to those countries have trebled. As a result of that, we now have only three per cent of our exports accounting for imports into APEC as opposed to four per cent some 10 years ago. In dollar terms, that is $9 billion worth of exports that we have fallen behind. So don't talk about competitiveness&mdash;in relation to that part of the world we are actually falling behind in our competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the comments that were made by the Treasurer with respect to the research that was done on the richest nations which estimated that Australia has a net worth of $US835,000 per head of population and the concern of this government that we in the opposition have been talking about the $10,000 per head of population of debt that we owe if you take it across the community. It is a damning statement that we are seen as the richest country in the world, but what are we doing with it? If we had a decent government&mdash;this government has been around for 13-odd years&mdash;we would actually be putting some of these resources which make us the richest country of the world into some use so that, in world terms, we are seen as being substantially in a better position than we are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk about all of these areas where we are headed as a country and you talk about foreign debt. Part of the problem with the level of foreign debt that we have in this country, which affects our interest rates, is that the members of this government have not got off their backsides to sort out some of the policies necessary to get some of those reserves that are sitting in our soil into production in this country, which would get our people back working in this work force. This government has sat on its laurels and now wants to start to talk about what it is doing for this country. All it is is mirrors and smokescreens&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this matter of public importance to again go through what has been a trumped up process run by the opposition on the issue of debt. Last week, the opposition launched the lorry of lies&mdash;what is now a broken down truck&mdash;which contained a load of garbage in terms of the assertions made by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim being made at that stage was that for every Australian man, woman and child there is a $10,000 debt. Bills purporting to represent that debt have been sent out in many electorates. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was challenged about this last week when the truck was outside Parliament House, he said, `No, I do not really mean that. That is not quite what I mean. I am suggesting that there is a link between the levels of foreign debt and mortgage interest rates.' Since then there has been a lot of discussion. The opposition is gradually moving away from that and is attempting to say something different. If we wait long enough, no doubt it will be able to come up with a consistent approach to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the question of mortgage interest rates first. The government has established through its discussions&mdash;both in the lead-up to the budget and in matters since then, when we have talked about the current account and debt&mdash;the need to develop short- and medium-term strategies to meet our current account problem and, in turn, to take appropriate strategies to deal with the debt issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put the issue into proper context rather than engage and indulge in a scare campaign which the opposition hopes might substitute for a policy, but it will not. Today the debt servicing ratio that the country has to meet is 11 per cent. In 1983 it was nine per cent. It has turned around in the last few years as the economy has changed. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank said yesterday, there have been 15 movements in official rates over the last four to five years. On none of those occasions was the claim made that there was a link between mortgage interest rates and foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the movements in official interest rates involved the broader monetary policy consideration and the overall management of the economy and were to kick-start the economy out of the recession and to ensure that we had a sustainable level of growth. The 16th quarter of growth has ticked over in Australia. The opposition keeps trying to run this charge about foreign debt when the economy is achieving world standards in growth&mdash;16 quarters of growth. There is every prospect that that will continue in a sustained way. The government is achieving something that the opposition never could when it had custody of the Treasury: no boom-bust cycle that Australian economies have historically gone through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will achieve that. That has been made clear by the 16 quarters of growth and the fact that our short-term interest rates are very competitive internationally. People make league table claims about who is better than whom on all these issues. It is quite appropriate to point out that, as far as a link between foreign debt and short-term interest rates is concerned, we are in a very competitive position. We are amongst the best of all the OECD countries in terms of short-term interest rates. Even if it were possible to establish this axiomatic linkage between mortgage interest rates and debt&mdash;and the charge has not been sustained anyway&mdash;it has been shown that government strategies have, in the management of short-term interest rates, achieved that objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have a sensible discussion about these issues we need to go back a step or two and look at the current account, the statement the Treasurer (Mr Willis) released on the medium-term budget strategy earlier this year, the action that was taken in the budget and the savings strategy the government has put in place. People have quoted Vince FitzGerald and others on this issue but no-one has disputed the strategies the government has established in order to achieve a budget surplus this year&mdash;the first budget surplus since the recession and only the fourth budget surplus in 30 years; all achieved by Labor governments&mdash;a stronger budget structural surplus next year and a comprehensive strategy to increase the level of national savings. These are the things that ensure that we deal with the current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget forecast this year makes clear that our current account position will improve through 1995-96. The Treasurer made clear last Thursday in question time that he thinks we will do better than the budget time forecast because the economy has achieved both the soft landing and sustainable level of growth that we saw as critical at the time of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, we outlined a major enhancement of the national savings strategy through superannuation. That has been a feature of this government. Bear in mind that, when we came into government, 40 per cent of people had superannuation. In the last quarter, we had superannuation investment assets of $198 billion. That figure was released by the Statistician last Thursday. How has that been achieved? It has been achieved through the superannuation guarantee, the savings strategy the government established over the last few years. That superannuation savings strategy is already providing a contribution of a half per cent of GDP and over the next few years it will rise to two per cent of GDP. That is how substantial the budget superannuation initiatives are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have discussions about the current account, we indicate that the magnitude of percentage of GDP which we need to satisfy our current account, and, therefore, to take the further steps to stabilise our foreign debt position, is a quota of about 1 1/2 per cent of GDP. The superannuation savings strategy will add two per cent of GDP per annum. So let us not kid ourselves that there is not a strategy to deal with this issue. The Australian community should be reassured that the government has a firm strategy to meet the current account problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the issue of what this foreign debt represents. We have not had any sensible discussion about what the debt represents from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) or the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) who have contributed to this MPI. Investment in this country has grown dramatically in the last couple of years. It has grown to proportions that the opposition said at budget time in 1994 and 1995 were unsustainable. When we forecast the figure of 14 1/2 per cent in 1994, the opposition said that it would never be achieved. In fact, we have achieved 25 per cent. In relation to this year's forecast, we had claims from the opposition that the economy was going into a double-dip recession. That was as recently as three or four months ago. What a nonsense that looks like today. It is the same nonsense we are now getting about foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies have been borrowing from overseas to finance business investment. Much of the investment has been in Australia, but not all of it. Why is that? It is partly because we have tried to globalise the economy. If a major bank or another institution in Australia thinks there is value in having at least part of their investment strategy in offshore arrangements, that is something that reflects well on the overall maturity and the depth of our economy. What does investment here and abroad mean? It means more economic activity, more jobs and a more sustainable livelihood for all Australians. That is what we should be concerned about, because that is what, in part, this private sector debt&mdash;over 60 per cent of the foreign debt&mdash;is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point to make about any level of debt is the capacity to service it. What we are getting in the 1990s, unlike the situation of the past, is companies making sustained long-term capital investment, reinvesting to provide those long-term opportunities in Australia, and at the same time ensuring that the nation gains a significant improvement in national wealth as a result of it. We should not be saying that all foreign debt is bad or that the government does not have the strategy to effectively manage the servicing of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the government and the private sector are ensuring that that happens. We are ensuring that there is a sustainable level of economic growth, and we are particularly building upon the strong achievements of our superannuation savings strategy to ensure that we meet the current account challenge and achieve what we have not been able to achieve before&mdash;sustainable levels of national savings, sustainable levels of growth, sustainable levels of improvement in employment&mdash;and doing it on a low inflation base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are things that the opposition could not achieve when it was in government. Rather than coming in with this sort of knocking scare campaign aimed at the Australian people for cheap electoral purposes, the opposition, if they do not agree with this strategy, should be saying what their alternative is to deal with this issue rather than running around the country with this lorry of lies, the garbage truck which offers nothing in public policy terms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was asked a question by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) about what the opposition is going to do with its bill. The stunt was exposed when the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) answered a question which I asked about the real attitude of the member for Bennelong. The best example of the hypocrisy of the opposition and the backfiring of the stunt was the look on the face of the member for Warringah. This was a stunt that blew up in the opposition's face. The Leader of the Opposition's private member's bill on this issue is a stunt that will blow up in his face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With his amendments to the government's bill, the Leader of the Opposition has admitted that the reason why he introduced his private member's bill was to reopen the east-west runway. He submitted his private member's bill on the pretext of strengthening the curfew arrangements. However, we only have to look at the second reading amendment that he has proposed today to see that that was just a sideshow. His real aim was to reopen the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition did not put that in his bill originally because, as the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) stated today, he did not want the Morris committee to put the east-west runway proposal under scrutiny and expose it for the short-sighted, self-interested proposal that it is. If Mr Morris's committee had looked at the Leader of the Opposition's proposal to reopen the east-west runway the committee's report would have been scathing of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bennelong has been going around Sydney telling everyone that reopening the east-west runway will solve all their problems but he does not tell them how that will occur. Of course, he has no idea how that will occur. The member for Bennelong has not worked out that the east-west runway was never closed. It still operates in adverse conditions when there are crosswinds or congestion restricting the use of the north-south runways. He says, `Reopen it,' as if that is all there is to it. In his view we should not worry about the extensive and expensive environmental impact study that was carried out in relation to the construction of the parallel runway in Sydney. According to the Leader of the Opposition we should forget about the process and just reopen the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department has given evidence that it is clear that a full environmental impact study would be required for any proposal to use the east-west runway for jet operations. The Leader of the Opposition does not tell people that the reason why the east-west runway was downgraded was that that was part of the lawful approval for the parallel runway&mdash;the runway that he and his party are so very keen should be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition does not tell people whether he will make provision for an installation and acquisition program for those severely affected by noise in Sydney's inner west. This is the program that was initiated by this government. Will the Leader of the Opposition make provision to extend that to the 58,000 people who will be affected by the reopening of the east-west runway? Of course he won't!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, and recently at the Senate committee hearings, the member for Bennelong said that the impact of aircraft noise on these people in the south of Sydney is grossly exaggerated. He said that the great bulk of them are only mildly affected and, in any event, they bought their houses knowing full well that they would be under the flight path. The Leader of the Opposition made these remarks in that infamous interview with Mike Carlton. The Leader of the House read more fully from that interview today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that interview the Leader of the Opposition had the hide to say that he knew a little bit about the politics of the St George district. For a fellow who reckons that he knows a little bit about the politics of the St George district he has scant regard for the people that he allegedly grew up with. All this fellow wants to do is dump aircraft noise back on those people. Why does he want to do that? He wants to do that because the good, honest burghers of Hunters Hill, Wollstonecraft and Woolwich have had their properties devalued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should forget about good old John Howard, the friend of the battler, the man who grew up in Canterbury and Earlwood and who knows all about the working people of this country. What would his gift be to those people if he, unfortunately, became Prime Minister of Australia or if, through some bizarre act, he got this legislation up? The Leader of the Opposition would revisit those people with aircraft noise. I would not like this bloke to know too much of the politics of my electorate because, if that is what he thinks knowing the politics of an area is all about, it shows a very dishonest approach to dealing with people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He suggests that people bought their houses in these areas just recently. Those people have been affected by aircraft noise for decades. There is a lot faster turnover of housing on the old Hunters Hill peninsula than there is at Bexley and other parts of the St George region. The member for Bennelong, who used to live in Earlwood, has moved a long way away from those people&mdash;and it is not just from one side of the harbour to the other. His gift to those people, if he had his way, would be to dump aircraft noise in their backyards. He does not give a damn about those people because they are not in his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) earlier in the debate, the member for Bennelong is a very recent convert to the cause of those affected by aircraft noise. The member for Lowe, the member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh), the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin), the member for Barton (Mr Punch), the member for Kingsford-Smith and I have all been active in this campaign for years. The member for Bennelong was active in it, but he was active on the other side. His view was, `Open the third runway. Let it rip.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why the member for Bennelong has suddenly become converted to the idea that aircraft noise is a terrible thing is that his own constituents have finally got it through his thick head that they do not like this idea. I remember going to demonstrations in the early 1990s about Sydney airport and having people from Hunters Hill say to me that they thought that the actions of the member for Bennelong were disgraceful; that he could not give a damn about them; that he did not represent them; that he did not look after them; and that he did not do anything for them because he was in the bag with the New South Wales Liberal government which just wanted to let this airport rip and let it rip and let it rip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that an election is coming close, the honourable member sees a bit of political advantage and all of a sudden becomes committed to the idea of political cynicism. No doubt the member for Warringah, who got up and asked him the little clever question today, is the one who has been saying to him, `Don't worry about any of this truth business. Get out there and be as cynical and dishonest as you possibly can be. There'll be a few votes in it somewhere. Tell `em anything.' That has always been the view of the member for Warringah. He will say anything and do anything as long as he wins. That is his attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the Leader of the Opposition has bought that and today the Leader of the House exposed him for the hypocrite he is. His view in 1989 and his view since then has been there is no real problem about aircraft noise&mdash;so he says. The people of my electorate, he used to say, are exaggerating all this. But now, all of a sudden, with an election in the wind the member for Warringah has told him to sniff the wind, and off they go, converts to the problems of the people of the inner west and the south-west of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even then he was not going to be honest in what he was doing. Had he put forward a private member's bill which said in the bill what he says is an amendment here, which is to increase the use of the runway known as the east-west runway, it might have been a bit more honest. But instead he cloaked it in a bill that was supposed to be doing something about the curfew. The reality is that he cares nought for the curfew. What he wants to do is inflict pain on the people he grew up with. He wanted to sneak this little bill into the House and try to get his amendment to re-open the east-west runway through without notice. But the problem is that we have noticed it. The Morris committee has also noticed it. We are not going to let him or the opposition get away with compromising safety, decreasing capacity at the airport and throwing the noise onto more and more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bennelong disregarded the EIS process for reopening the east-west runway. His disregard for that process is indicative of his attitude to aircraft operations and safety. Despite the experts' statements that concurrent operation of intersecting runways is not as safe as parallel runways, the member for Bennelong steams ahead and says, `We must have intersecting runways. That's the only way that those fine Liberal voters in Woolwich and Hunters Hill will keep voting for me. Therefore we have to do something to hurt the people in south-western Sydney.' The opposition have all sorts of tricky policies that they try to keep close to their chest. Every time we see a little more of what they are up to it is exposed for the attack on ordinary working people that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is going to bat for the people of Hunters Hill and Woolwich. He might try to clothe it and say that he is looking after the interests of the electorate of the member for Lowe and the electorate of the member for Grayndler, but he has scant or no regard for them. He is looking after the property values of Hunters Hill and Woolwich. Who are the people he is attacking? The people of Bexley, Kingsgrove and Beverly Hills. If you ever wanted a metaphor for what the opposition's policies are about across a whole range of things, this unseemly little bill that he was putting forward here is a good one. It is about entrenching privilege on the North Shore of Sydney and attacking the working people of south-western Sydney; keeping up property values at Hunters Hill and Woolwich and attacking the people of Bexley, Beverly Hills and Kingsgrove&mdash;attacking them without even giving them the chance of having an environmental impact statement look at what should happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the best examples of nimby policies I have seen for a long while. The myth the member for Bennelong is perpetrating in his electorate is that somehow or other all the noise in Hunters Hill and Woolwich will go away and those other poor people on the other side of the harbour can catch it all. That is his view and it is a dishonest view. It is not the truth and they know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bennelong has stated publicly on a number of occasions that he thinks this is the only answer. I have a pile of papers showing occasions and how short-sighted, inequitable and how patently unsafe that course of action is. Despite that the member for Bennelong persists. He chooses to forget once again that it was his party, the Liberal Party in New South Wales, from which he sprang and which John Fahey was a Premier of&mdash;they were the ones who were hand in hand with the developers&mdash;that wanted the third runway in the first place. He pushed for the third runway, along with his cronies in the New South Wales government at the time. Now he has the gall to whinge that planes are using it and causing his constituents some trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the member now intend that we return to the simultaneous operations of the east-west and north-south runways and close the third runway? Is that one of the solutions he wants to propose? It was part of the EIS provisions for the opening of the parallel runway that operations on the east-west would be scaled back, so it would be used when weather conditions on the north-south runway precluded that runway from being used. The member for Bennelong knew that the use of the east-west runway would be reduced once the third runway was operational. It did not worry him much at the time but, as I said earlier, self-interest has come creeping into this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what would happen if we did reopen the east-west runway, as the honourable member for Bennelong has suggested. He says he is not an expert in the area, yet he continues to reject the advice of experts concerning safety. He says that he has seen no evidence that simultaneous operations on the east-west and intercepting parallel runways would be unsafe. Because he has not seen it, it does not exist. Perhaps if he removed his hands from his eyes he would be able to see. Instead he is telling the 58,000 people in the south-west of Sydney that they should put their hands over their ears so they do not hear the noise he wants to inflict upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority, which is now Airservices Australia, has repeatedly stated that it strongly advised against the use of the east-west runway in intercepting operations with the parallel runway system. Concerns have also been raised by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, international experts and airline pilots. Of course, we have seen the horrific pictures that the minister provided of scenarios at Sydney airport that could have seen collisions using the east-west runway simultaneously with the north-south runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently, both Qantas and Ansett stated publicly that they believed parallel operations were far safer than intercepting operations. It just seems that the Leader of the Opposition is out of step with everybody else. Use of the east-west runway by jets would reduce capacity at the airport. Parallel runway operations enable an average of 80 movements per hour while the average attained by using cross-runways is about 57 movements per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bennelong insists that we had to have the third runway to increase the capacity. Does he say that does not matter any more? This is the area where the member demonstrates his absolute ignorance of the issue. He says he wants to reduce jet noise over his electorate and other suburbs to the north of the airport. However, reopening the east-west runway will allow the airlines to land propeller-driven aircraft on the stub of the east-west and will allow at least 10 more jets an hour on the north-south runway. Is this not a rather masochistic way of sharing the pain? The outcome will be only more pain for people to the north and south of the runway and more pain all around. The irony would be laughable if it were not such a serious matter for the people of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to thank the member for Bennelong for his amendment, his sad little amendment, which has given us the opportunity of seeing the inadequacy of his and his party's grasp of the complex issues relating to Sydney airport. The member has shown once again that his side are not concerned in the slightest with long-term planning needs. The best he could come up with was a bill that underlined the provisions the government has already put in place for curfews at Sydney. There is nothing new in what he says. The best he could do was grab his pen and say, `A tick for the government'&mdash;because that is what his bill says: `A tick for the government'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney airport saga is a long-running one and I think we all know&mdash;with the exception of the member for Bennelong and the member for Warringah who puts him up to these stunts&mdash;that there are no quick fixes to the issue. The government is committed to the only real solution, which is a second airport for Sydney at Sydney West. The government's proposals will have that airport up and running in time for the Olympics and, thanks to the government, we will then get some advantages in noise reduction at Sydney airport. But, of course, none of that is any thanks to the opposition&mdash;no thanks whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that the government has put forward not only builds on the curfew provisions that are already there, but also reduces the number of international passenger aircraft during the first and last hours of the curfew. It aims to stop aircraft departing right on 11 p.m. and guidelines for assessing applications for curfew dispensations will be prepared with public consultation. The minister will be required to table reasons for each dispensation in parliament within five days. Penalties have been substantially increased up to $100,000 for corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill the government is bringing forward today is a positive one. I congratulate the minister, I congratulate Mr Morris and his committee and I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition should really think twice about these tawdry, politically poll-driven attempts to distort the truth for the people of Sydney and they should admit, as was exposed by the Leader of the House today, that the Leader of the Opposition and his quests for the member for Warringah are shams and frauds. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

In 1989, the time he kept referring to, his electorate was different from the electorate he now represents. Why? Because this man, the member for Watson, was such a brilliant member for Grayndler that his own preselectors did not want him and they put in someone else, the current Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh). So I suggest that, really, the member for Watson should stick to flying in aircraft rather than trying to analyse aircraft and airport policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the government is desperately, desperately, desperately playing catch-up politics. There is one reason and one reason only for this Sydney Airport Curfew Bill now before the House and that is the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), which is the first attempt in 12 1/2 years to try to entrench the curfew that this government now claims to be so concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know why, Mr Deputy Speaker, we are now debating this? Because the Prime Minister, the member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), believes that no-one else in the big, wide, wonderful world can ever have a good idea except him. When the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, came up with a perfectly reasonable, perfectly acceptable bill, what did the Prime Minister say? He said, `We can't have this because we can't have the member for Bennelong doing anything at all.' He certainly cannot have the member for Bennelong showing him up by doing something that should have been done 12 1/2 years ago. That is the problem&mdash;the Prime Minister is `Paul Perfect' and nothing is allowed to detract from his perfection, not even cameras in this parliament shooting him from behind and exposing his bald spot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Prime Minister the other day talking about his former colleague, and indeed friend, Vince FitzGerald. What did he say? He spoke about lemon juice and sucking on lemons. Quite frankly, all I can say is that the Prime Minister must be spending too much time looking in the mirror lately, because the only one producing citric acid in the quantities that the Prime Minister refers to is the Prime Minister himself, and the Prime Minister is detecting his own vices in others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic problem is that this third runway that the government has given us is not a third runway at all. It is a replacement second runway. There are not three functioning runways at Sydney airport. There are now simply two functioning runways at Sydney airport.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called third runway was supposed to mean less noise and more flights. It has actually meant more noise and fewer flights. The so-called third runway was supposed to mean that more aircraft would be taking off and landing over Botany Bay. That means there was supposed to be less noise for everyone. That is what the government kept telling us about this so-called third runway and that is why so many people on that side of the House and this side of the House supported it. Because we believed this government, foolishly, when it said that the so-called third runway was going to mean less noise and more flights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in fact, the so-called third runway has meant that Sydney airport has become a byword for chaos.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the 24 hours after this so-called third runway was brought into operation Ansett Australia had 30,000 phone calls of complaint? You have to ask yourself: why is this so? Why has the so-called third runway turned out to be a $200 million failure? As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out in his excellent answer to a splendidly crafted question in the House today, the reason for this is because the Prime Minister interfered in the 1989 process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have more noise and fewer flights is not because of the concept of the third runway but because the Prime Minister interfered. As Laurie Oakes and Graham Richardson revealed, and as the Leader of the Opposition reminded us today, the Prime Minister is personally to blame for the chaos at Sydney airport, the noise that hundreds of thousands of Sydneysiders now face and the anguish and the pain that so many Sydneysiders now have to endure. </PARA>

We believe that there should be burden sharing. We believe, if you like, in the transport equivalent of progressive taxation. We believe that if there is something unpleasant, something unfortunate, it should not all be dumped on one small group of people. We believe in a fair go for all the citizens of Sydney; not just those who happen to live in the electorates of the member for Watson, the member for Kingsford-Smith or the member for Blaxland. We believe in that light on the hill that they used to believe in, until the member for Blaxland extinguished it. We believe that governments should not put burdens unnecessarily on people's backs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some burdens that government cannot remove&mdash;and should not even try to remove&mdash;but the fact of the matter is that government should never make people's burdens more heavy. This government has made the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians that much less bearable than they were before, because of its policy with respect to Sydney airport. We believe that governments should not play favourites, that governments should not uniquely favour the electorates of the Prime Minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith and Minister for Transport, and the chief bovver boy, the member for Watson. Governments should treat every Australian equally and that is what the opposition's amendment will do with respect to the very serious problem of aircraft noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will repeat the fundamental difference between the position of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong, and the position of the government. When the member for Bennelong said what the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) quoted today, he said it on the basis of repeated assurances from this government that the opening of a third runway would mean less noise and more flights, and take-offs and landings over Botany Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement, that the Leader of the House tried so very unsuccessfully to deride, was based on untruthful assurances from this government. The fact is that if that third runway means, as it has meant, more noise and fewer flights, if the third runway has completely contradicted everything that this government said it would mean, then it is perfectly right to go back to the system that existed before its opening and to reopen the east-west runway, as the member for Bennelong desires and as his bill provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that so many people have been betrayed by this government&mdash;people who thought they could trust the Labor Party. The problem with this government is that the longer it lasts the worse things get. The economy is worse. Interest rates are high and unreliable. Foreign debt is worse. Living standards are worse. Yet, the worse things get, the more loudly and the more hysterically this government boasts. We had a prime example of that today with the performance of not only the Leader of the House but also the Minister for Transport and, more recently, the member for Watson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has tragically let down so many of its traditional supporters in inner western Sydney. It is all very well for the Minister for Transport to let these people down because he has a bolthole. He can always go to his million-dollar beach house on Palm Beach. The Prime Minister can let them down because, after all, he can always go to his $2.2 million mansion in Woollahra. It is interesting that the members opposite go to ALP areas when they are looking for safe seats but they come to Liberal areas when they are looking for nice houses. The fact is that on this issue the member for Bennelong speaks for Sydney. What Sydney is saying is that we are not going to be taken for granted any more by the Labor Party. The member for Bennelong speaks up for those people who have been used and abused by the Labor Party for far too long. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to be able to speak to the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill 1995 because it gives me the opportunity to place before the House a significant aspect of the bill that would probably not be touched upon otherwise. I notice that the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) is leaving the House. When he knows nothing about a bill, he usually plays the man and never plays the debate. That is typical of what we have come to expect from him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the importance of strengthening the curfew at Sydney airport, it is understandable why the majority of speakers on the bill would address their comments to what seem to be the immediate issues. However, I have to question why the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) did not use her remaining 10 minutes of the debate. From my point of view, it is essential that I bring before this House an issue related to the bill which is equally important and which I believe in the long term could affect more people than the present bill's curfew once passed into legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that I object to the strengthening in this bill of the curfew at Sydney airport; I do not at all. I object to the bill's various clauses because there is an inherent understanding&mdash;I would not like to think the smell of a foregone conclusion&mdash;that the proposed airport at Badgerys Creek will be a no curfew operation, something which I have always fought against. This bill&mdash;which takes a much stronger stance on noise than the cynical and gutless vote catching private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;could in the end be just as divisive as it is conciliatory. I am determined to go down on record in this House as not objecting to the bill's provisions for what it means to those around Sydney airport. I think in that respect it will do a great deal for them. However, I object to what it means for those living around the Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. It means to my constituents that they will have a greater chance of having their sleep interrupted by various aircraft which will fly to Sydney West airport when it is opened because the curfew policy has been offered only to Kingsford Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an individual who has lived all of her life in Sydney's west and as a representative of the people in my community since 1971 in all three levels of government, I think I have a pretty good idea of how my constituents will react to this bill, with all its inherent meaning, once it is passed. While my electorate is a fair distance away from electorates in the inner city of Sydney and the North Shore, the seats where the speakers on any issue concerning Sydney airport are usually based, given the impending development of Sydney West airport I think it fair to say that in the year 2000 this bill could have an even greater effect on Sydney's west and its population than on any other area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney Airport Curfew Bill is about Sydney West airport as much as it is about Kingsford Smith. Unfortunately, as much as I would like to be standing here today talking about how the bill treats the residents of both areas with equal consideration and respect, I am afraid that I cannot. I think it behoves me to inform the House, and the rest of Australia for that matter, that Sydney's centre is no longer a five-kilometre radius around the GPO, which is the popular misconception. Its centre is now Parramatta or perhaps even further west. That is where it is geographically and population wise. If we keep expanding at the present rate, in the next 20 years Sydney airport will be sitting on the peripheries of the greater city area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real danger in the debate over Sydney's needs for a second airport and the problems at Kingsford Smith of marginalising the people of Sydney's greater western area, where Sydney's centre really lies. Why is it that the desire of the people whom I represent from Sydney's west for a peaceful night's sleep free from air traffic noise is not seen as important as that of those residents living around Kingsford Smith? Far be it from me to appear cynical, but has someone recently carried out a study and ascertained that anybody living west of Parramatta needs less sleep than people living around Kingsford Smith? If this is the case, I would like to be informed of it, because I certainly have not read of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the bill before the House. In particular, I appreciate the following comment of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of western Sydney can be reassured that the government's comprehensive updating of the environmental impact statement for the new airport will have as its central objective the prevention of noise nuisance arising from night-time operations. It is fundamentally important that we learn the lessons of Sydney airport and ensure that future generations of western suburbs residents are not exposed to excessive noise.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a little different from what the Howard coalition would have us believe. Quite frankly, in all of the debate that has occurred about Sydney's west the opposition has seemed to say, `Let's just ship it out west, pour a few sprinkles on it, stick a cherry on top and then they can learn to live with it.' I believe we are now telling the opposition that this is where we stand and fight for the respect and the consideration that we deserve. Whether we win or lose, fight we will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before in this House when debating Sydney West airport, my community is not ungrateful for the jobs and the improved infrastructure that development of Badgerys Creek will bring. Apart from the odd stirrer, I do not think anyone is under the misapprehension that Sydney does not need a second airport. We are willing to share the burden with the residents of the inner city. What we are saying is that we do not want to bear an uneven burden when Sydney West airport opens. I do not see why we have to, especially when upon the passing of this bill and the opening of Badgerys Creek the residents of Sydney's inner city will benefit. Why can't we all benefit from the passing of the bill? `We don't want it, so you can have it.' The coalition cannot tell us that in the west, but that is how the people of my community will read the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill. And why not? There should not be any surprise in their reaction when it basically spells this out in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 17 states that once Sydney West airport is operational, once it is capable of handling night-time freight aircraft movements, approval for such movements at Sydney airport will be withdrawn. Sydney West will get them all. This bill is saying, `When Sydney West can take the pressure off Kingsford Smith, we're going to have to give it to them.' This is despite reports in the press this weekend that Badgerys Creek, operating on a curfew, will not make any difference to the noise problems that residents around Kingsford Smith presently experience. If that is the case, shouldn't any noise emanating from Sydney's airports be shared equally? In my book, sharing something evenly means both sides are balanced. If one airport has a curfew to balance the noise demands on its nearby residents, surely the other airport could have one as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic part of this bill and that which I want to object to most strongly&mdash;and let me spell it out so that there is no misunderstanding for the record&mdash;is that it seems to me the sins of the father are about to be vested upon the son. Let it also be said that I stand here today not because of the considerable strength of opinion on this matter in my electorate but because of the strong personal feelings that I have always had on this issue. Night operations of aircraft at Sydney airport&mdash;an airport that supposedly already has a curfew in place&mdash;and the amount of traffic that comes into the airport outside these curfew hours have seen one of the largest and most vocal protests ever organised in Sydney, perhaps in Australia, develop over these last few years. The only other protest that I can remember ever reaching a similar scale in recent times was the Gordon below Franklin fiasco in the early 1980s. I am not convinced that, by strengthening this curfew and by having a non-curfew operation at Sydney West airport&mdash;when it opens&mdash;there will not be a similar ground swell of public opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember that the outcry you have at Sydney airport at the moment is over an airport that supposedly already has a curfew in place. Can you imagine the tumult that will reign in Sydney's west once a no-curfew airport begins at Badgerys Creek&mdash;given, as I have already pointed out, that Sydney's west is now the heart of the city?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main thrusts concerning the development of Sydney West airport has been that the environmental problems presently being experienced at Kingsford Smith will not be repeated. The Minister for Transport has given me that guarantee, and he repeated it again in a speech in this House on 10 May when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are similarly determined to ensure that the environmental problems of Sydney's existing airport are not visited upon those living near the new airport. We are doing so because for too long Sydney's aviation infrastructure has suffered from short-term planning and a lack of integration. That approach has resulted in major capacity problems and an enormous burden upon the residents of Sydney's inner city.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree wholeheartedly with the minister, and I sympathise 100 per cent with the residents of those suburbs surrounding Kingsford Smith. The problems they have there now need to be solved, not moved. They need to be dealt with, not delivered elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am convinced this bill will help solve those problems for the inner city, I hope it will not mean the beginning of problems for Sydney's west. Sydney West airport needs to be developed so that the present problems of Kingsford Smith do not spring up there as well. We are all agreed on that, surely. So how does making Badgerys Creek a no-curfew operation solve the problem? It does not; it simply moves it. I want to make it perfectly clear that I am happy to see the curfew at Kingsford Smith tightened. I am simply requesting that the same courtesy being extended to constituents in Sydney's inner city be extended to those in my electorate and in electorates surrounding Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out to me that Sydney West airport will always be a no-curfew operation, that this is already enshrined in regulation. True&mdash;but I will always oppose it. The arguments for the no-curfew policy for Badgerys Creek are well structured and convincing. However, in years to come I feel that these explanations will ring hollow in my constituents' ears, just as they are doing now among people in the inner city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite my personal disappointment over the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill's no-curfew ramifications for Sydney West airport, I am determined not to let it, or this speech, be used to feed the rumour machine that is working at an increasingly feverish pace in my community and in surrounding areas. The people behind these rumour mills purport to act in the community's interest, but in reality are either only acting for their own self-gain or as fronts for the coalition, spoiling for the sake of spoiling, dragging down the government's concerted attempts at improving community consultation over issues such as flight paths at Badgerys Creek, solely for their own political point scoring, and I will continue to expose their pathetic actions at every opportunity I have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You see, although I may take an independent stance on the curfew issue at Sydney West airport, I am still convinced that the only people capable of delivering a new airport in Sydney's west by the year 2000, built with the interests of my community at heart, is the present federal Labor government. The Sydney Airport Curfew Bill is indicative of this fact. Its coverage is exhaustive. Its scope is wide ranging. The findings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which is chaired by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), show the private member's bill of the Leader of the Opposition to be what it always was&mdash;as much hot air as you could get from the back of a jet aeroplane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outside of the inner city, the people in Sydney's west can see only the real coalition behind that caring, sharing front. They know that Sydney West airport is necessary for their own future, as well as for that of Sydney, but they also know that if it is to be built with the help of a coalition government&mdash;Lord help us&mdash;they will not know what will hit them once the first aircraft start rolling in. I have received from the Minster for Transport very public assurances that the Sydney West airport will only go ahead after the most careful community consultation process that can be put into operation has been carried out, and I am pleased to say that the wheels are already in motion in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to airport policy, the coalition are the greatest hypocrites. Since the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill is obviously aimed primarily at that opposition, let me draw to the House's attention some of the machinations which the opposition have been guilty of during the building of the third runway at Kingsford Smith. While shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the member for Fadden (Mr Jull), back in 1991, demanded the federal government stop procrastinating with the third runway at Kingsford Smith. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government has turned procrastination into an artform.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), the Leader of the National Party of Australia, also managed to raise his voice over the third runway. He claimed that to delay the runway's development meant threatening the lives of those using the crowded airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the third runway's completion last year, after its consistently successful operation, and after praise by the airline industry, the opposition leader is now calling for the reintroduction of the east-west runway for the sake of a few votes in his and his colleagues' electorates on the leafy North Shore. He wants to close the third runway and open the east-west corridor, against advice from the airline industry and, most importantly, against the interests of safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe how the opposition can front up in this House, time and time again, and also front up to the Australian people in fact, and make these claims about Sydney airport's future when they have no credibility. They change their position when it suits them, and they generally try to wreak havoc for the sake of petty political point scoring&mdash;not because they want to see Sydney develop a cohesive and well-thought-out airport operation, but solely because they want to discredit the government. I condemn them. I condemn them for their pettiness, vindictiveness and spitefulness, and the people of Sydney do as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the construction of Sydney West airport, the opposition love to sit in judgment, heckling from the sidelines, but they do not actually talk over that heckling about the real reason behind what they say is the government's continued delay or procrastination&mdash;in their words again&mdash;in the building of Badgerys Creek. I will tell them what it is. It is because this government is committed, more so than ever before, to involving the community in its decision making process. We know the hard decisions regarding Sydney's future have to be made. We know that these decisions are never going to be easy and that they are not going to be delivered to the liking of every interest group, but we will continue to work to make sure that this time we get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must put on record, too, my congratulations to the minister and to the authority for opening, just recently, an information house on Badgerys Creek Road near Badgerys Creek  airport. It certainly has been welcomed by communities around the area, and certainly by constituents living in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that continually needs to be raised when we talk about the construction of airports&mdash;and I think it was raised previously in this debate by the member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott)&mdash;is the infrastructure that will be sorely needed when we have this airport at Badgerys Creek up and running by the year 2000. Road patterns have been designated; in fact this government has contributed to the orbital link which will connect the M4 to the M5, and I commend them for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area which is of grave concern to people living in the west is the lack of a railway line structure. Designated areas have been looked at but, at this stage, an environmental impact statement has not been undertaken. A basic need of any airport is to have rail infrastructure in place well before the freight planes&mdash;or, for that matter, the passenger planes&mdash;start coming in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are really to look at Sydney's Kingsford Smith and Sydney West airports as running in conjunction with one another&mdash;and I have always said they are not to supplement one another but are to run in conjunction with one another&mdash;the infrastructure must be there not only to transport the goods that are needed and provided but also so that people will have the opportunity of coming in to either airport. I believe that infrastructure must be in place well before the year 2000, and certainly well before the airport is built and completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the state government of New South Wales must acknowledge that the responsibility of rail within the state of New South Wales rests within their area of responsibility, and that it is up to them to come to the party&mdash;not with just rhetoric and words&mdash;in negotiation with the federal government regarding where that rail line is to be built and who will fund the cost of building that rail line. We do not need just a rail line: we need a good airport, and we need it well constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier today in my speech to the House, we need community consultation on flight paths. Many of the rumours circulating in the area include the statement that we know the flight paths and that we are just not telling people. We know that is not correct. I know that everyone in government and in opposition know that is not correct, but we have to continue, with the cooperation of the minister and the transport department, to make sure that the consultations with respect to airport strategies, airport policies and flight paths are taken in conjunction with people, and that people's concerns are kept in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being parochial and representing an electorate like the one I do, I would say that I see nothing wrong with the flight paths going south-west. Other people might object to that. People who are looking at simulating aircraft flight paths in the vicinity of Sydney and Badgerys Creek may say that I do not have the information and that, therefore, I do not know what I am talking about. I probably do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only stand in this House without the expertise of my professionals and offer them the advice of my constituents. They are saying that they live in this area and they have built in the area. They have come to this area to appreciate it, and they like what they have. They were never informed in the early 1960s, 1970s or 1980s that there was going to be an airport at west Sydney. This decision was not made until 1985. They are now telling us to make sure that we listen to them and that when that construction goes ahead it is done with the full cooperation, consultation and involvement of the people in those communities who are going to be affected by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the present bill to the House. I feel sure that the guarantees the minister has delivered in this bill to Kingsford Smith and the surrounding areas in tightening the curfew will also be the same guarantees that we in the west will welcome when we start looking at the consultation process involving the flight paths. I can then truly go back to my constituents and say that at least we are taking on board what they are saying to us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly interesting to listen to a lot of the government speakers who are participating in this debate today with regard to the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill 1995. Let us bear in mind that the original bill was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) into this House on 26 June 1995 in an attempt to enshrine in legislation the curfew that has existed under this government in regulation only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that that move has prodded the government into coming back with their own bill today, which is what we are debating. It basically says the same thing. The advice I have is that the bill will achieve essentially the same thing, which is legislative backing for the current curfew. The current curfew is the same in both bills. Another thing that the Leader of the Opposition highlighted this afternoon in the debate is that the opposition is not prepared to support the upcoming legislation that will be required for the sale of the FAC airports, particularly KSA in Sydney, without the government reopening the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the current disgraceful situation as far as Kingsford Smith airport is concerned and the atrocious reputation that we have around the world. I highlight the Australian taxpayer in this debate. Members of the government say, `We did this and that. We are building Badgerys Creek. We built the parallel runway' as if it were their money. It is not their money; it is the Australian taxpayers' money. The Australian Labor Party in government have spent $250 million worth of Australian taxpayers' money building the parallel runway or, as it was termed at the time, the third runway. And for what effect or benefit? What has been achieved by spending $250 million? We are currently averaging about 50 to 60 aircraft movements per hour. That is not much different from what it was before. It is probably a little worse than what it was before the government spent $250 million of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued by a number of experts that this could be increased to 100 aircraft movements per hour if the east-west runway were opened and air traffic control management were improved. The technology and the ability to do that exist, so why is it not happening? That question is asked many times, particularly by many residents in a lot of government held seats in and around that airport and now by residents along the north shore of Sydney. Why is it not happening? Why are the air traffic control management procedures not improved upon what they are at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The patterns that aircraft have to fly and the altitudes at which they have to fly those patterns when they are approaching Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport do not exist anywhere else in the world. They have to come in from eight miles out at 3,000 feet. When they get to the North Shore of Sydney and close to those suburbs, they are 2,000 feet above those properties and operating under 80 per cent power. That is why it is so noisy. Why is this happening? As you go around the argument, it really keeps coming back to base political motivations. This will be borne out as different independent experts assess the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of other questions need to be asked in this debate of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), whose electorate coincidentally happens to be on the eastern end of the east-west runway that is being closed down. One question that must be asked is why the new control tower is not operating. The new parallel runway is operating. Why is the control tower not operating? The Minister for Transport should also be asked whether he instructed on or about Australia Day this year Mr Bill Swingler, the then CEO of the Federal Airports Corporation, who has since left, and Mr Buck Brooksbank, who was the acting CEO of the CAA at the time, to not open that tower. It would be interesting to hear the minister's response. They are a couple of very salient points in this whole debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition introduced this bill on 26 June. The government has come back today with their own bill, playing catch-up politics. It basically gives effect to the same measures, which is enshrining in legislation the curfew that is now in regulation. The government can say, `We are looking after our constituents.' The members in the House now and the members who spoke before can go back to their electorates and say that they are looking after their constituents. They have been in government for 12 1/2 years. Why has something like this not been done before now? Why has it not been legislated for so that it is locked in and cannot be changed without a debate and a vote in this House? Regulations can be changed without reference to the House, but legislation cannot. Why did the government members not show that sort of integrity to their constituencies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been one hell of a hot potato for many Labor Party members in that area of Sydney. It has been kicked around and it has cost ministers portfolios. Remember the last time that the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) was a minister. He had to fall on his sword because he had to keep the faith with his electorate. That was in 1989 when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got involved in the decision making process. We have heard a couple of times in this debate this afternoon how the Prime Minister was involved in 1989. I will read it to the House again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us find out why the government will not reopen Sydney's east-west runway. The truth was revealed in Laurie Oakes's article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin </EMPHASIS>in December last year in which he referred to the section of Graham Richardson's autobiography which deals with the 1989 decision to build the parallel runway at Sydney airport. It talks about a conversation that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) had with the member for Barton, who was a minister at the time. He did not agree with the decision. He fell on his sword and went to the back bench. He has only now returned to the ministry, six years later. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It was Keating who really swung it in the end," Ray said. "Keating is the one people should be mad at. He not only got the third runway decision through cabinet but was responsible for changes to the original plan which are now causing massive problems."</PARA>
<PARA>What changes were they? They were the flight paths that these aircraft take from eight miles out at 3,000 feet in and around the northern suburbs before coming down that main runway. Mr Oakes went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original proposal was supposed to be that aircraft should take off only to the south and land from the south so that they flew over water rather than houses. Clever Keating changed that and sent them roaring over suburbia. The east-west runway was supposed to continue operating, but it was Keating who killed that idea, too, and ensured that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">all</EMPHASIS> planes operated on the north-south axis.</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't that incredible. So that decision, which involved channelling all the noise over the north-south axis of Sydney airport, was made by the person who is now the Prime Minister of Australia. I suppose that he was the Treasurer at the time. He is now the Prime Minister of Australia. His old mate the Minister for Transport is the fall guy for that decision. But they have gone about implementing that decision in an extraordinary, incompetent way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can you imagine? We started in 1989 with two runways&mdash;a north-south runway and an intersecting east-west runway. The intersecting runways operated for nearly 40 years quite successfully, quite safely, without the technology that is available today as far as air traffic control is concerned. That was the situation in 1989. Then the taxpayers of Australia, courtesy of the Australian Labor Party in government, spent $250 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we ended up with? We now have 1 1/2 runways. We are still getting only 50 to 60 aircraft movements an hour, which is an absolute disgrace on world standards. That lack of movement is all because they can take off only on the north-south access. They are not allowed to take off on the east-west runway. We have seen $250 million worth of taxpayers' money spent, and the effect is a reduction in the efficiency of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Day in and day out we sit in this place listening to government members crow about efficiency, macro-economic reform and all the other reforms that have taken place in this country.

It is no different from the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the common link between this exercise, Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, the waterfront, transport on the waterfront, the sale of Qantas, and ANL&mdash;the bill which we are going to debate tomorrow? The common denominator is the Minister for Transport. It is unbelievable. A lot of people across Australia cannot understand how he has held down the portfolio for the time that he has. There is only one reason: the Prime Minister of Australia owes his political fortunes to the Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith. It is absolutely outrageous. The people of Australia, particularly the people in Sydney, should not accept what has been foisted upon them by this government. </PARA>

Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you and I know exactly that fact, along with anybody in this place who is a regular traveller who has to come in and out of Sydney airport. I live about 70 minutes flying time north of this place. You would expect that I should be able to leave home on a Monday morning and get here in time for parliament to sit at 12.30 on Monday afternoon. That is not so. I have to leave home on Sunday afternoon to get here in time for parliament to sit. </PARA>

It comes back to the management this government has put in place as far as Kingsford Smith airport is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All afternoon we have been listening to government members rave on that it is not safe to run an intersecting cross-strip. I said a while ago, and many speakers before me have said, that Kingsford Smith airport operated without any major dramas with an intersecting east-west runway for 40 years. Technology has improved for air traffic control. New radar systems are coming up that can direct aircraft to land on those two parallel runways, and the evidence is at hand that they can operate at the same time as the east-west runway. </PARA>

There are intersecting runways operating in Johannesburg, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Paris, San Francisco and London's Heathrow airport.

Even his colleague Senator Collins has said in debates in the Senate that it is safe to use the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his address this afternoon when introducing the government's bill, the minister spoke of the possibility of using just the stub of the east-west runway and only allowing propeller-driven aircraft to land on that stub. We have heard all the government speakers since talk about how that is going to generate more jet aircraft traffic down that north-south corridor. That is ridiculous. They should open the thing right up. Under certain weight conditions, jumbos can take off on that east-west runway. It is the shortest access straight out to sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regime that the Minister for Transport is running, as far as Kingsford Smith airport is concerned, in refusing to even contemplate opening the east-west runway is ridiculous. There is information available from international experts which confirms that the east-west runway can be reopened. A letter that was written to Barry Cotter, the infamous mayor of Marrickville Council, from William Hoffman, the president of a company called US Flight Transportation Associates Incorporated, confirms in writing that you could have safe and efficient simultaneous operations from all three Kingsford Smith airport runways. The taxpayers of Australia might get some benefit from the $250 million they have invested in the parallel runway that the majority of them will never get to use. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all about redistribution. We are always listening to the members on the government side talk about equity of this and equity of that&mdash;social justice. What the Leader of the Opposition is proposing is a little bit of equity in the distribution of the aircraft noise around Sydney rather than focusing it down a narrow funnelled flight path. That is compounded because of the instructions that we believe have been issued by the Minister for Transport and the Prime Minister about how aircraft, particularly those coming from the south and the south-west, must approach that north-south access. As I said before, that is from a navigation point eight kilometres out. They have to be flying at 3,000 feet, under 80 per cent power and come around onto that northern approach to the north-south access and the runway. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, when the decision was made to build the third runway, the consequences of that decision were recognised by very few people. There were no double-page spreads every day in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> talking about the consequences of the airport. There was no campaign equal to the campaign run by the pilots in every plane circling over Sydney when they said, `If only the government would bite the bullet and build a third runway you would not be flying over Sydney for hours and you would get to your appointment on time.' Of course people are still flying over Sydney for hours. The third runway unfortunately has not been the answer to that question. I will come later to the opposition's view in those days. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office offered to help anyone in the electorate put in a submission. We helped hundreds of people. I went to public meeting after public meeting and put out brochures saying, `If you need help or if you want to send me a copy of your submission, do it so we can make absolutely certain those submissions are not ignored.' In fact, Mitchell McCotter got 900 submissions from the public, including my submission and those of many branches of the party in my electorate. We brought the media along and we took those submissions in great boxes to the office of Mitchell McCotter in north Sydney to make sure that they could not be ignored and that the public would be listened to because the first draft noise management plan was an absolute disgrace. It was totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the revised options, when Mitchell McCotter had to take notice of the vast number of submissions, were taken up by the government, including the very important one of extending insulation to schools and churches.

In my submission I called for the current curfew to be protected through legislation. I wanted penalties for curfew breaches to be enhanced and enforced. I sought assurances about the maintenance of the curfew during the 2000 Olympics. This bill meets all these requests. That is because the government is actually doing it properly. This bill is not the result of political opportunism and hypocrisy. This bill is the result of working out the most useful answer to the concern of the constituents in relation to the curfew issue. That is why our bill is sensible and the opposition's is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that I distinguished between the genuine people that I am representing and political opportunism. The leading political opportunists are the Liberal Party and the No Aircraft Noise Party. Let me go first of all to the Liberal  Party. Many people on this side of the House have quoted back at the opposition their statements in 1989 and other years. No-one has drawn attention to the fact that there was a vote in this House when the member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who I think was the shadow minister at that time, came in on 11 November 1991 and moved for the suspension of standing orders to complain that the government was not acting quickly enough to get the third runway into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said in his speech that the reason for this was probably that people like the member for Barton (Mr Punch), the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), the member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin) and me as the then member for Phillip had all sorts of problems with this plan. We were actually being blamed by the opposition for the fact that it was not being done quickly enough. They come in here and talk about thinking things through. They were the ones that wanted to rush in without the consultation processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was once asked how I voted on 11 November 1991. There is an urban myth going around that the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) is the only person who ever voted against the third runway. We voted against the opposition's demand that we get a wriggle on and rush straight into this. Many of my colleagues have talked about the hypocrisy of the opposition, which I must say I find very difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the amendment to our legislation in relation to reopening the east-west runway. Let me make it absolutely clear that one of my demands, along with the demands from local government and state government in my electorate, has constantly been for the reopening of the east-west runway. I have never failed my constituents when they have asked me to ask for the reopening of the east-west runway. I have argued it consistently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have come up against a couple of arguments which mean I cannot accept the amendment moved by the opposition. One of the arguments relates to safety. We are all lay people in relation to this matter. I am a lay person. Everyone in my electorate is a lay person. The Minister for Transport and the government are lay and have to take the advice of experts. It is no use those on the other side standing up in this place and saying it works in other cities in Australia or it works in other cities in the world. Unfortunately, this is Kingsford Smith airport and it has its own requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are given the advice&mdash;and, as the minister said, if those opposite were in government they would get the same advice&mdash;I finally have to accept that advice. It is not as if the advice is different. Both Qantas and Ansett have endorsed the parallel runways as safer than intersecting runways&mdash;and do not forget that the fact that there are two parallel runways has made all the difference to what the situation was before. Despite the fact that I have argued consistently for the opening of the east-west runway, if it cannot be opened, it cannot be opened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have now come across an argument from the airlines suggesting that they use the east-west runway for propeller aircraft. That would be a disaster for my constituents if it were opened. As has been stated so often, unfortunately they want that so that they can put up to 10 more jets an hour on the north-south runway&mdash;an even worse problem for my constituents, who are suffering terribly. I am not pretending for one minute that everything we do can solve their problems. What I am saying is that you make what incremental improvements you can. This bill is a necessary improvement. Unfortunately, despite everything we have argued over the years, it appears now&mdash;unless better advice comes&mdash;that the opening of the east-west runway is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the No Aircraft Noise Party. It is incredible what they think they can get away with. This will be of great interest to my colleague at the table, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). In Grayndler they are saying, `Close KSA; let's start Badgerys.'  Out in Badgerys Creek they are organising around banners to stop Sydney West airport. NAN's biggest fear is that their leaflets will get mixed up; that they will start distributing the Grayndler leaflets in the electorate of the member for Prospect and that the leaflets for her electorate will be distributed in mine. They are the greatest political opportunists you have ever come across. They can't even get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Prospect and I have the same concerns for our constituents. One of the things that is really upsetting to me is that the constituents of the member for Prospect are being manipulated and deluded into thinking there is any comparison at all between the situation of my constituents in Grayndler and their situation and the situation of all those in the areas out there. As the member for Prospect said in her speech, and as everyone on our side has said, the problems will not be repeated. There has been ample opportunity to have discovered what things are wrong around Kingsford Smith airport and ensure that they are not repeated out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Prospect referred to the fact that an information centre has been set up out in her area to explain to people what it will be like. I have suggested that one bit of information they might put out there&mdash;and I will have to check whether they have done it&mdash;is some photos of where an aeroplane would be over Parramatta and where an aeroplane is over Leichhardt, Sydenham or Tempe. My constituents live cheek by jowl next door to the airport. In Sydenham and St Peters the tiles get taken off the roof by the landing planes and the planes taking off. That is the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one wants noise. The people at Pymble do not want noise. The people in my previous electorate, Phillip, were not as bothered by this issue. I could not even make it an issue in my electorate out there. Even though planes went over, it was nothing compared with what happens in the inner west. People have got to understand that, even though planes are flying overhead, it is not the same as having them on your roof. There is no comparison between the siting of the airport at Badgerys Creek, provided development does not allow people to live next door to it&mdash;and there is plenty of time to stop that&mdash;and the siting of the Kingsford Smith airport bang in the middle of the most densely populated area of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got to take on the issue of the way that NAN in particular is trying to transfer the issue of noise in a manipulative way to the area around Badgerys Creek. It is true that we have made the rest of Australia understand that the issue of noise in the inner west is terrible. It is tragic. It has changed people's lives. It will not be like that&mdash;it cannot be like that&mdash;around Badgerys Creek. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday was a perfect example of that. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) has been overseeing an absolutely stunning program to make sure that the insulation program that the government is implementing will be done properly. There has been a pilot study. They have tried out every possible way of getting it right on heritage houses, federation houses, timber houses, brick houses and blocks of units. They have tried solutions to every problem that will come up. They have tried schools, nursing homes and so on to get it right. The people who have had their houses done cannot believe it is so good. The fact is that if you are affected by aircraft noise you certainly need that insulation; if you are affected to a certain level you must have it. It is a benefit that the government can give, and is providing. </PARA>

They keep repeating one piece of tape of one person whose house was insulated and who managed to get on the television. It was a piece of tape&mdash;which, in my view, must have been doctored&mdash;to show that the whole insulation program is likely to lead to a fire hazard, whereas all the tests that have been repeated and repeated on this insulation work have shown that that cannot happen. But will television put that on? Of course they will not. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will reduce the quotas for international passenger movements during curfew shoulder periods and will require these movements to be justified.

It was Gough Whitlam that decided to cut the Gordian knot of all of those inquiries that had not produced any agreed outcome by nominating Galston, which he knew to be in the electorate of Berowra, as a suitable site for an airport. He did so at a time when there was no legitimate planning reason for identifying that site. It was never seen as being a reasonable or viable prospect. That introduced me to the politics of airports, because it became a major issue in the Parramatta by-election which I was to contest and which then brought me to this place. </PARA>

But, of course, the seats occupied by opposition members did not really matter&mdash;seats such as Bennelong, Bradfield, Mackellar, Berowra and Mitchell, as well as the electorate of Cook to the south held by my colleague Mr Dobie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see here is a management issue by the government wanting to convince those people who are as angry as the minister and the member for Grayndler outlined that it can manage the issue. Some members opposite clearly believe that they are at risk. They are worried about the level of support that the No Aircraft Noise Party might have and they are concerned that Independents might well be able to take ministers out of their formerly safe seats. Because the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) brought forward a bill to legislate permanently for a Sydney airport curfew, the government again wanted to try to manage the issue by introducing this bill to codify the Air Navigation (Aerodrome Curfew) Regulations. The explanatory memorandum to the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill 1995 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill imposes a curfew at Sydney Airport, together with a number of related restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill reflects the present curfew controls embodied in the Air Navigation (Aerodrome Curfew) Regulations together with some additional controls following the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure advisory report . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we are dealing with a bill that was designed simply to put legislation into the government's name to give effect to the private member's bill moved by my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition. Having explained what this bill is about, I would just mention the amendment that the Leader of the Opposition proposes in relation to the principal issue of importance. The proposed amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"PART 3A&mdash;OTHER NOISE ABATEMENT MEASURES</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Ministerial direction to AA</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">20A</EMPHASIS> As soon as possible after the commencement of this Act, the Minister must give a direction under section 16 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Air Services Act 1995</EMPHASIS> to require Airservices Australia to revise the noise abatement procedures for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport to disperse more equitably the noise generated by the operation and use of aircraft landing at, or taking off from, the aerodrome by increasing the use of the runway known as the east-west runway.".</PARA>
<PARA>That introduces the principal issue which members opposite&mdash;and I note from some news reports even the minister at the table, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin)&mdash;have at other times endorsed as the appropriate measure to be taken to ensure a more equitable outcome to the noise affliction that so many residents of particularly northern and southern Sydney are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to associate myself with that amendment and the arguments adduced by my colleague the Leader of the Opposition, because the impact, particularly to the north-west of Sydney, has been as significant in my electorate as it has been to so many of my colleagues. Just to ensure that there is some understanding of what has happened, the re-routing of planes to the north of Sydney&mdash;whether they come from Adelaide; whether they come from Melbourne; whether they come from other parts south, west or even to the east of Sydney&mdash;means that planes are put in holding patterns which bring them over the north-western suburbs of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had extensive complaints from my electorate&mdash;from as far south as Epping, Beecroft, Cheltenham and Pennant Hills where I live and from as far north as Normanhurst, Wahroonga, Hornsby, Asquith, Mount Colah and Berowra. I have also had very considerable complaints from Cherrybrook, which is west of Sydney. The concerns are not only about the extent of noise affliction but also about the impact that this decision has had upon the values of properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent to which my constituency is affected is something to which the government pays little heed. None of the planning which the government has given effect to by way of compensation has any impact upon the north-western suburbs of Sydney.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of quoting from the past about the way in which people have responded to these issues. But in the not so distant past, at the end of last year, there were a number of members of parliament who will vote against the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition who were actively advocating the reopening of the east-west runway.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this nonsense where the government likes to have us believe that it adheres to the Westminster system, yet ministers are able to go out and play this game that Labor backbenchers are playing. They can be in their electorates saying one thing about their opposition to decisions that the government takes, and in this place are supporting by their votes decisions that the government takes. We are going to see it again today, as the Leader of the Opposition identified, from a number of backbenchers. But it is more significant when ministers go out and publicly disagree with decisions of the government, put another view which they cannot get up, stand by that issue in this parliament by a vote and refuse to follow the Westminster convention and resign in order to put their views properly and forcefully when they disagree with their colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very good reasons why the views of those ministers ought to be adopted and why they ought to be prepared to support the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. The situation has not changed. The curfew legislation, which was proposed at the public meeting at which the minister was present, was a step that should have been taken by the government. But it was not a step followed up by the government; it was a step followed up by the Leader of the Opposition. It is quite clear that the government has been embarrassed into action, only because this matter was taken up by this side of the parliament. The government's pace in this matter has been clearly slothful, and now we have what I would say is unseemingly prompt processing of this bill through the parliament&mdash;but only in order to get the government off the hook, as it sees it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a reference today to `jets thundering down the north-south runway' as a description of the sorts of steps that members of the coalition are alleged to have supported, through advocacy in the past, as an approach to developing the north-south runway. But you will not find on record comments by the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that the east-west runway should be closed. What you find is a forceful advocacy by him that the pain that is associated with this measure ought to be genuinely shared around areas surrounding the airport; that the pain described so vividly by the minister who spoke before me&mdash;the Minister for Consumer Affairs, and the member for Grayndler, Jeannette McHugh&mdash;be alleviated by ensuring that those people who are some further distant in the east and west at least have some of the flights over their area and that a genuine sharing of the hardship results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are genuine steps that can be taken. It will sort out the government members in the way in which they see this matter.

She was one of those who was out there in the field arguing for the reopening of the east-west runway. Clearly there are no safety issues involved. We have heard lengthy quotes today from the report by Captain Skinner and certain overseas experts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Sydney Airport Curfew Bill which is currently before the House. Unlike the private member's bill proposed by the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), which would have merely entrenched the existing curfew arrangements established by regulations, this bill will tighten the curfew in a number of important respects. When it comes into effect those suffering from aircraft noise should experience some significant improvement in their circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill addresses a number of key points that I and others have been particularly concerned about for some time. To take one example, as a resident of Leichhardt I am well aware of the particular aggravation caused by the final bunch of aircraft taking off immediately before the curfew comes into effect at 11 p.m. The problem is compounded by the fact that these movements typically consist of heavy international jet aircraft leaving on long journeys with a full load of fuel. I can assure members that having one's sleep disturbed by a jumbo jet rumbling overhead at full power is not a pleasant experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in this bill should help to ameliorate this problem. Likewise, I am sure that the tightening of the weekend curfew will be welcomed by my constituents, as will the significantly increased penalty provisions and the further restrictions on freight movements during the curfew hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is given added importance by the impending sale of airport leases, which has led to a degree of public anxiety as to the sort of operational regime that will apply in future. It will be important to dispel this impression&mdash;and in this context I note that the forthcoming leasing bills will contain much improved democratic controls over airport planning, development and operations. In particular, many people undoubtedly fear a progressive weakening of the curfew provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill clearly moves in the opposite direction&mdash;towards a progressive tightening. I intend to work to ensure that things continue to move in this direction. This bill is a useful start, but much more will need to be done in future. Relief for seven hours out of 24 is hardly adequate. Not everyone is a night owl choosing to go to bed at 11 p.m., or an early riser bounding out of bed at 6 a.m.&mdash;not to mention the needs of young children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The early completion of the Sydney West airport is crucial in this regard, as indicated by the specific provisions in the bill requiring the relocation of freight movements during the curfew hours once the new airport is completed. There is no doubt that further significant improvements in the curfew at Kingsford Smith will depend on the availability of the new airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the final go-ahead was given to the third runway in 1991&mdash;a decision which, as the public record shows, I and others strongly opposed&mdash;I have worked assiduously to keep the second airport alive. Following the government's decision to build the third runway, the initial intention was to build no more than a small general aviation facility at Badgerys Creek. This has since been progressively upgraded. In 1991 I successfully lobbied the then minister, Bob Collins, to have the airport upgraded to being jet capable, and this proposal was subsequently endorsed by cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infrastructure elements of last year's Working Nation statement and this year's budget provided me, as a minister on the Expenditure Review Committee, an opportunity to support further enhancements. The proposal, as members would know, has been further significantly upgraded to provide some $760 million to build an airport and associated infrastructure, with a 2.9-kilometre runway capable of handling all but the largest jets operating near the extremity of their range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is no doubt that more has to be done. I strongly believe&mdash;and I am speaking here as a local member rather than as a minister&mdash;that the proposed runway should be built to its intended ultimate length of four kilometres as soon as possible and that if the airlines persist with their current reluctance to move to Sydney West we should be prepared to put in place a pricing and regulatory regime designed to ensure that the new airport picks up a significant share of the traffic rather than just a small proportion of the projected growth at Kingsford Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House begins this process by tightening the curfew further once Sydney West airport is available, but further measures are likely to be required, in my view. These should include a capacity cap at Kingsford Smith airport, a program of transferring categories of aircraft such as freight and charter, an increasing proportion of international traffic and the necessary development of Sydney West airport to handle the demand so generated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the argument put forward by some that the question of the site for Sydney's second airport be reopened. Badgerys Creek was selected after an exhaustive process that examined every conceivable site within a reasonable radius of Sydney. This included an explicit examination of issues like fog and turbulence, which have been referred to in evidence to the Senate committee. The Badgerys Creek EIS contains a useful summary table covering these matters for each of the possible airport sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing we need to do at this stage, in my view, is to reopen the second airport site issue. To do so will guarantee that there will be no possibility of a second airport until well into the next century. I fully understand the concerns of my colleagues representing seats in western Sydney that the EIS process be properly updated and that their constituents be provided with genuinely useful information. This is obviously imperative. But I would say to them that there is absolutely no comparison between the kind of noise impact being experienced by people in inner Sydney and that likely to occur as a result of operations at Sydney West airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to the member for Bennelong's proposed amendment on the east-west runway in a moment. Many people, understandably, are anxious to seize on this as a short-term panacea. I will argue that, rather than being a panacea, such a decision raises the risk of a significant worsening of the problem in the medium term. But first I have to make a few comments on the breathtaking hypocrisy of the member for Bennelong on these issues. At the time when all other representatives of electorates significantly affected by the airport were opposing the third runway, and when the government was locked in intense and closely divided debate on the issue, all members of the opposition, including the member for Bennelong, were raising a constant clamour of demands for the government to stop dithering and build the thing immediately. The member for Bennelong's contribution right at the crucial time of the cabinet debate back on 21 March 1989 was to say to Mike Carlton on 2GB:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I grew up under the flight paths in the St George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of the area and I've always regarded the issue as being grossly exaggerated in terms of the impact on the local residents.</PARA>
<PARA>He now professes shock and surprise about the impact that this is having on people living to the north of the airport. However, the whole point of the third runway was to raise Sydney's airport capacity by replacing a configuration of two intersecting runways with one in which the great bulk of movements are handled on two parallel runways, capable of operating independently once all the relevant systems are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this would mean a major increase in the noise burden for those to the north was transparently obvious to all, apparently bar the member for Bennelong. The proposal to reduce the east-west runway to a residual cross-wind runway was clearly spelt out in the government announcement of March 1989, and the subsequent EIS proceeded on this premise. This is precisely why I and all other Labor and Independent members representing seats near the airport&mdash;including, I might add, those who actually stood to benefit from reduced movements on the east-west runway&mdash;strongly opposed the proposition from the outset, and made detailed submissions to this effect throughout the EIS process. All this apparently escaped the attention of the member for Bennelong until very recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before coming in I had a look at the second volume of the supplement to the third runway EIS, which contains an alphabetical tabulation of the consultant's responses to submissions responding to the draft EIS. In response to my own submission, for example, some 60 distinct points are listed and addressed. There is no record of any submission from the member for Bennelong&mdash;between Hotel, Intercontinental and Howell, M. there is a vacuum. Certain of the information in the EIS has, of course, been shown to be wrong&mdash;particularly the gross underestimation of the rate of traffic growth and the meteorological information that underpinned estimates of the number of northerly take-offs. But the basic operational principles relating to runway usage, and the appalling implications of these for people to the north, have been explicit and clear at least since 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where was the member for Bennelong when this highly contentious public controversy was going on? Was he asleep at the time? Or perhaps he just wanted the third runway to be built but not used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the last point, Mr Speaker, I return to the 1989 Mike Carlton interview which I referred to earlier. When the proposition was put to the member for Bennelong that some people may have a reduction in noise once the third runway was built, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people will because you'll have the north-south pattern. I think the case for it on general interest grounds is absolutely overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA>Note he said, `because you'll have the north-south pattern'. In other words, he was then extolling as a virtue the very shift to north-south operations which he now professes to abhor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could return to the east-west issue, I strongly recommend that honourable members, if they get a chance, take a close look at the submissions and verbal evidence given to the Senate committee now looking at aircraft noise. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read just about all of it thus far and it sheds some interesting light on these issues. The claim has been made that the decision on the east-west runway was motivated by solely political considerations. There have been submissions arguing different viewpoints presented by Airservices Australia, which is the successor organisation to the CAA, the pilots, the air traffic controllers and others, and I see that the airlines themselves have now bought into the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the statutory responsibility for the safety of operational procedures at Sydney airport lies with Airservices Australia, whose staff are directly responsible for air traffic control. They presented a detailed submission to the Senate committee, which included 11 possible scenarios for runway use at Kingsford Smith airport, encompassing Airservices Australia's preferred options, as well as various alternative proposals that have been canvassed in public debate. Of these, six were regarded as viable options from Airservices Australia's point of view and only one of these involved the regular use of the east-west runway&mdash;that is, using it as other than a cross-wind runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal was to allow five to 10 small turbo prop aircraft per hour to take off on that part of the east-west runway that lies to the east of the intersection with the north-south runway. This is an option heavily favoured by regional users. Airservices Australia argued that every aircraft thus moved out of the main north-south stream would free up one to two slots for heavy jet movements on the north-south axis, since the smaller, slower aircraft require more separation than the jets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious downside to this for people to the north is the scope it creates for yet more heavy jet movements and noise as traffic demand continues to grow. Furthermore, by enhancing total capacity at KSA, it reduces pressure for the early development of the second airport. I regard this as the worst case scenario for the future of Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airservices Australia also analysed options for the regular use of the east-west runway by large jet aircraft. In essence, two cases were considered, corresponding&mdash;to use the standard jargon&mdash;to `dependent' and `independent' operations. Dependent operations refers to a situation where movements on one runway are separated from, and slotted between, operations on the other runway. Independent operations&mdash;also called Simops&mdash;involve aircraft on one runway stopping short of the intersection with the other runway, thereby allowing operations on the other runway to proceed independently. Of these two options, only Simops would allow a comparable movement rate to parallel operations. However, Airservices Australia's position is emphatic, and I quote from their submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airservices would not be prepared to restore simultaneous independent runway operations involving the use of the east west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north-south runway system.</PARA>
<PARA>Airservices Australia cite safety factors in support of this position and on this they have been absolutely consistent. They did not like Simops with a single north-south runway. They like them even less with two north-south runways. And, contrary to what was said earlier in this debate by the Leader of the Opposition, this view is broadly supported by the air traffic controllers. At the Senate committee, the President of the Civil Air Operations Officers Association, Mr Robert Lorschy, was asked about the safety of cross-runway operations. He replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are less safe. They rely more heavily upon the skill of the aerodrome controller in judging the point of conflict between two aircraft operating on the crossing runway set up . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Now it could be that our air traffic controllers are overly conservative in these matters. I know that some pilots hold to this view. I have just returned from the United States and observed some things there that I suspect would have made our controllers' hair stand on end. But my point is that, in judging the likely impact of a decision to reopen the east-west runway, we cannot ignore the stance of the organisation and people with day-to-day operational control of the airport and responsibility for its safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that part of the story here is an understandable difference of perspective between those responsible for control and safety of individual aircraft, the pilots, and those whose responsibility it is for the safety and efficient functioning of an airport system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On some issues, undoubtedly, the pilot's viewpoint has to be treated very seriously. I instance the issue of acceptable cross-wind tolerances where I know a number of pilots have some serious concerns about operations at Sydney. I believe these concerns have to be taken very seriously, and I have raised this matter with the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the other possibility is dependent operations, in which an aircraft is not cleared to move until the aircraft on the other runway has passed through the intersection point. However, Airservices Australia claim that this mode of operation would result in a substantial reduction in the hourly movement rate well below current demand levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these points to show that the simple panacea of restoring east-west operations is far from straightforward. The underlying problem is that demand for aircraft movements has continued to grow far more rapidly than projected a few years ago, to the point that the extra capacity provided by the third runway will soon be exhausted. In these circumstances, a simple return to the old status quo is untenable. Things have moved beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the advocates of the east-west runway reopening need to think carefully about what is likely, in practice, to happen if they were to wake up one day and find that the east-west runway had been reopened for more than cross-wind operations. Is any government of either persuasion going to instruct Airservices Australia to restore Simops with two parallel runways in the face of emphatic warnings that it is unsafe? Such a government would be publicly torn to shreds the next time there was an incident&mdash;as has happened regularly in the past&mdash;or worse. Or is it realistic to imagine any real world government reverting to dependent operations on intersecting runways which would be likely to produce a major capacity bottleneck affecting the air transportation system of the whole country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think far the most likely outcome, if not immediately then in the not too distant future, would be the worst case scenario I described earlier of the east-west being used mainly for intersection take-offs, enabling more heavy jet capacity on the north-south axis and a significant worsening of conditions for my constituents. I emphasise: this would mean an extra 10 to 20 heavy jet movements per hour, potentially, for those underneath the existing north-south runway&mdash;hardly a panacea. This point is now well understood by the more astute community activists. Just today the newly elected Mayor of Hunters Hill, Jane Waddell of the No Aircraft Noise Party, made exactly the same points as I have just made in an interview with the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program. Ms Waddell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I support any attempts to share the burden a little. But I think the east west runway is a double-edged sword. Because if you open the east west runway and take out all the small aircraft and put those down on the east west runway and then fill all the slots up here with lots of other planes, and then keep winding the capacity of the airport up, which is what's going to happen, our situation here will be that for a very short time we will have relief, and then the whole thing will start over again.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not just government ministers and members making this point. It is also significant, I think, that the coalition's transport spokesman, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), invoked the position of the regional airlines during the debate earlier today. What they have explicitly advocated is the very worst case scenario I have just described, together with a few other little nasties like allowing take-offs to the north from the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is my firm belief that the Sydney airport noise problem is easily the most important urban environmental issue in the country today. The bill we are debating might be said to be an incremental measure, but it is a very worthwhile one that will bring quite tangible benefits, and not a little reassurance to those affected. It is important that we seek genuine solutions through the early development of Sydney West airport and measures to ensure that it starts to take the burden off Kingsford Smith as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In her reply to a question without notice from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) last week, remarks by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) contained the outrageous claim that the Council for Civil Liberties in Western Australia was `in name only' and that `one of the travesties of Western Australian public life is that the Council for Civil Liberties is controlled by a group of very conservative people' who were secretive, hid the council's constitution and failed to publicise their meetings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister knows full well that the council is an incorporated body the constitution of which is a public document, and invites the public and all members of the Western Australian parliament to its annual general meeting as well as providing a service to the public 24 hours a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's reply was, of course, thoroughly in keeping with her totally disingenuous smokescreen of prevarications and irrelevancies in these matters. The minister wants us to accept that, to quote her own words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have taken little notice of any correspondence with the Council for Civil Liberties on matters affecting divorce law reform serious enough to raise them with both the Western Australian and Commonwealth Attorneys General.</PARA>
<PARA>What is even more astonishing is that she was, nevertheless, prepared to discuss with Mr Peter Weygers, himself a practising psychologist, her views on the psychology of Penny Easton's suicide in a letter dated 16 December 1992, not long after her death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's attack, by name, on Mr Peter Weygers, four times elected mayor of the town of Claremont, and a person who only a few days ago was nominated by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper as one of `Western Australia's most admired citizens', is typical of her stance throughout this sorry affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is ironic is that in denying any remembrance of a protracted correspondence with Mr Weygers, as president of the council, and of having knowledge of this Commonwealth parliament's divorce laws, the minister seems also to have forgotten that, as a divorced person herself, she must have had first-hand experience of divorce court procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more ironic, in view of her claim that she knew nothing of the law, is that her co-conspirator, Mr John Halden MLC, in what has become known as the Easton affair was immediately prior to his election to the parliament of Western Australia, and for six years, employed as an officer of the Family Court in Western Australia. He must have known he was using the privilege of parliament to break the law, by using false information about the Family Court proceedings to which Penny Easton could not reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in my possession copies of the letters which clearly demonstrate that the Minister for Human Services and Health had indeed been fully informed about the Council for Civil Liberties' campaign, against the secrecy provisions of section 121 of this Commonwealth parliament's Family Law Act of 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am ashamed that a fellow Western Australian should have made such a defamatory attack upon the Council for Civil Liberties and its public-spirited officers. Mr Speaker, I would like to assure you and the House that, contrary to what the minister said, the council's work and its support for the liberty of the individual is highly valued by all those in Western Australia with any respect for decency and honesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it almost impossible to believe, therefore, that the minister, a divorcee and a member of the very party which prides itself on having created a no-fault divorce procedure, and especially one that barred publicity, should now claim that she was unaware of the Family Law Act's secrecy provisions. It is beyond comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should end by paraphrasing Winston Churchill's famous remark about secrecy: `The greater the truth, the bigger the bodyguard of lies and deception needed to conceal it.' Here I think we have the answer to what lies at the heart of the Easton affair and the Minister for Human Services and Health. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight in the adjournment debate I want to pay tribute to the Australian volunteer coastguard movement. On the weekend of 12 to 13 August, the national AGM of the Australian Volunteer Coastguard Association was held in Cairns. I would like to thank the association for the hospitality extended to me by National Commodore Clark and his colleagues at the squadron dinner which was held on the Saturday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Volunteer Coastguard Association was first formed in 1961 in Victoria due to a defined need, moulded on the US Coastguard Auxiliary and adapted to suit the Australian scene. Since then, it has spread to all states except Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Some 90 per cent of Australia's population of 17.5 million live within 120 kilometres of the coast and over 70 per cent live in a coastal belt running from my electorate in Far North Queensland to Adelaide in South Australia, which is where the Australian Volunteer Coastguard Association is established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the largest single volunteer marine rescue and marine education organisation in Australia and indeed the Southern Hemisphere. Their total membership, including associate members, stands at approximately 11,700, with 2,514 being regular professional volunteers. There are 89 association owned rescue boats and 147 radio bases under the control of 63 flotillas, and expansion is continuing in areas of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coastguard association is a registered charity and a volunteer non-profit organisation. All members are dedicated professional volunteers who freely give up their spare time and vessels to provide the service. No member gets paid for what they do and funding is provided through the generosity of the public and private enterprise and in some states through state funding. A supplementary role is served in some areas by the water police. It has to be said that they regularly risk their lives to save others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth going through the objectives of the association, which are to promote safety in boating and the use of pleasure craft in the Commonwealth of Australia; to assist in the preservation of life and property of the members of the association and others; to assist persons on or adjacent to the waters of the Commonwealth of Australia who, as a result of misadventure or otherwise, have endangered their lives or the lives of others or who must conveniently be assisted by members of the association; to train members and the public in the use of seacraft and seamanship, first aid and resuscitation; and to train personnel capable of assisting in the defence of the Commonwealth of Australia upon the seas and elsewhere. In the latter, the association works in close cooperation with state and federal authorities, including Coastwatch and customs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate in particular the work of the Cairns coastguard flotilla and also the flotillas in Port Douglas and Thursday Island which are part of my electorate. The Cairns flotilla is now proudly led by Commodore Lucille Jackley and Vice-Commodore Lorelle Wilton. On the night of 12 August, life membership was awarded to Vice-Commodore Barry Crittenden of Cairns, to Frank Carter from Mourilyan, who was previously from Cairns, and posthumously to Bill McPherson of Sydney. The award of substantive rank was awarded to Max Griffin of the Port Douglas flotilla. I congratulate them for their long-term service to the community. Again, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Australian Volunteer Coastguard Association for the voluntary work that they do very well in protecting and saving lives on the Australian coast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to raise a subject that has been widely debated in the other place over recent weeks but which has been largely ignored in this place, other than by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), and that is China's program for nuclear tests. China should be of great concern to this parliament. Its human rights record has been appalling. At the moment it is managing to create a grotesque mixture of the worst aspects of state socialist dictatorship and unrestrained primitive capitalism. This is occurring against a background of political instability. China's economic development is strengthening regionalism and threatens Beijing's centralised dictatorship at a time when a succession crisis is building as the country's leaders await the death of Deng Xiaoping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chinese military is steadily becoming more assertive. According to official Chinese figures, military spending has increased by 200 per cent over the past seven years. There have been reports that some generals have called for Deng's designated successor, the State President and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiang Zemin, to stand down. China has displayed increasingly belligerent behaviour over the disputed Spratly Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just seen a particularly provocative series of missile tests off the coast of Taiwan. Its current series of nuclear tests appears to be part of this trend. Over the last few months much has been made of the fact that France tests its nuclear weapons in a colony, not on its own soil. It could be argued that China does much the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China's nuclear tests are carried out at Lop Nor in the province Xinjiang in the far west of the country. Xinjiang lies in the heart of central Asia. It borders Tibet in the south; Mongolia in the east; Kirgizistan in the north; and Pakistan, Afghanistan and India in the west. Xinjiang literally means `new territories' and the province has a distinct history of its own. Like much of central Asia, it is a heavily Muslim populated area. For much of this century it looked more towards the Soviet Union than China, and an independent East Turkistan Republic briefly existed in the 1940s and still serves as an inspiration for nationalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until the 1950s that firm attempts were made by Beijing to irreversibly integrate the region into the state, and the province was heavily colonised by Han Chinese. Efforts to collectivise agriculture have devastated the livelihoods of nomadic herders, traders and small scale farmers. The cultural revolution saw the destruction of many mosques, the burning of scriptures, persecutions of religious leaders and the suppression of any expression of nationalism and national customs seen as being separatist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormous discrepancy between the economic and educational wellbeing of people in Xinjiang and those living in China proper. Xinjiang has been used as a dumping ground for thousands of China's prison population and restrictive family planning policies are enforced, despite earlier promises from Beijing not to apply them to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern that Xinjiang's soil composition makes it an entirely unsuitable site for nuclear weapons testing. China's test program has had predictable health effects on the local population. It has also damaged the agricultural industries that boomed in the area and has devastated local water supplies. Despite this, the tests continue and, to further exacerbate the problem, the region is used as a dumping ground for nuclear waste. It should be no surprise that many disturbances have occurred in the area over the last 15 years with demonstrations, riots and full scale fighting claiming several hundred lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1992&mdash;less than a year after American intelligence had made the disturbing claim that it had been assisting Iran with the development of nuclear weapons, a claim repeated in the British press only last weekend. It has been claimed that China's test program is, in part, a protest against its lack of say when the treaty was originally formulated. China is keen to assert its power, not just in the region but on the world stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China cannot be ignored, as its nuclear program has shown, but it seems as if it is trying to elbow its way into a larger place at the world table. China must learn to adhere to the international norms other countries follow, and then China's rise may be a source of opportunity for other countries, not a source of danger. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 August last, the Health Insurance Commission closed the Medicare-Medibank office at Toukley in my electorate and moved it to Lake Haven Shopping Centre, some five kilometres away. That action has caused major disruptions and unnecessary inconvenience to many thousands of my constituents. The commission has overlooked the fact, I am quite sure, that Toukley is the major medical services centre of Wyong shire. It serves the people of Norah Head, Toukley, Noraville, Budgewoi, the areas north of there and the area of Gorokan in the adjoining electorate of Dobell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are more than 60 health professionals operating at Toukley. They include 30 full-time GPs, 10 visiting specialists, two specialist centres, two radiology centres, three sports medicine centres, four physiotherapists, a large pathology service&mdash;with one more to open soon&mdash;and an almost completed medical centre for 10 more specialists. Medicare's nearby location was convenient for those medical service centres. There is a choice of some seven pharmacists close at hand for people who have to use those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite objections from the Toukley chamber of commerce, the people of Toukley and adjoining areas, local health professionals, pharmacists, doctors, aged care professionals, petitions signed by over 2,200 people in the immediate area, representations to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), wide objections in the media and my own efforts on their behalf, the health commission went ahead with that decision to close down the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the commission did not think through the decision. It was not aware of the importance of Toukley Medical Centre and the fact that it was the major medical service centre in the Wyong shire. I think that they were made an offer that they found too good to refuse, an offer by the proprietors of the Lake Haven Shopping Centre, who see themselves threatened by an even bigger shopping centre coming up some kilometres down the highway at Westfield Tuggerah, just south of Wyong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The landlord of the Toukley premises, with a lease coming up for reconsideration, was not given the opportunity to make a matching offer. He was not given the opportunity to take part in any kind of negotiations or discussions. The commission has, by its action&mdash;ill-considered be it&mdash;disadvantaged some 13,000 people. Many of those people are on low incomes, many of them are sick, many of them are receiving some form of support and many of them with those disabilities find it difficult to use infrequent public transport to go from the area they are residing in down to Lake Haven Shopping Centre, go to Medicare, wait for the next bus service, come back and then go to the pharmacist or deal with the only pharmacist that is at the Lake Haven Shopping Centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public transport system between those areas that I have mentioned and Lake Haven, but particularly between Toukley and Norah Head and Noraville, my constituents assure me is not convenient for them. It is quite inconvenient, time consuming, uncomfortable and frustrating. I would have thought that they are matters that the commission is concerned about. Obviously, in this case they have made a decision and nothing is going to move them, or we are going to move them before we finish. Before we finish we want a Medicare-Medibank service of some form re-established at Toukley to meet the needs of the people. Medibank is optional, but Medicare is a service funded by taxpayers for all Australians and the convenience of that service ought to be a major consideration in the siting of those offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has made it very clear to me that she will continue to raise with the commission the arguments that I am putting to the chamber here tonight. It is obviously a decision made by people in Sydney who have not thought through, as I said earlier, what is involved. I realise that ministers in these areas do have an opportunity to give some indication, but it is not as easy as that. That is why we are pressing much harder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are continuing the campaign. I will continue to raise this with the minister and will continue to bring the attention of people to petitions and fresh petitions, which we bring back to this chamber. They are being organised by the Toukley Chamber of Commerce because we want to see the people who use Medicare and Medibank in the Toukley and adjoining areas get the service that they are properly entitled to. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see that the staff from AusAID realise the importance of national museums to a community. In their little pamphlet that they produced they said that the Australian people realise the importance of conserving the treasures of Cambodia for the children and future of the kingdom of Cambodia. It also said that, by assisting the royal government of Cambodia to repair the museum, Australia is also assisting Cambodia to rediscover its unique cultural heritage and present it to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This begs the question: if these things are so important that AusAID and the Australian government would assist in repairing a museum of another country, how is it that we fail to build a National Museum of Australia when it was one of the government's key cultural promises in the 1993 election? The 1995-98 corporate plan of the National Museum of Australia talks about building a gallery of Aboriginal Australia and developing specific venues, including old Parliament House and the Customs House in Sydney. It talks about communication technology strategies, but it does not talk about a permanent home for the collections that display our history and the `unique cultural heritage and present it to the rest of the world'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is another broken promise from this government. It is a broken plan. It ignores the work of several different councils. The council which has a maximum number of 12 members currently only has five I believe. There is no funding. There is no funding in the forward estimates for the National Museum of Australia and one can only begin to believe that it has no future at all. The government admits the importance of national museums when speaking about the National Museum of Cambodia and, indeed, spends money overseas. </PARA>
