<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on yet another instalment in this big spending government's economic negligence. These additional appropriations total $1,416 million&mdash;that is, $1.4 billion&mdash;in more spending. This ever rising spending is offset to a degree by savings worth $499 million, leaving new spending of $917 million in 1995-96. Where are all these extra taxpayers' funds going? An increase in running costs accounts for $433 million. So the cost of running government has increased by 3.5 per cent. The government assured us in the last budget that they were for tight, efficient government. Their budget papers show that they took $161 million in savings from running costs in the 1995-96 budget. In the space of six months they have not only spent the savings on increased running costs but exceeded them by $272 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other areas of expenditure include $46 million for defence facilities, $25 million for computer equipment in the Department of Social Security, $69 million for a loan to Papua New Guinea and $25 million for the development of the Homebush site in Sydney. Government spending seems to keep going ever onward and upward. I quote from the 1995-96 budget speech by the Treasurer (Mr Willis):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A higher level of national savings will allow higher levels of development and economic growth without the costs and constraints associated with undue reliance on foreign savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This budget provides a two part plan to improve Australia's saving performance, immediately and over the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, it increases public savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget delivers a surplus in 1995-96 of $718m.</PARA>
<PARA>No, it does not. It does not deliver that sort of surplus. Here we are, six months out from the budget, back firmly into deficit&mdash;the government's preferred position. The new spending alone will more than swamp the phoney surplus of the government. When you take into account the flip-flop on the AIDC sale and the ANL debacle, the budget is well and truly in deficit. By the government's own admission this will reduce national savings and place pressure on foreign debt. I can only assume therefore that, now the budget is over and the government has exhausted the media grabs on the surplus, it is happy to pursue a big spending deficit strategy. Let us also bear in mind the question of how this will be paid for. The government has made it clear many times that they do not see scope for significant savings. This only leaves revenue&mdash;that is, more taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truly frightening thing about all of this extra spending is that there is more to come. We have not even had from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) his innovation/housing/social policy/something for everyone policy. It is yet to be announced; it will probably be in December. It has sunk beneath the waves, despite the huge price tag. There will undoubtedly be more promises during the election campaign. Things like extending Medicare or better tax treatment for pensioners will be trotted out again as throwaway lines. There will be more glib assurances about the government being able to pay for it without increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you do not cut spending, the only way you can pay for it is by lifting taxes. On this side of the House, we are clear: we will cut spending. On the other side of the House, based on their record, they will lift taxes. It is 1992-93 all over again: promise the world, with no idea how you are going to pay for it and, if you cheat your way back into office, then you lift taxes and break your promises. New tax measures, such as widening the wholesale sales tax net, death duties&mdash;the darling of the Left&mdash;and those sorts of things will be dusted off again and trotted out to pay the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot even be said that all of the expenditure is in the national interest. I refer to the item which relates to the funding in the budget papers for the legal expenses for Dr Carmen Lawrence. It has already been found by the royal commissioner that Dr Lawrence did not tell the truth with regard to matters surrounding the Easton royal commission. The coalition will be requiring some changes to Appropriation Bill (No. 4) pertaining to Dr Lawrence's legal expenses. The coalition is not prepared to give a blank cheque to the government to use taxpayers' funds to fund political campaigns by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving amendments to the bill to reduce the appropriation by that amount used to fund the challenges to the royal commission. The coalition will not agree to the funding of legal expenses of challenges to that royal commission. While we will agree to the funding of the legal costs of Dr Lawrence appearing before the royal commission, we will not allow taxpayers' funds to be used for a political campaign designed to stop the royal commission. This was simply an attempt to use taxpayers' funds to stop a lawfully convened royal commission and stop the political embarrassment to this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear on behalf of the coalition that we will not be a party to an ALP inspired campaign to shut down the royal commission and we will not allow taxpayers' funds to be used for that purpose, purely for political reasons. The government has a long history in this regard, be it sports rorts or stopping independent investigations into the government's propaganda unit, NMLS. The government is always seeking to stop negative reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about the lack of detail in what appears to be another expensive legal exercise relating to former minister Alan Griffiths. While the government has advised that it will provide this information during the day, if the coalition does not have this information by the end of the debate on this subject we will be moving an amendment to reject this amount also. The government clearly sees spending as a way of solving problems. I repeat that on the Carmen Lawrence matter we will not allow taxpayers' funds to be used for the political purposes of shutting down the royal commission and that, even knocking off the amount contained within the limited information we have, we are still not satisfied with the costings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation amount is not an authority to pay the amount; it is purely an indication that the funds are there, although we are advised that there are extra bills to come in in relation to this matter. So it was a very expensive exercise by the government. Our view all along has been that, if Dr Lawrence had merely fronted the commission and told what she knew, there would not have been a need for all this unbelievable expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the matter of Alan Griffiths, we are concerned that the amount has no detail whatsoever. For that reason, we have asked the government to provide that detail. They have indicated that they will give that detail by the end of the day. If we are satisfied with the detail of that account, it can go through, but if we are not or we do not receive it we will be moving to delete that item as well. While the government has advised that they will provide that information, I reiterate that our concern is that we have no detail as to what it was for and how much it goes to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the government sees spending as a way out of all its problems. Even for 1995-96, when the government was making a big noise about tightening the budget, spending grew by 1.7 per cent in real terms. This government just does not know anything else. We still have many problems as a nation. For example, our waterfront has gone backwards. Despite government spending of more than $140 million of taxpayers' funds, the performance of our waterfront is abysmal. Our waterfront charges are amongst the highest in the world and two-thirds of it is attributed to the high cost of our terminal operations. It is now cheaper to move materials through New Zealand, Singapore or Britain than through Australia. It is not as if it is a close race; we are considerably more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government continues to rest on its laurels and tell us how much they have reformed the waterfront. As if that is not bad enough, the number of containers moved per hour has actually fallen. It has not just stayed the same, which would have been bad enough; it has fallen. If you use an Australian port, it takes longer and costs more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the measures in the new appropriation bills is $39 million for Australian National, which stems from the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. What is the state of Australian rail after all these reforms the government trumpeted? Australian rail freight rates, with the exception of general freight, are much higher than best practice international levels. In coal, one of Australia's most important exports, rail freight rates are up to five times the lowest average rate in the US. Not only do they cost more; they are also unreliable. National Rail arrived on time only 61 per cent of the time. Competing truck operators arrived on time 96 per cent of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has much lower labour productivity than the US. AN was outperformed by Burlington Northern in the US by a factor of 3.6. This is not a coalition throwaway line; it comes from the government's own Bureau of Industry Economics document. I wonder how long it will be before these reports are stopped. It is easy to simply shoot the messenger; that is the government's way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point of our farmers, miners and manufacturers striving for world best practice if they lose it the minute they have to access the Australian transport system. It is not good enough. We need real reform, not simply having money thrown around like it is going out of fashion. Yet the approach taken by Labor is to throw money at it and call it a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health is an another significant problem in this area. We used to have a health system that was the envy of many nations around the world. We had a healthy balance between private and public health. We now have a private health system in crisis and a public health system under ever-growing pressure. What is the government's response? Increase the Medicare levy and raise spending on public health. Has this stopped the decline in private health? No, it has not. The private health sector is in continuing decline, and the public health system is under increasing pressure. Once again, the government has refused to tackle the hard decisions. Once again, it has failed to find a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is another case in point. Since the recession we did not have to have, the government has thrown billions of dollars at various infrastructure and labour market programs. We were told that it would take us until the new age of prosperity to solve our current account problems and lower unemployment. So where are we now? For a start, we have record foreign debt of $180 billion. We are now five years into economic recovery and we still have over eight per cent unemployment. In fact, unemployment is going up again. It now stands at 8.7 per cent, or 788,000 unemployed Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long-term unemployment, the very rationale for the Working Nation statement, has gone up 10,000 since April this year and stands at 252,500 people. This is a damning indictment of failed policies. What is the government's response? The economy is just catching its breath. If it catches its breath much more, it will turn blue and catch a cold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government continually forgets that if you do not get the fundamentals right you will not get the numbers right over the medium or longer term. One of the most important fundamentals is budgetary policy. This is the first thing that the government should be focusing on. Instead of confronting the issue of excessive spending, the government has continued to lift taxes. This has included higher company tax, despite the fact that it will adversely affect our international competitiveness. It has also included an attempt to impose more taxes on the building industry, despite the fact that the housing industry is in the middle of a deep and prolonged slump. This continuation of excessive spending has meant a run of excessively large deficits. It has drained our national savings at a time when we should focus all our energy on lifting national savings. These bills simply continue in that vein. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This appalling performance on national savings has meant greater reliance on foreign liabilities, which has given us a spiralling net income deficit. This has placed us in the precarious position that when we get anything like reasonable growth we get a current account blow-out. Because the government refuses to confront national savings, the government is forced into the position of having to slow growth as the means of reducing the current account deficit. Of course, if you slow growth you get unemployment problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no possibility of getting to five per cent unemployment by the end of the decade under government policies, and the government knows it. The government criticises us for daring to say this, but just saying you will get there will not make it happen. The coalition is simply recognising that under failed Labor policies the unemployed have been very badly let down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tell us this with their own economic growth forecasts, which, by their own admission, will not generate sufficient employment growth. Unfortunately, the wheels are well and truly starting to come off the government's economic wagon. We now have the worst results&mdash;rising unemployment, rising inflation, rising foreign debt and slower growth&mdash;and still the government tell us it is all going to plan. Which part of the plan is going okay? I certainly cannot find the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem with these bills is that they add further to the already excessive stocks of government debt by ensuring we are back to a deficit. Already the government spends $9.4 billion in interest for past debt, and this figure rises to $9.5 billion in the 1996-97 budget year. This extra spending will simply place further debt burdens on our future generations, and the fact that there is even more Keating election spending in the pipeline will only make matters worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of spending money on hospitals, roads or education, future generations will be paying billions to financial markets every year. Because of this government's policies, we are passing a terrible legacy to our children: a government increasingly in debt and a nation heavily in debt to foreign savers. All the often repeated government promises about economic nirvana just around the corner will not change this. But perhaps the most frustrating thing about these bills is that the government will simply not learn from past mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been down this road before. All during 1994 the government was told it was spending too much and the deficit was too large. It was told that it would put enormous pressure on the current account deficit and interest rates. The Prime Minister ignored it all and we got tax hikes, increased interest rates and the worst current account deficit in the OECD. Finally this message got through to the Prime Minister and we got the 1995-96 budget with its fudge-it surplus. But now it has all been forgotten and the government is back to more spending and more negligent policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the problems have not gone away, they are just hidden by the falling economic growth. We still have a structurally unsound current account deficit, which will again blow out when growth gets strong enough. We still rely far too heavily on foreign savers to support our investment. What a terrible position to be in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only get good current account numbers when the economy is slowing down and the unemployment rate is going up. The government should be learning from its past mistakes and putting us on a more sustainable growth path. It should be cutting spending and lifting savings and it should be pushing ahead with economic reform, most particularly in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now, at a time when the government should be seeking to secure our future, it is squibbing on the tough decisions. At a time when it should be putting all effort into lifting national savings, it is increasing spending. At a time when it should be taking pressure off inflation, it is increasing spending. At a time when it should be taking pressure off the tax system, it is lifting spending. At a time when it should be consolidating the budget to prepare for any future downturn, it is increasing spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the government should be pushing ahead with reform of the labour market, they are defending a system which allows national strikes to punish one company. At a time when they should be reforming the Industrial Relations Act, they are putting their head in the sand and pretending that there is no problem. At a time when they should lift the performance of our infrastructure, they fall back on the endless tales of past half-reform while our waterfront goes backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has shown time and time again that it is not capable of making the decisions which are necessary to secure this country's future. These further big spending bills are just the most recent manifestation of this fact. It is only a coalition government which will be able to take the responsible decisions. The government would have you believe that there are no more cuts in spending to be made. What it really means is that it no longer has the will to make the tough decisions on spending. It will take a coalition government to make the necessary decisions on running a responsible budget. It will be a budget that balances the legitimate needs of protecting the vulnerable members of our society, but it will not be featured by rampaging spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will ensure that the budget is kept responsible by ensuring that all spending is both efficient and effective. Programs which are wasteful or redundant will be wound back or abolished in favour of programs which better achieve their goals, but we will not be raising taxes or increasing new taxes. We are quite clear on that. This is a commitment that the government is not prepared to make. It is by taking measures such as these that we will improve the structural position of the budget and so reduce the call of the Commonwealth on savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rebuilding national savings is a top priority for any coalition government. The conservative states are doing their bit to lift national savings. It is only the Commonwealth which is not putting anything into this national effort. That will change under a coalition government. We must make it a top priority to reduce spending and to lift national savings. This is of fundamental importance in placing Australia on a sustainable growth path. It is only through sustained, higher levels of growth that we will start to make real inroads into the crippling level of unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government have shown that they are not prepared to do the hard yards when it comes to running responsible budgets. They have shown that they are not prepared to do the hard yards when it comes to doing their share to lift national savings. They talk about the superannuation guarantee levy, but that is legislating to make people save. It is not the Commonwealth making the adjustments. The states are doing it. The Commonwealth is making everyone else do it, yet the Commonwealth cannot seem to lift its own savings performance. One again, it is passing the buck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government are old and tired and they need a rest. I am sure they are going to get it at the next election. Indeed, the country needs a rest from their policies. They should stop putting off the inevitable and let the Australian people decide to chart a new course for the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always interesting to follow the opposition spokesman on finance, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), and to compare him with the strength of the Minister for Finance, Mr Kim Beazley. It really does show the difference between these two teams when you compare the frontbench of the government with the poor excuse for a frontbench of the opposition. I often think that we could probably put up a second 11 on this side and still run rings around them. The performance of the member for Forrest today showed once again that he has no idea of what government is all about. That is why at the next election the coalition will be relegated again to the opposition benches. That is about the best place for them in this place, if there is any place for them here at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly gives me great pleasure to speak on a more positive note in support of the bills before the House today: Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1995-96 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1995-96. There can be little doubt that this government's commitment strategy over the past three years has secured a strong, sustainable economic recovery in this country, despite what the gloom and doom merchants on the opposition benches have been saying and have again reinforced here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time, our gross domestic product growth is approximately 3.75 per cent, which is in line with budget forecasts and above the OECD average. Buttressing these figures, the underlying rate of inflation is remaining steady at about three per cent, wages growth has been to a large degree offset by productivity increases under enterprise bargaining and interest rates have remained steady since last year. I will come to the topic of interest rates later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these factors are combined with increased business investment, which is expected to be around 13 per cent this fiscal year, the economic environment remains relatively rosy compared with the last time those opposite sat on the treasury bench.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given what we know of the opposition's industrial relations policy to date&mdash;the member for Forrest has reinforced their industrial relations policy again today, which of course is nil; it is a confrontation type of policy&mdash;it would seem that the Leader of the Opposition has learned nothing about responsible economic management over the past 12 years. One would have thought that, after his miserable representation up to 1983, he would have spent the last 12 years trying to learn something, or at least listening to others, but he obviously has learnt nothing or must be just a slow learner. It may pay members opposite, therefore, to sit back and listen as I outline a few points about how this Labor government has effectively been delivering a fiscally responsible budget which is expanding economic and employment growth. It is a very important area to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members would be well aware, the 1995-96 budget will deliver a surplus this financial year, which is a $12 billion turnaround in the budget outcome. This is being achieved by a net reduction in outlays, increases in revenue and the sale of government assets. Importantly, the 1996-97 budget will be in surplus excluding asset sales, and the 1997-98 budget is expected to show a surplus of $7.4 billion, or 1.2 per cent of GDP, based on the government's fiscal tightening measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complementing these fiscal tightening measures, the government has also moved to tackle the decline in national savings in order to facilitate higher levels of investment and economic growth in the future. Once again, the member for Forrest has gone on off on some other wavelength about that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1997, variations to industrial awards will see the introduction of employee contributions to superannuation schemes funded out of future wage rises. Contributions amounting to three per cent of average weekly earnings will be phased in over the next three years. To complement the three per cent phased employee superannuation contributions, the government will match employee contributions dollar for dollar with direct payments to workers' superannuation accounts. The second round of the One Nation tax cuts will be paid in this form. That once again shows this government's commitment to increasing savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matching payments, which will be capped at three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings and means tested, will gradually withdraw support up to a salary in the range of $65,000 per annum. By the year 2006, the impact of the government's superannuation measures will be boosting national savings by an estimated two per cent of GDP. Not only will this dramatically increase the pool of savings available for investment purposes and reduce our reliance on foreign capital, but also it will boost workers' retirement incomes substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget's two-pronged approach to the continued expansion of the Australian economy underpins the government's other key objectives of employment growth. Everyone in this place should think that is a key priority. We on this side of the House certainly do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's commitment to ensuring that all Australians benefit from the economic progress of the last three years has been paramount in the formation of the 1995-96 budget. To this end, the government has committed $2.2 billion in this budget to create jobs for the long-term unemployed,  jobs for disadvantaged people and jobs for youth&mdash;in short, jobs for people who have been the most seriously affected by the economic contraction of the early 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget appropriation and the innovative labour market programs which stem from it come from the government's comprehensive Working Nation white paper on employment and growth. That has been one of the most important initiatives by this government over recent times. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) for his support and initiative and for his commitment to Working Nation. It is certainly an outstanding paper which is delivering to many of the people who need that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Working Nation initiatives are, without doubt, one of the most ambitious and well thought out plans to reduce unemployment this country has ever seen. The strategies derived from Working Nation have been instrumental in helping large numbers of unemployed people obtain meaningful and dignified employment since its inception in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Working Nation, the unemployment rate in seasonally adjusted terms has fallen from its peak in October 1993 of 11 per cent to 8.7 per cent as of October 1995. Whilst that still remains too high, we on this side of the House are committed to continuing to work to reduce those figures. But in the period since Working Nation came into operation in 1994, well over 330,000 jobs have been created as a direct result. I think you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is an impressive effort in just over one year of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On average, this government has created in excess of 20,000 jobs per month under the Working Nation program. Looking at the period since the Keating government was re-elected in 1993, almost 665,000 jobs have been created, which exceeds the government's commitment to create 500,000 jobs over three years&mdash;and this is well within two years, of course. It is a remarkable achievement, to say the least, and of course the government should be congratulated for that effort and for its commitment to a very difficult position in our community today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thinking about unemployment, one really needs to think about how it has been created. I was speaking to someone earlier this morning about the international situation of unemployment. Although the international situation is not consistent with the position in Australia, the movement in new technology over the past 10 to 20 years has had a major effect on employment. It is something that the whole world has to grapple with and it is something to which this government is giving a very high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some of the initiatives in my own electorate of Oxley, which I am very proud to represent in this place. Unfortunately we have areas of significantly high unemployment, but they have directly benefited from the Working Nation job creation initiatives. Many people are working in our community to take advantage of those opportunities provided in Working Nation. I take this opportunity to congratulate all those people associated with these initiatives to ensure that the people who are disadvantaged receive the greatest assistance possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our regional area consultative committee, which, naturally, as the local federal member I helped to establish when Working Nation first came out, is chaired by Mr Reg Bond, who works with his team of people. From time to time I also attend the meetings of that committee, along with the regional manager of DEET, to keep in touch with what is actually happening with the area consultative committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of an area consultative committee was something that I very strongly supported. It was a very important initiative. It has been particularly successful in delivering labour market programs to the long-term unemployed. All the people who sit around that table are local people who make a very worthwhile contribution. Of course, we need to continue to maintain the emphasis on that area consultative committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACC, as it is known, is a very representative body made up of local employers, unions, community groups, local government agencies, education providers and members from the business community. Those providers have developed an innovative network to deliver those new work opportunity programs and landcare and environment action programs in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also attend a lot of the graduation ceremonies at the completion of a lot of those labour market initiatives for the unemployed people who have been in these programs and inspect the work that they are undertaking. I speak with the participants and see the work that they have carried out. It always gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the benefits that they are receiving and the opportunities that are opening up for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Participants in these programs gain a sense of purpose and hope, while at the same time developing skills which will benefit them in the labour marketplace. The benefits in terms of greater community cohesion can also be overlooked in this context. Above all these benefits, however, the number of people going on from these labour market programs to full-time employment is the most rewarding and pleasing aspect to me as their local federal member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the efforts of the ACC, and of course DEET through the CES in my electorate, substantial inroads have been made into the long-term unemployment rate in the region with a five per cent reduction since the peak period in late 1993. To supplement the work of the ACC and the CES in the area of employment growth in the Ipswich region, we have also embraced the concept of a regional economic development organisation, which of course is known as a REDO. The local Ipswich regional development organisation is the body that has sort of kicked that off and is the forerunner of it, but we will be leading into the fully-fledged REDO in the very near future. That is another fine initiative that comes through in the Working Nation paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, we are currently in the process of forming a broad-based inclusive management committee for the REDO along the lines of the very successful ACC. The REDO will provide the vision and leadership required to tap the as yet unrealised potential in our regional industries to stimulate economic and employment growth. Once a REDO is up and running, it will complement the existing labour market programs already in place within my electorate and work towards creating an economic environment that is required to ensure expanding job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure many of these initiatives are being taken right throughout the length and breadth of Australia. As a matter of fact, I have been invited by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Simon Crean, to speak on his behalf at a function at Indooroopilly in Brisbane in the federal electorate of Ryan to acknowledge the contribution of lots of people who are participating there. That is on 2 December, and I am very much looking forward to the opportunity to once again highlight the initiatives of the Working Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt, though, that the government is well on the way to achieving its objective of a five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000. The government, of course, realises that to achieve this target rate lots of modifications to existing programs are required to meet the changing needs of the unemployed. We must, as time moves on, always be prepared to change to meet the current needs, and of course this government has always been prepared to do that. That is why it has been so successful over the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, within the resource funding envelope which has been set aside for Working Nation programs in the budget, a great deal of flexibility has been built in to ensure resources can be directed to the areas of greatest need, and that is important. This fact is reflected in the second year enhancements to the Working Nation programs announced by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Simon Crean, on 19 October this year. These enhancements emerge from extensive consultations through the consultative infrastructure of Working Nation which encompasses the ACC network, NETTFORCE industry training companies, youth groups and, of course, the CES. The four key messages to emerge from these consultations were the need for the simplification of programs available under Working Nation; earlier and more flexible access to programs; more effective assistance for youth; and the need to expand and broaden the new case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the enhancements that the minister has put in place have built upon these messages, and include an extra 28,000 places for contracted case managers; an additional 250 staff in the CES to enhance service to job seekers; a strategy to improve communication with young Australians; a greatly simplified wage subsidy regime for jobstart, traineeships and apprenticeships; the extension of wage subsidy coverage to include people unemployed for six to 12 months; wage subsidy eligibility extended to cover the employment of long-term unemployed job seekers as apprentices; and an up-front lump sum payment for employers who take on more than two eligible employees under jobstart or apprenticeships, provided at least a quarter are from the job compact group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a moment, I will emphasise the importance of the participation of the business community in employment. I acknowledge the contribution of lots of businesses, particularly small businesses who always struggle no matter what the case may be because they really are people who have to be hands on all the time. They do not have the benefit of having huge staff numbers such as big companies do. I congratulate them for participating, and I encourage them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday night I had the opportunity to speak at my local Master Builders Association annual dinner and Christmas party. They always get in early to start their celebrations. The building area really is a very important area in any local community; they should be involved in ensuring that they take the opportunity available to them under Working Nation. I am trying to encourage more people from the building industry to actually get involved in our ACC because I believe they have a very big commitment to make. They are already making a very big commitment with apprentices and in creating employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These enhancements which I have just highlighted will certainly provide a boost to organisations in my electorate, such as IMCAS, the Ipswich-Moreton community apprenticeship scheme, one of the local apprenticeship groups. It is a very successful scheme. I congratulate them on their efforts. They will benefit, and their efforts will continue to provide training and job opportunities to the long-term unemployed. I have had the opportunity of using their services to employ a trainee in my own office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplification of the wage subsidy regime when combined with up-front lump sum payments for employers who take on trainees and apprentices will certainly make participants in that IMCAS program more attractive to local employers who are considering taking on long-term unemployed job seekers. There can be little doubt that the funds appropriated for Working Nation programs under the 1995-96 budget will continue to make large inroads in coming years into solving the unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Working Nation achieving the sorts of results I mentioned earlier, it is hard to imagine what is motivating the opposition's determination to cut funding for these programs. That is what it is contemplating. The member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in a press conference on 20 June this year, made it quite plain what the opposition intends to do with Working Nation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I've already told you what we think, that in relation to many of the Working Nation programs that there's room for savings. I've said that all along. I said it when it came down. I've already told you that in relation to Commonwealth duplication there is enormous room for savings . . . But the thing is, you see, you've got to have a will to do this.</PARA>
<PARA>This callous disregard for those who already have benefited and will benefit from these employment programs in the future is frightening to say the least. Australians, when they are considering the next election, which is not all that far away, should know that that is the sort of attitude the opposition has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments made by Mr Costello also expose the opposition leader's hypocritical and cynical pretence of helping out the so-called battlers. Considering that many battlers are utilising Working Nation programs, it is pretty difficult to see how slashing these programs is going to help them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear to all Australians that, when election time comes, there will be a stark choice between the government and the opposition on this issue. On one side you will have a federal Labor government committed to assisting the unemployed and providing an adequate social safety net, and on the other side you will have a coalition party dominated by ideologues who are intent on removing this assistance in the name of smaller government. A stark choice indeed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish by rejecting this out-of-hand nonsense amendment put forward by the member for Forrest. Once again, he is just attacking the Minister for Human Services and Health, Carmen Lawrence. After the opposition's performance here yesterday and the whole saga of the Marks royal commission, it is clear that this has just been a political witch-hunt by those opposite with consultation between the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of Western Australia.

Those battlers do not get the opportunity to have a Queen's Counsel being paid $5,000 a day. Five thousand dollars a day was paid to Mr Gyles to represent Carmen Lawrence, plus another barrister was paid at $2,000 a day for 90 days.

It was interesting that, when the Prime Minister before he became Prime Minister took action against Mrs Rosemary Foot in a highly political action, she paid her own fees. Yet here we have the Minister for Human Services and Health who, not acting in her federal capacity at all, sought to close down a royal commission inquiring into whether she had lied and connived at the introduction of a petition saying that perjury had been committed by a young woman who had just been admitted to the bar, when knowing that that was not true and could have been found to be knowing it was not true but believing it would be of political advantage to her because she&mdash;that is, Carmen Lawrence&mdash;knew that on that particular day the petition was brought in there was to be an announcement made that $5,000 of taxpayers' money had been kept by Carmen Lawrence in her personal bank account. </PARA>

She knew that this announcement was to be made and thought that by bringing in a petition she could, firstly, embarrass Richard Court and, secondly, divert attention from the fact that she had cynically kept taxpayers' money, hoping that she was not to be prosecuted, but at this stage not knowing whether or not she would be prosecuted by the DPP in the same manner as Brian Burke had been. In this cynical way this petition was brought in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of admitting to it, she chose&mdash;as the royal commission has found&mdash;to lie to the parliament and say that she had no knowledge of the petition prior to its tabling in the parliament. Yesterday, we had the situation where the Speaker ruled out of order a question asking the health minister why it was that 14 of her former colleagues had conspired to tell lies about her when she was the only one telling the truth. No answer was given to that question. Quite clearly, anyone reading the report of the royal commission knows that the health minister is guilty as found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the question of the behaviour in which she indulged with the complicity, connivance and approval of the government of the day. I refer to the Prime Minister and his cabinet. They said that the health minister's fees would be paid by the taxpayer. We then had some questions about how that was to be done. I canvassed with the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) whether or not he would seek to make a payment out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance by way of an act of grace payment under section 34A of the Audit Act. After blustering his way through the answer he finally said that the government would probably have to bring in a separate appropriation bill for this amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage nobody in their wildest dreams thought that it was going to come in at $800,000. Understand that the whole royal commission cost $3 million. As disclosed by the Attorney-General's Department, the minister for health's personal bill for legal fees is $856,000. We have seen no breakdown as to how much of those costs was incurred in an attempt to close down the royal commission and how much of those costs was incurred in her appearance before the royal commission. It is important that we be given those details because there is no way in the world that the taxpayers should be asked to pick up a bill for an attempt to close down a properly constituted royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the breakdown of the figures it is interesting to see that the minister for health chose to engage solicitors in Sydney. Former Senator Stephen Loosley&mdash;the former secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales who entered into that disastrous arrangement that lost the branch of the party so much money and plummeted it to nearly $10 million in debt&mdash;is a consultant with the firm that was engaged by the minister for health. The minister's barrister, Mr Gyles, was also a Sydney based lawyer. Aside from being a bit of an insult to the lawyers who practise in her home state, it also meant that the bill shows travel expenses of $48,293, accommodation of $40,643, facsimiles of over $3,000, couriers of over $2,800, telephone calls of $1,200 and photocopying alone of $18,000. </PARA>

There was a local lawyer in Perth who was deemed fit to be an agent for $40,000 and other disbursements amounting to over $115,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long and the short of it is that this sort of money from the taxpayer can only be afforded by people who are prepared to pay for Rolls Royce treatment when they can afford to pay for it. Regarding whether or not the minister for health made any decisions about that, I heard her say that it was not her problem. I find that a very curious statement to make. She is the person who sought out these people to represent her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the statement made in the letter by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to Senator Barney Cooney on 14 November which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document gives details requested, except in relation to a full break-up of costs as between the royal commission and the legal challenges to the royal commission&mdash;that is, the distinction between the amount of money paid for proper representation before the commission and the amount of money paid to try to close down the royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA>That information must be available and I think it is incumbent upon the Attorney-General to make it available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look again at the second appropriation&mdash;that is, legal fees of $550,000 to be paid in respect of the former minister for the investigation of his behaviour involved in the so-called sandwich shop affair. I find it very interesting that that appropriation is sought to be put in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) which is effectively a bill of supply. Indeed, under section 53 of our constitution, that bill provides money for the ordinary annual services of government. Money that needs to be appropriated for new and unauthorised expenditure is supposed to be in Appropriation Bill (No. 4), which is not a supply bill and is capable of amendment. It is important to note that the appropriation for the minister for health is contained within Appropriation Bill (No. 4), but the appropriation for Mr Griffiths, the former minister, is in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked and I found that in August this year there was tabled in the Senate a notification and backup documents of the decision to pay to the said former minister $150,000 on account of the costs to be paid to Brereton and Co., the solicitors he engaged, out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Under the Audit Act, you may not make a payment greater than $50,000 out of the advance unless there is a committee of departmental secretaries established to deal with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are entitled to know the details of that deliberation, otherwise there is no good reason at all as to why this appropriation of $550,000&mdash;an extraordinary amount for legal fees&mdash;is contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and why $150,000 of that amount was paid from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The answer that the government will probably give is that because it was paid out of the advance it is entitled to put it in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). That answer will not wash at all. The fact of the matter is that it is not the method of payment that counts, it is the reason for the payment that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the function of covering those fees, clearly the former minister is in a slightly different position from the health minister because the trouble he got into was while he was a minister of this parliament and his actions pertained to him being a minister of this parliament. Therefore, it has a relevance to this parliament. But $550,000 is a lot for taxpayers to pay and this parliament is entitled to a justification as how and why those costs were incurred at such a rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the question of the $800,000 proposed appropriation for the minster for health, the distinction I made is an important one. I used the term `slight'. The term `slight' can refer to the difference in the amount of money that is made available&mdash;a difference of some $250,000. But the whole action which was the subject of the royal commission in Western Australia was taken by the present minister for health whilst she was the Premier of Western Australia. Any logical person looking at it would think that it had no relevance to this parliament, except that, should she be found in the early stages of the debate to have been guilty of lying, then she was not a fit and proper person to hold office in this parliament. That is indeed the argument that the Solicitor-General used in supporting after the event, not before the event, a decision of the cabinet that they would pay the fees and the legal expenses of the minster for health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Solicitor-General made the point that the only reason this parliament could appropriate money for the taxpayer to pay the legal fees of the minster for health was that the royal commission in Western Australia was determining whether or not the minster for health was a fit and proper person to hold office in this parliament. That is a very important point. What we have seen is a stonewalling by the Prime Minister and by the minister herself to accept those findings and to accept that the proper behaviour in a Westminster system is for that minister to resign. If that minister will not resign, then the Prime Minister should sack her. That, very simply, is the Westminster system and it has been observed in the breach; in other words, it has not been followed as it should be. Thus, we have here in the parliament a continuance of the debate on the affairs of the minster for health. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people will all know that, if $800,000 of their money were used in an appropriation for the minister's own department, it could result in perhaps greater attention being given to an immunisation policy, greater accent being given to the mental health program, and assistance to rural and regional Australians who miss out on so many services. That money could be put to a use which Australian people would well approve of. But they are being asked to pay $800,000 of their hard earned money to support a person who firstly tried to close down a properly constituted royal commission and then refuses to abide by any of the findings. She will not come before this House and explain why it is that 14 of her previous colleagues&mdash;her own colleagues; not members of the Liberal Party, not members of the National Party but members of the Labor Party and people who were staff&mdash;have given testimony which shows that the minister chose to lie. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to note in this debate on the Appropriation bills how the double standards and hypocrisy of the opposition have finally caught up with it. This is the same opposition which, for the last three or four months in public debate throughout the country, has been saying that the government should not fund the legal fees of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) because the Marks royal commission is not relevant to her duties in the health portfolio. Now we have the extraordinary proposition from the opposition in this debate that it will move an amendment to cover a good part of the fees. It is now trying to argue that the findings of the Marks royal commission are directly relevant to the minister for health in the execution of her portfolio responsibilities in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

That was the argument they put forward. Now, when they look fondly upon the bodgie findings of that royal commission, they want to mount the counterargument. They have done a total somersault; they are now saying that the minister should resign because the findings of the royal commission are relevant to her duties as minister for health in this place. </PARA>

That is the standard he has set. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who will not be judged on his own past in this parliament, or on his own performance and his own public record in this parliament. He is establishing the framework by which the Liberal Party will go to the people with policies in which it does not believe. In the end, a party must run on ideology, conviction, policy and fundamental political belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties in 1995 are in a sorry, empty state. They are basically saying that what they believe in and feel strongly about in politics were all part of the Fightback manifesto. The things in which the coalition believe in the 1990s, reflected in Fightback, are unelectable. So now their strategy for 1996 is to put to the people the things they do not believe in. No wonder its members have that hang dog look about them. They are half excited that they are ahead in the opinion polls. They also have that hang dog look because they are going to the people with things they do not believe in. This is a coalition without a soul, a purpose or a meaning.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of the development of Fox studios at the Sydney showground which has been raised in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1995-96. No-one should be surprised by the allocation of funds in this regard by the appropriation bills. It should come as no surprise because several years ago it was announced that the showground would be relocating to Homebush Bay in Sydney. It should come as no surprise because two years ago, when Sydney secured the Olympics for the year 2000, it was confirmed that the showground would be relocating to Homebush Bay. It should come as no surprise because, just 12 months ago in Creative Nation, the Prime Minister announced that Fox had agreed to establish its studios in Sydney. So everyone has known about the decision making process for a number of years. We have also known that the showground is in a shabby state. The site is asbestos ridden and there is a need to restore the land to some proper condition before it can be disposed for an alternative use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The redevelopment of the site by Fox represents the cheapest option available to the taxpayers. That is the  evidence contained in the 1993 report prepared for the Fahey Liberal government in New South Wales by engineering consultants Norman Disney &amp; Young. This report put the cost of restoring the site for use by the Royal Agricultural Society as a showground at $90 million. Alternatively, the cost of demolishing the showground area and converting it to parkland would be $50 million, with additional annual maintenance costs required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the agreement struck with Fox by the Carr government in New South Wales, the public expenditure will be just $32 million to clean up the site. The taxpayers will save between $20 million and $60 million for the clean-up costs because Fox studios will pay to upgrade the dilapidated heritage buildings and other public assets. This is a good deal for the taxpayer which is made better by the 1,600 jobs created in the development proposal and the $200 million addition to Sydney's economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed some of the protests of the inner city indulgents which say that the showground should be converted to parkland. What sort of argument is this from inner city residents sitting up there in their manors overlooking Centennial Park when the inner city and the eastern suburbs of Sydney already have a huge share of the health resources, well out of proportion with their population, and a huge share of the jobs available in the Sydney metropolitan area, well out of proportion with their population? Not only do they want the oversupply of health services in the inner city and the oversupply of employment in the inner city, but they also want the oversupply of parkland. </PARA>

In fact, the showground has had no constructive and sustained public use for many years. The benefits flowing from the Fox studios will be immense. </PARA>

<PARA>The people supporting the use of the showground as parkland want the whole Sydney common&mdash;the whole 405 hectares&mdash;to be restored. That includes their own homes. The land covering the original Sydney common includes the homes of all the people surrounding Centennial Park and all the residents surrounding the Sydney showground. If they really want the government to turn over the use of the showground for parkland, they should also donate their own homes and property to the public sector for an equivalent purpose.

It was Reverend Keith Wilson, then a Labor Party member, who first raised the matter that Dr Lawrence knew of the petition before it was tabled, some say at the urging of the office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley).

In Western Australia lying to a court carries a 14-year gaol term. The third furphy relates to the question of different memories. The minister when premier was asked in state parliament about the petition for the first time only a couple of weeks after it was tabled.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business news sections of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on Monday, 20 November carried an article headlined, `London listing for $17m Cash Converters float'. In recent weeks, the national press has carried stories indicating plans on behalf of the organisation to float on the stock exchanges in both Australia and the United Kingdom. I also understand that the organisation is negotiating to commence large-scale operations in the United States. A recent issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Directions</EMPHASIS> quoted a Cash Converters director as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now have 117 stores in Australia, and are aiming at 250 around the country within the next three to four years.

Canada, Scotland, Ireland and the US are about to open, and we're talking with people who want to open in Japan, Spain, Holland and Germany.</PARA>
<PARA>The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 20 November refers to 124 franchised stores in Australia and 68 overseas stores. That would indicate a growth of more than 50 stores within just a few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of concern is that this entire industry exists as a seemingly legitimate front for the huge and growing market in stolen goods. The traditional pawnbroking industry always suffered a rather unsavoury reputation, derived not so much from allegations of usury as from the public perception that stolen goods found their way into the pawnbroking system. The arrival of Cash Converters has not seen any shrinking of the traditional pawnbroker's industry. On the contrary, this massive organisation appears to have created an entire new opportunity for an up-scaling of the market for stolen goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of even greater concern is the role that these stores have in the cycle of crime in our society. The typical example&mdash;and I am told this is an everyday event at virtually every Cash Converters store&mdash;involves a drug user stealing goods, often from families and otherwise by unlawful break-ins. The goods are sold at ridiculously low prices to Cash Converters to obtain money for the next drug fix. The money thus finds its way into the hands of the drug dealers and is then laundered in any of the myriad ways which seem to elude our law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of my constituents have undertaken extensive investigations of this organisation at their private expense.

My constituents have also unearthed a number of transactions which are so patently at odds with commercial reality that the company must know or be deemed to know that it is dealing in stolen goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one transaction involved goods to the value of $6,000 being purchased by Cash Converters for a mere $100. My constituents believe, but cannot prove, that these goods were subsequently on-sold for an unknown sum not to a member of the general public but to a then senior executive of Cash Converters, whom I am reluctant to name under parliamentary privilege until I have further proof. The goods are now believed to be fitted to that person's pleasure boat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another instance involving another pawnbroker&mdash;not Cash Converters in this instance&mdash;televideo equipment clearly marked as belonging to Channel Ten and having an estimated value of $10,000 was also purchased for the sum of $100. No effort was made to record the identity of the vendor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents pose a number of very interesting questions. For example, why is it that an organisation of the size of Cash Converters and with a self-admitted turnover in excess of $170 million per annum in Australia alone has never been able to lodge with the ASC or its predecessors a set of accounts indicating a profit or indeed indicating that they have ever paid taxes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pose that question, I also note that the $170 million referred to in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> refers to estimated sales of second-hand goods stated by the group in its prospectus. As a franchisor, the parent does not have any sales of goods; rather, it has income from franchise fees. I ask whether or not that very statement in relation to turnover is itself misleading in a manner that would never be tolerated by the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the organisation consistently fail to enforce proper use and verification of official identity materials? Despite the company's crowing to the contrary, their internal rules regarding client identity are rarely enforced. My constituents have obtained numerous examples that show that the so-called company policy is observed most commonly in the breach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have the law enforcement agencies failed to recognise the extent of this cancer and sought to eradicate it? State police in Western Australia have a small dealers squad which simply does not have the resources to properly check the transactions of second-hand dealers generally, and it has certainly not sought to single out Cash Converters in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, my constituents have obtained evidence of an extraordinary degree of cooperation between the Cash Converters organisation and the Western Australian police, even to the extent that representatives of Cash Converters were at one stage directed by a senior officer to attend regional police meetings. Whilst there is no clear evidence of corrupt behaviour in the relationship between Cash Converters and the Western Australian police, the inability of the police to conclude basic investigations and pursue simple prosecutions is a cause for great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have national law enforcement agencies failed to recognise the role of this organisation in the cycle of crime in Australia? Why have they not used their powers to seek to arrest the damage? The National Crime Authority already enjoys a reference in relation to money laundering and a general reference in relation to organised crime. On either basis, the authority should consider itself obliged at the very least to fully investigate the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not seek to initiate a witch-hunt in relation to that proposition. I merely say that the self-evident degree of association with the stolen goods market and the massive national bill associated with theft of property demand that the possible links be fully investigated. If the organisation is cleared in such an investigation, then so be it, but that there should be no investigation at all is intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On both sides of the House we speak long and hard about law and order and about organised crime. Here, when we find such a massive organisation right under our nose, we say that the problem is too hard and we therefore decline to act. This problem is not going to go away, and this parliament should have the courage to redress the situation in the interests of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also make specific inquiry and make public our concerns in order that this cancer should not spread abroad. The present proposal for the company to float on the stock exchange in the United Kingdom could seriously tarnish our reputation abroad and label Australia as the country which legitimised organised crime. When we are talking about appropriations, perhaps more of the funds could be better spent in an area of sorting out this organised crime. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Cameron</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Channel Seven news on Friday 20th October 1995 the Prime Minister, Mr Keating made a . . . remark about Mr John Howard on a talk back radio program fumbling with his headset and suggested he had St Vitas Dance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was appalled by that insensitive remark.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">St Vitas Dance in the last century was likened to several neurological illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Huntington's Disease has been identified as one of those illnesses. A "Genetic time bomb", a victim perhaps can spend 15 to 30 years of what should be their best productive years waiting for their ultimate death, as their mental and physical capacities slowly decline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Mr Keating to stand before an audience and publicly make fun of these people and their carers is irresponsible and insulting; unbecoming of any adult particularly one in public office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These people need to make it a priority to see for themselves the daily nightmare Huntington's patients and their carers endure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Western Australia, there is a marvellous association of committed and dedicated people who devote their lives ensuring their members have dignity and their carers support as this illness ravages their systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no cure but, prayerfully, research is making progress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As my Parliamentarian, I felt the need to convey my distress to you as Mr Keating, our Prime Minister, hurt so many people with this thoughtless remark.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This incident is more disturbing as it was made to score political points off Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not expect that we will have an apology from the Prime Minister, but perhaps the $800,000 misdirected towards propping up a discredited minister might be better off spent on research into diseases like Huntington's disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, all members would have received the annual report of the Department of Administrative Services. I would particularly like to speak on Australian Construction Services. The annual report showed that in 1994-95 Australian Construction Services made an operating loss of $8,343,000. The previous year, it made an operating loss of $4,069,000. The annual report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACS's trading performance over the past four years has been poor. The major causes of these results are the introduction of competition in a shrinking or static market.</PARA>
<PARA>I was glad to read further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A wide ranging review of management and administrative efficiency was undertaken during the year and decisions implemented to address the problems identified. The most significant of these was the decision to close down ACS and create a new and more tightly focused business unit.</PARA>
<PARA>While I realise there are some important aspects of ACS which need to be maintained, the work required of it is minimal, so I am glad that it is closing down. The new business unit should be given guidelines under which it will operate, and such guidelines should only be for confidential government work full stop. It should not compete with private enterprise, and private enterprise should be employed to do the non-confidential work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been contacted by a consulting engineer who has been forced to compete with ACS. He asked, `Why do I as a taxpayer have to pay a government authority to be in competition with me?' I agree. Why should taxpayers subsidise the ACS to compete with private enterprise when it comes in cheap, beats private enterprise for contracts and, at the end of the day, as proved in the annual report, makes a loss which is simply paid for by the taxpayers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the business, the home and the life of the ACS employees on the line if it makes a loss. Taxpayers will make up the difference. But if private enterprise make a loss, they are down the gurgler, as we all know. My constituent further writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, there are many examples where we&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, his engineering company&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have lost work to ACS because of their `cheap fees'. It is easy to see how they do it.</PARA>
<PARA>The 6 November issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> shows that despite cutting the work force from 2,000 to 550 it has still in the last four years required a cash injection of $40 million. The article shows that the corporatisation of the ACS is not working. There is no need for a government agency which is subsidised by the taxpayer and its infrastructure funded by the taxpayer to compete with private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should seriously consider closing down ACS or its new business unit. Why should we have taxpayer funded agencies competing with private enterprise? There is no need for the government to compete in the marketplace when there is a suitable private alternative. What is to stop the government setting up a new separate government agency which competes with the corner deli, for instance? The argument is the same: if they cannot compete with corner delis, why allow them to compete with engineers and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is simply no room for ACS or a new business unit like it to compete against private enterprise. The minister ought to put an immediate stop to it. We do not need government having separate business arms when there are numerous very successful businesses doing the job the government is seeking to do. There is no room for ACS in the marketplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the grievance debate on Monday I raised my concerns about the Victorian Minister for Sport, Recreation and Racing, the Hon. Tom Reynolds, and his relationship with the Victorian Greyhound Racing Control Board. I referred to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 17 November 1995, which detailed how the honourable gentleman received a lucrative lease of a greyhound which won $15,715 from the Victorian Greyhound Racing Control Board. Apparently, the arrangement was that Reynolds, when he was shadow minister, and the then state Liberal Party president, Mr Kroger, got a dog known as Liberal Victory under lease from the Greyhound Racing Control Board in return for paying to the board one per cent of their winnings. That dog, according to this newspaper report, won $15,715.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then shadow minister is now, of course, the minister for sport and is the minister responsible for organising and controlling the Greyhound Racing Control Board. It raises a number of questions. Firstly, it raises the probity of any member of parliament receiving a gift of $15,000-odd from a government body which has control over a racing industry. It raises the question of why the Hon. Tom Reynolds, when he became minister and in charge of the Greyhound Racing Control Board, did not immediately reveal the relationship he had with that board. In fact, it is known that some three weeks after his appointment as a minister that dog raced and winnings were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises further questions as to the probity of the board itself&mdash;very serious questions of probity. The Greyhound Racing Control Board is the body that regulates and controls greyhound racing in Victoria but, apparently, it owns racing dogs. How many racing dogs does the greyhound board in Victoria own? It certainly has one&mdash;Liberal Victory&mdash;which was lease gifted to a Victorian member of parliament, now the minister, but how many more dogs does it own? What other favourable leases has it entered into? How many other Victorians have received from the Victorian Greyhound Racing Control Board similar benefits? And why does the regulatory body of greyhound racing in Victoria own dogs? Under what possible circumstances is it appropriate for the regulatory body of dog racing in Victoria to own dogs and be involved as a participant in the industry? They are proper questions to which you cannot get answers in Victoria. They are questions that go to both probity of the regulatory body and probity of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yesterday, the shadow minister in Victoria, Jan Wilson, asked the Premier of Victoria a question on the ethics of his minister being in a position of receiving such a gift. Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett had a very quick response. `It is very simple,' he said, `you're jealous.' In other words, `What is wrong with one of my ministers being in a position of receiving gifts from a body which that minister now has the statutory responsibility of supervising?' It is pretty frightening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I know many members on both sides of this House would be very concerned about that, so I will not say that is general Liberal Party attitude. I will say that, in Victoria, it is Liberal government attitude. That is the way the Premier does things in Victoria. I really think it is time&mdash;if there is any decency, honesty and probity in government at all&mdash;that a major inquiry be instituted into the operation of the Greyhound Racing Control Board in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know and I can tell you, from the phone calls I received after I raised the issue, that people in the industry want to know how many dogs the board has got and how many other little leases like this one it has entered into. Mr Carr, the general manager of the control board, yesterday said publicly that it is all above board and that it is okay. So obviously Mr Carr is not going to tell us exactly what is going on down there in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also raises other concerns. As I said on Monday, it is known that in at least 30 races in Victoria involving dogs drugs have been used. How are the drugs administered? What sort of supervision is being undertaken by stewards and the Greyhound Racing Control Board in Victoria that does not prevent in at least 30 races dogs being doped before the race? It is pretty lax and it is pretty frightening. I see no evidence of any attitude by the government in Victoria to do anything about it. It is swept under the carpet in typical Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Victoria it has taken over two years to get the Victoria Police to investigate a major dog breeding scam involving the dog Malawi Prince, yet yesterday I was informed on the telephone by other dog racing people in Victoria that that is not the only scam. There are other instances where high fees have been paid for a major sire, yet the bitch has been mated with an inferior dog despite the high fee being paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not just one dog involved in this scam; there are other dogs. There has been no response from the Victorian government to undertake any decent inquiry into the quite serious allegations involving dog racing. Other allegations put to me yesterday involved the fact that bookmakers in Victoria can own and race a dog. Stop and think about that. How is it proper in the racing industry for a bookmaker to own a racing dog and be able to race it? Apparently probity does not exist in the dog racing industry in Victoria.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was given the name of a bookmaker who owns a dog and races it in Victoria and still attends the track as a bookmaker. That leads to the risk of absolute corruption. It is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises issues, also, of the way the police now operate in Victoria. Let me say at the outset, as a member of the Victorian Retired Police Association, that I have nothing but absolute praise for all police forces and all police officers in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite a very difficult lifestyle and a very difficult job, Australia is generally very well served by its police officers. I have been proud to be a member of the Victorian police force. Nevertheless, events have occurred in Victoria which raise critical issues involving the Victorian police force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the former chief commissioner of police in Victoria retired his position was advertised. A number of senior police in Australia applied for that position. None of those applicants was accepted and the position was re-advertised. Unbeknown to people at the time, Superintendent Kevin Holliday&mdash;a card carrying member of the Liberal party&mdash;together with a state Liberal member of parliament went to Queensland and saw then Assistant Commissioner Comrie, a relatively junior policeman in terms of experience but a former serving Victorian police officer. I have no doubt that Mr Comrie is a person of integrity. This is not an attack on Mr Comrie but, rather, on the political system which is now working in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the position was advertised Mr Comrie had not applied. When it was re-advertised, and after the visit by Superintendent Kevin Holliday and the Liberal Party member of parliament, Mr Comrie applied. Guess who got the job? Mr Comrie! As I said, he was a relatively junior police officer. His appointment cost the loss to the Victorian police force of Assistant Commissioner John Frame&mdash;a very highly respected police officer&mdash;and Bernie Masterton, the most senior woman</PARA>
<PARA>police officer ever to have been appointed in Victoria. Those people left the police force, leaving no doubt in anyone's mind that they were disgusted with the way the appointment was made. Again there is no suggestion that Mr Comrie is anything other than a fine, moral, and upright serving police officer. But he did not apply for the job in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superintendent Kevin Holliday went on to become the chief of staff of the new chief commissioner. Chief Commissioner Comrie signed one of the new Kennett government contracts. In the past the chief commissioner of police was totally independent of government and had a permanent position. He was totally separated from government under the separation of powers doctrine. The new chief superintendent of police in Victoria is under contract. He has no permanency of position and is subject to the terms of the contract. The contract contains performance conditions on industrial relations and reducing crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the minister for police can impose requirements upon the chief commissioner of police; hence that independence or that separation has gone in Victoria. That is a worry. Of course, Superintendent Kevin Holliday became chief of staff and controlled the media in the Kennett Victorian police force. Now there are attempts in Victoria to place assistant commissioners on contract with the chief commissioner having the right to hire and fire, with no right of appeal whatsoever. So if Mr Comrie doesn't like you, you go, and no appeal is possible. That is totally new in terms of police service where there has always been an appeals board where police have had the right to appeal against either non-appointment to senior positions or unnecessary or perceived to be wrongful dismissal. It is changing in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that sometimes we forget the events that occurred in Queensland where Russell Hinze controlled the racing industry. We found out through the Fitzgerald inquiry how corrupt that was. We forget that Terry Lewis, the disgraced former chief commissioner in Queensland, was in a position where he controlled totally the appointments and the promotions within the Queensland police force. Through the Fitzgerald inquiry, we now know just how corrupt that was. Yet in Victoria, the Kennett government is establishing a police system where the right to hire and fire is being put into the hands of a single person and that person is subject to a contract&mdash;is not permanent&mdash;with the state government. If that does not cause concern in Australia, nothing ever will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fitzgerald in his report pointed out that one of the major problems in the Queensland police force was the absolute power that Terry Lewis had and was given by that corrupt government. Those lessons of history, those lessons on the causes and reasons for corruption, are being lost in Victoria. The potential&mdash;and I say no more than that&mdash;for that form of corruption and absolute control is starting to emerge, despite the fact that I accept the integrity of the people involved. It is not their integrity that worries me; it is the political system. Once you put it in place, it is possible to have that corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the scams on dogs and the absolute rottenness of the dog racing industry in Victoria, other matters have arisen since I did an interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today </EMPHASIS>show this morning and was asked about New South Wales and corruption in harness racing. I pointed out that over a number of years as a member of parliament I have received a lot of anecdotal evidence about corruption in harness racing. I have never doubted for a moment that there is corruption in harness racing because owners of horses and trainers of horses have told me that horses and races are fixed. I have accepted that. The recent report on jockeys in Australia found they were being paid off and that horseracing was subject to corruption by jockeys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that in New South Wales there is an inquiry called the Roderick inquiry and a report called the Roderick report. This morning I have received a number of phone calls from people in the harness industry who tell me that in New South Wales it is pretty crook and has been for a number of years. I hope that that Roderick report will be acted upon. I am told there have been a number of reports over different governments in New South Wales drawing attention to institutionalised corruption in the harness industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, when you look at the allegations of corruption, many of them now verified, in dog racing in Victoria and allegations of institutionalised corruption in harness racing in New South Wales, you have to accept that this flows on to other states because Victorian horses race in New South Wales and New South Wales bred and trained horses race in Victoria. You have to accept that if there is corruption in New South Wales, as alleged, that corruption is not just limited to New South Wales. Indeed, my anecdotal evidence in Victoria from people I have known in the industry for a number of years is that it is corrupt in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that with all these allegations it is time there was a major inquiry into the entire racing industry in Australia&mdash;dog and horse, including harness. There has been enough evidence exposed in Australia recently to show that unarguably there is corruption. We have ministers who are compromised, as is the case with the Hon. Tom Reynolds, who is compromised in his position as minister. I do not expect a fair and open inquiry into the allegations about dogs in Victoria when the Premier says: `You are only jealous', and the minister is compromised. It is time an independent body was given sufficient power to make a proper inquiry into the whole industry. In my view, that has to be the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A special reference should be given to the National Crime Authority by the states, if they have any concern at all, so it can use its special powers, its royal commission powers, to have a thorough inquiry into the whole rotten mess that involves racing in Australia today. If that is not done, then the allegations being put to me will never be properly tested. The states do not seem to want to do anything about it; they would rather sweep it under the carpet because it is all too difficult. If it is not done, then decent, ordinary people will suffer. Greyhound owners are generally wage earners; it is a sport they can afford. They put a lot of money into their dogs. They tell me they are concerned. They are not going to get justice. They are going to be part of an industry the allegations about which have merit and they are not going to get satisfaction. We are going to have a harness industry in which for years I have been told you can fix races. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now in New South Wales there is evidence of institutionalised corruption. Minister Wheeler indicated in the New South Wales Parliament, I understand this week, that he was not prepared to release the Roderick report because it would cause the death of people&mdash;a pretty big statement to make. If that is correct&mdash;if the material contained in the Roderick report is such that people's lives are at risk on releasing it&mdash;then it has to go a bit beyond a state police institution; it has to go national. It has to go to a body with very powerful investigative capacity, such as the National Crime Authority. I firmly believe that it is now time for the states to give that special reference to the National Crime Authority. I would urge strongly that that be done. </PARA>

While I have had some success with the government, it seems that the worst areas are still receiving no assistance. To, hopefully, bring home to the government the great need that is out there I would like to read a letter that I have received from one of my constituents. I have the writer's permission to use the letter and the name. It is from a Mr Keith Morgan, of Bundella, Cobar. He writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write in reference to the drought exceptional circumstances provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We run a 60,000 acre property 40 kilometres north-west of Cobar called Bundella. We have been in drought conditions here for the past five years except for a brief break in 1993. In the last few years I have had to shoot over 4,000 sheep to save them from starvation with no assistance, monetary or otherwise, from the government. In January of this year we had 14 inches of rain, which effectively wiped out in excess of 100 head of cattle. They were bogged to their stomachs and once again I had to take the gun out and shoot these cattle. I might add I came away close to shooting myself on that occasion. We were not entitled to any assistance for the loss of these cattle. No feed grew after that rain, as the temperature was in the 40s and of course no feed will grow when it is that hot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now 10 months down the track and we still have 60,000 acres of bare ground with no feed on it and we still are not entitled to Exceptional Circumstances assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August we had to auction the majority of our farm machinery to pay interest at the bank&mdash;still no Exceptional Circumstances.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our health is suffering from the constant stress, our finances were depleted long ago and our will to keep going has just about gone. The Baptist Church recently helped us by paying our phone and power bill which we are very grateful for. We have many more unpaid bills again and we are at the bank's mercy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir I invite you and your colleagues to come out and have a look for yourself at the desperate situation we and many others in this area are in. If you did you could see for yourself that these are not just idle words. It is fact and reality and all efforts by the Cobar RLPB and others in the last 12 months seem to have fallen on deaf ears. It is an injustice of the highest order and only serves to burden us with a lot of unnecessary stress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had about as much as we can take and we ask you please to look in to this matter as soon as possible before we are all down the drain.</PARA>
<PARA>I rang the Morgans to have a chat to them after that letter and got on to Keith's wife, Pam, who confirmed much of what was in that letter. For example, when the rain fell in January, the cattle were in a weakened state. They went chasing the green pick down on the flats. They got bogged up to their bellies. The Morgans still had their tractors then&mdash;they had not yet sold them&mdash;and they managed to pull a number of the cattle out. They gave them the usual tender loving care of water and hay, et cetera, but none of the cattle ever stood up again. All that work was for nothing and they had to shoot the lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in Cobar last Saturday at an event and the Morgans were coming into town that day, so I met them both&mdash;and I have to say that I was very impressed with this couple. He has been away driving a truck for the council to earn some off-farm income&mdash;which, ironically, excludes him from the hardship assistance provisions. He is driving this truck about 150 kilometres south of where they live, so she is on the property on her own at night, which many wives are in these circumstances. It is not something that she relishes but it is something you have to put up with in the bush. She has to cut scrub for the cattle, mainly with a chainsaw. She had bruises from where one of the mulga trees that she was cutting had fallen over her. That is one of the things you have to put up with, I suppose. It reminded me of the line in John Williamson's song&mdash;just another day on our selection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this case to show there are very genuine people in need of assistance. While we are all very careful, hopefully, not to waste taxpayers' money I believe there are hundreds of cases like this in my electorate where people deserve assistance because they are pulling their weight: earning export income for Australia, trying to keep bread on the table and trying to keep off the dole. Yet nothing is forthcoming for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks previous to that I had visited properties north of Wilcannia, up towards Tilpa. People there had contacted me on a number of occasions. I was grateful to Murray McClure of Trevallyn at Wilcannia and Stephen Cresswell of Annalara Station at Wilcannia for taking me around. We drove for several kilometres over totally bare ground in black country and in red country. To drive for tens of kilometres and not see one blade of grass is a depressing experience indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tens of square kilometres out there have been totally de-stocked, yet this area also does not receive any exceptionable circumstance assistance. These people are at their wits end as to what to do. In the last two years, they have received five inches of rain and 5 1/2 inches of rain. Of the 5 1/2 inches, 350 points of that fell in one day and basically ran off. The RASAC report&mdash;RASAC went there and did an inspection&mdash;says that this area had received too much rain. I am honestly at a loss to understand the criteria that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) has laid down for RASAC to go by in determining who should be recommended for exceptionable circumstance assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the summers of 1993-94 and 1994-95, it says that the Wilcannia area got 93 per cent too much rain and 84 per cent too much rain respectively. Possibly there was some area in the board that did get too much rain, but I have yet to see it. There are only a handful of properties there, but they are probably as big as the whole Rural Lands Protection Board area towards the east of my electorate. These people have no feed. They cannot get agistment for their stock. In many cases, they cannot get further loans from the bank. These families are desperate. The criteria are patently ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this place before, the minister has to come to a decision. Either he wants to help people who are genuinely in need or he does not. If he does not want to help them, that is fair enough&mdash;that is the government's prerogative&mdash;but he should not pretend that he is helping them when he is patently not. I appeal again to the minister to look at these cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention division A of the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board, which I have raised in this place before. The RASAC report says that they received 27 per cent too much rain in the autumn of 1995. It says in the report that the rainfall was effective. The rain virtually fell in a day. The New South Wales Department of Agriculture, the council, the Rural Lands Protection Board and the Department of Agriculture district agronomists whom I have spoken to said that the rain was ineffective because the soils are hard-setting and the water ran off. You can see for yourself how the water ran. You can see the stones that have been turned over in the fast flowing water and the erosion that was caused.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RASAC report says that there will be another review of these areas at the end of spring. Apart from the fact that these people have not had a spring, I presume that that means now, because, if you go by the calendar, the end of this month will be the end of spring. I have heard that RASAC is visiting the areas that already have exceptional circumstance assistance to see whether that assistance should be removed or not. I appeal to the minister to direct RASAC to go back to these areas and listen again to the people on the ground in Condobolin, Nyngan, Wilcannia and Cobar in the rural lands protection boards. They should reassess them and see that they are included for assistance, which is only their basic right if we are setting out to help these people. </PARA>

We looked at how the surplus was composed&mdash;the spending, revenue and asset sales components&mdash;and we said that it was highly unlikely to take place, that far from there being a surplus there would be a deficit. The government mocked us at some length and said that there would definitely be a surplus, and here we are a few months down the track and the government is admitting there can be no surplus this year.

The obvious reason is that it will have to raise taxes to try to balance its budget in the future. </PARA>

It was decided in a different manner. It was a cabinet decision to pay that amount. We on this side of the House have decided to oppose the payment of $244,000 of that component because it did not relate directly to the Marks royal commission.

Certainly there was advice coming from those in her party, including the national president, as I understand it, that she should step aside. But the Prime Minister forced her to say there. I do not know why he did that. He probably saw that there was no suitable female replacement for her on the frontbench. Also, he gets a pig-headed, arrogant, belligerent attitude to certain things and he cannot be told what to do by others. So he made her stay.

I thought that was totally uncalled for. I do not know Mr Wilson; I have never met the man. But he was a former minister of the cloth, as I understand it. From all reports that I have heard from both sides of parliament, although he may have been naive in some aspects of politics, he was basically a decent person. The only sin I see that he committed was telling the truth. When he did that and had his name smeared by the present minister for health, it was another Labor member of the state government&mdash;Pam Beggs&mdash;who came out to defend him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of nonsense spoken about ANL. We are told that it is losing $22 million a year and $2 million a month. My argument about ANL has always rested on a very simple proposition. Australia is an island continent.

They have magnificent roads in many parts of South Africa. In the townships, of course, the roads are appalling, but the highways linking the cities of South Africa are magnificent. The money for that was taken from the defence budget. I really do not think this is such a big issue in the overall scheme of government expenditure. Really, what is $22 million?

It is a defence measure: it is very important that this island continent, which is so dependent on shipping for its exports and imports, have its own national line.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the commitment of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) to the saga of ANL. No member of this parliament knows more about that shipping line than he, and I concur with him on some aspects of the valuation of that shipping line. I wish to address the appropriation bills and draw some international comparisons between Australia's position and the current budget proposals that are before the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) brought down the 1995-96 budget documents, he foreshadowed a $718 million surplus. Of course, the surplus was based on there being $5.4 billion worth of asset sales. Added into these figures were the important one-off dividends from government enterprises like Telstra, whose report was just circulated in the last three or four days. The government received $950 million from that instrumentality&mdash;very little political cost, yet almost $1 billion was contributed to the government coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, Australia Post contributed $254 million by way of government charges and $120 million by way of dividends, a total of $374 million. In recent times, I have had something to do with Australia Post. In my view, it is doing a very good job&mdash;as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and it is making a major contribution to the government's budgetary arrangements. This budget had the second highest revenue increase since the Whitlam government. Looking at the budget papers, members can identify that quite clearly, and that factor has not been given wide enough attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these particular bills before the House, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks an additional $836 million. Now, the figures in themselves are not all that important, but it just indicates the trend. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) seeks another $577 million. So the government in these particular budget measures is seeking more money to run the country at a time when things are pretty tough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failed sale of AIDC and the ongoing ANL debacle&mdash;which you, Deputy Speaker Hollis, know a fair bit about&mdash;leave the Commonwealth with a substantial deficit for 1995-96, not the very much touted surplus that they originally suggested would take place. Of course, this is before the government go out in the election campaign, offering all kinds of unfunded promises as they usually do. So we do not know what the final figure will be by the end of the budget program. If you look at the fine print, most of the money that the government are seeking is for increases in the running of various departments; that is, more administration. The money is not being devoted to the people of Australia; it is being devoted to administrative areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the Department of Social Security is spending an extra $72 million on running costs. But in my electorate the department wants to close the departmental office in Belmont, without notice and without giving advice to the local member, in an effort to cut administrative costs. Meanwhile, the Department of Defence is spending another $103 million and DEET is spending another $55 million on running costs. The taxpayers would wonder what value they are getting for their taxes when the government spends these additional sums on purely administrative running costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Also included in this bill is the amount of $800,000 or thereabouts to pay the costs of Carmen Lawrence's High Court challenges to the Easton royal commission, and other legal charges. The appropriation bill will also help to pay the legal expenses of former minister Alan Griffiths during the sandwich shop affair. So members have every reason to wonder what the government are doing in this area. Another $7 million is handed out to Premier Bob Carr's New South Wales Labor government for the Sydney Showground to make way for the new Fox studios, and a further $25 million to develop a new home for the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales in Homebush Bay. So, apart from the increased administrative costs of these few departments, the government have found extra money all of a sudden to look after a few of their Labor mates: Minister Lawrence, former Minister Griffiths and, of course, Labor Premier Bob Carr from New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the taxpayer does not see much benefit from those sorts of expenditures. The members of the government are always saying in the rhetoric in this parliament that they are a low tax, low spending government, but the facts do not support that. Despite these claims of fiscal responsibility, the government's debt has risen by 130 per cent during the period that Prime Minister Keating has been in office. The really staggering figure is that the Australian Bureau of Statistics recently reported that the six state governments&mdash;that is, the governments to which the Prime Minister as Treasurer and as Prime Minister continually reduces their flow of income&mdash;have reduced their combined debts by $2.5 billion. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth in the same year has increased its debt by $12 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us draw that comparison between the states and the federal government. For the first time in several years, Victoria under Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett has reduced its public debt with a strong budget surplus. State governments have faced the difficult task of repairing their budget bottom lines, while the Commonwealth continues to spend up big. The Commonwealth government debt now stands at $93 billion or 20.5 per cent of GDP. Now let us look at what it was five years ago. The Commonwealth's net debt was only $26.5 billion or 8.75 per cent of GDP. It was during this time that Prime Minister Keating took office, and before that he was Treasurer. We have seen this staggering change in the debt that the Commonwealth now owes&mdash;from $26 billion to $93 billion. By the middle of 1996, the Commonwealth debt will be over $100 billion. That is, this government, with the responsibility for this parliament, will be owing $100 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put this in perspective, the debts incurred by the Cain and Kirner Labor governments in Victoria totalled $30 billion when the Kennett government was swept to power in 1992. Victoria's debt remains at about one-third of the Commonwealth's debt. What we can deduce from this is that Labor governments equal big debts. The figures are here on the public record to support this proposition very strongly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. As the honourable member for Parkes suggests, they cannot handle money. Prime Minister Whitlam was unable to do that. When you look at the figures and go past the rhetoric, the present government has the same problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt arose from a steady stream of excessive spending by the government, especially in the period leading up to the 1993 election. The government's problems would have been a lot worse if it had actually paid the promised l-a-w&mdash;in the statutes&mdash;tax cuts. Of course, those tax cuts were removed, even though the Prime Minister promised that they would be implemented without fear or favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the $4 billion to $6 billion which is to be spent on the 1994 Working Nation white paper initiatives. It has been difficult to get the figures, but the government has said that between $4 billion and $6 billion will be spent on these make-work employment and training programs. That is something that most people do not fully understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the unfunded liabilities of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme are growing all the time. At the end of 1993 the unfunded liabilities of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme amounted to $38 billion. It is always pretty difficult to get this figure, but there it is&mdash;unfunded and moving out into the future. Future taxpayers and future budgets will have to sustain that figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that estimates of the unfunded liabilities of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and the public sector superannuation scheme could be as high as $64 billion at this very moment. Superannuation schemes are funded by individuals and by the companies concerned. However, the government has an unfunded scheme with future liabilities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, the Kennett government bit the bullet and moved its unfunded liabilities down from approximately $19 billion to $14 billion. That government is moving in the right direction while the Commonwealth government is moving in the completely opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw a comparison between the Australian position and the New Zealand budget which was brought down on 1 June 1995. The New Zealand government confirmed a budget surplus of 3.6 per cent of GDP, without any asset sales. The New Zealand government's position is diametrically the opposite of that of the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this financial year the New Zealand government will pay off $2.3 billion worth of public debt. New Zealand is moving in the right direction. New Zealand's net debt will then be 33.6 per cent of GDP and will fall to 18.7 per cent of GDP by 1997-98 before the introduction of further tax cuts. In 1991-92 New Zealand's public debt was 51 per cent of GDP. In a short time, by changing its policies, the New Zealand government has been able to bring about a dramatic change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the New Zealand dollar has appreciated 40 per cent against the Australian currency since mid-1983? That has been achieved by fiscal responsibility and a change in government policy. The whole budgetary process in New Zealand is streets ahead of Australia's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 New Zealand's Fiscal Responsibility Act was passed. This act brought about the adherence to five central principles: debt reduction; keeping the budget in balance; maintaining a government balance sheet and increasing the net worth according to that balance sheet; prudent financial management of risks; and predictability about the level and stability of taxes. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act the government produces a range of regular and comprehensive fiscal and economic data. The quality and range of information provided exceeds that expected of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a dramatic change in the way in which the New Zealand government presents its data to the people. There is far greater pre-budget and pre-election scrutiny of the government's fiscal activities. Compare this with Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker, where two days ago the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) told the Senate that nobody really knew whether there would be a surplus this year or not. That is the state of play in Australia compared with the clear position in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New Zealand the people know that they will have a surplus of 3.6 per cent of GDP. New Zealand's current account is two per cent of GDP compared with six per cent in Australia. That is a genuine comparison between the two countries. We have one country moving in the right direction and the other country moving down a slippery slope, as I will demonstrate in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's current account percentage of GDP is the worst in the OECD&mdash;even worse than Mexico's. The comparison between Australia and Mexico is not lost on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>&mdash;one of the Prime Minister's favourite magazines. When he was the world's best Treasurer he was often inclined to quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> as a source of information and to support the view that he was the world's best Treasurer at the time. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> dated 4 November 1995 published an article under the heading `How lucky can you get? Guess who's looking rather like Mexico?'. I will quote the first paragraph because it encapsulates the argument:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ever since Mexico's peso hit a spot of bother at the end of last year, pundits and investors have been kicking themselves for having failed to spot the trouble in advance. There were, after all, clues to be had, notably the country's whopping current-account deficit. So which emerging economy is the next Mexico? Here's one candidate. Its inflation has risen fivefold over the past three years, its current-account deficit is six per cent of GDP, and&mdash;after external deficits in 28 of the past 30 years&mdash;its net foreign debt stands at a horrid 40 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funnily enough this is Australia, sometimes known as the `lucky country', whose present stroke of fortune is to combine a third-world economy with a first-world standard of living. But its luck may be running out. Its headline inflation rate rose to 5.1 per cent in September, the highest for five years.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to discuss the current account deficit and contrasts Australia with Asia. In Asia current account deficits help to finance investment in long-term capital projects. The article points out that in Australia the current account deficit is more likely to finance short-term investments in equities and bonds which can come and go according to confidence or sentiment. This can leave the country high and dry as the international financiers decide to move their funds out. The issue is as much about the cause of the current account deficit as about the actual size. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The trouble is that Australia is not as Asian as that. The causes of its current-account deficit are bad. In Australia's case the deficit, in combination with rising inflation, signals an overheating economy, and&mdash;on a deeper level&mdash;a persistent failure to save. Household savings have slumped from 10 per cent of disposal income in 1980 to 3 per cent this year&mdash;one of the lowest savings rates in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA>The fundamental problem facing Australia is that we are borrowing capital around the world just for our own consumption purposes. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far, the government has done too little. A budget last May planned a shift into surplus in the year to June 1996, but intends to achieve this largely through bigger asset sales and other contrivances . . . The government also plans to promote savings through compulsory employee contribution to pension funds, but much more is needed.</PARA>
<PARA>The article draws attention to the fact that the surplus is being achieved by asset sales. The last paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tie me economy down sport.</PARA>
<PARA>What a wonderful comment that is. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Raise interest rates and taxes? Paul Keating, now Prime Minister with an election due by May, can hardly welcome such advice. But May 1996 will also be the tenth anniversary of his famous speech as finance minister, when he warned his countrymen that without a proper economic policy Australia would end up as a banana republic. It still could.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quotation from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, volume 337 dated November 1995. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> is observing sensible economic practices and comparing Australia with Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at employment and draw the comparison between Australia and New Zealand. While the unemployment rate in Australia is 8.5 per cent and rising&mdash;it went from 8.3 to 8.5 and we do not know what the next set of figures will be, but there are indications that the rate may rise even further&mdash;yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reported that the situation is very different in New Zealand. In New Zealand the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.1 per cent, the lowest in seven years. So in New Zealand we have a downward trend because of sensible economic policies and a more flexible industrial relations situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, sensible economic policies are being adopted. The Kennett government inherited a state debt of $30 million as well as unfunded liabilities of $19 billion. They have set about reining in the budget deficit without increasing taxes on businesses and without massive cuts to capital expenditure. Compare this with the federal government and the increased taxes imposed by former Treasurer Dawkins&mdash;company tax, petrol excise, wholesale sales tax and fringe benefits tax, which all incrementally over time impact on Australian taxpayers and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time the Keating government has seen capital spending falling to a point where there is now a negative of $3.5 billion. Not only are we spending it on consumption; we are not spending it on our capital stock and we are building debts. The Prime Minister would have us believe that Australia is as good as it ever gets, to use that wonderful quote. So, whilst there was a fair amount of criticism of the privatisation of the Victorian power utilities, the approximately $9 billion that has been received from the sale of those power utilities will be directed towards reducing the debt of those power instrumentalities, which is extraordinarily high, and the debt of that state overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thrust of what I am saying on the public record is this: during the period of the Keating-Hawke government the national debt&mdash;that is, what Australia owes to foreigners&mdash;has moved from about $36 billion to $180 billion. That figure is irrefutable, and it is irrefutable who was responsible for the financial affairs of this nation during that period. The government debt will be $100 billion in 1996, again under Prime Minister Keating. The current account deficit continues to be in the vicinity of $25 billion or $27 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In simple terms, Labor governments manage, both at a state and federal level, to produce red figures, deficits and debts. Nothing on the public record can refute that evidence. They are unable to handle the economy, they are unable to handle the finances of this nation in a financially responsible manner and they impose on future generations horrendous debts of both a capital and ongoing nature. The people of Australia should clearly understand that if they vote for the Labor government they are voting for a continuation of more debts, more problems and a lucky country that is running out of time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this opportunity to speak about a financial matter principally relating to the territory government of the ACT. It therefore has national implications because it relates to the total level of resources available to that government. The issue I want to talk about is the report that was tabled yesterday into the administration of the ACT leasehold system. This is a very high quality report. It is the most definitive overview of the leasehold system that I can recall, certainly for the last 20 years. It is a thorough review of both the structure and the administration of the leasehold system. It is careful, well judged and well informed. I congratulate both the Carnell Liberal government for establishing the inquiry and the committee members for the quality of the report they have prepared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report discusses both the leasehold system and the planning system because they are both integrally interrelated. I want to begin my remarks by summarising what the report discusses because it is a very interesting and thorough review of the leasehold system in the ACT. It begins by drawing attention to the tensions in the administration of the leasehold system which led to the establishment of the inquiry. It points out that there have been many inquiries into the leasehold system during the last 25 years, one of which was done by the joint parliamentary committee on the ACT which I was chairing at the time and which is quoted at length in this report. So this is an issue in which this parliament has a particular interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board notes the diversity of views about the leasehold system of the ACT but draws attention to the fact that there are a number of common concerns by people on all sides of this discussion. Those common concerns relate to the failure to enforce the policies about lease purpose clauses that have been in operation and, therefore, the failure of compliance, the frequency of changes to betterment rules since 1990 and the tensions which have existed for decades&mdash;and I will come back to this&mdash;between leasehold administration and planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report discusses the reasons for the establishment of a leasehold system in the ACT. Those reasons included the value of a leasehold system as compared with a freehold system in providing a basis for specification of land use. The other characteristics of a leasehold system are that it is usually for a specified term, commonly 99 years; it includes covenants and conditions binding the lessee; and the lease is subject to the payment of a premium or rent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four reasons underlying the establishment of the system identified at the time were that it contributes to avoiding speculation in undeveloped land, it defrays the expenses of establishing the national capital&mdash;again something that this parliament is likely to be interested in&mdash;it allows unearned increments in land value to be retained by the Australian people and it ensures an orderly planning process via lease purpose clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the features of the administration of the leasehold system in the ACT, which has existed throughout the ACT's existence, has been the struggle between planning and land management. There has been evidence of that throughout the history of the ACT. This has led to the development of an unnecessarily complex land act. The inquiry notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administration of the land act continues to lack leadership, direction and clear objectives. The quality of administration and decision making has led to perceptions by the general public that the integrity of the leasehold system has been compromised.</PARA>
<PARA>The report discusses particular problems in the recent development of planning and lease administration. It then goes on to discuss a new framework. It says that most people making submissions to the inquiry wanted a more certain, secure, efficient, transparent and accountable system and one which was less complex and expensive. Everyone would join in seeking those objectives. Very encouragingly, the board concludes that, given political will, these objectives are all achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee was asked to inquire into whether the leasehold system should continue or a new land tenure system be introduced. It came down firmly and strongly on the side of continuing a leasehold system on the grounds that it still contributes to avoiding land speculation, it allows unearned increments to be retained by the government, it defrays the cost of the ACT and it ensures orderly planning by lease purpose clauses. They are very important goals. The fact that the system allows the possibility of achieving them all is a very strong basis for maintaining the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also concluded that it could find no evidence that the existence of the system was in any significant sense scaring off interstate or overseas investors. Certainly the business sector has on occasion claimed that to be so, but there was no clearly verifiable evidence of it occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report then goes on to talk about the administration of both land and planning. It says that, for a whole series of reasons, the present structure has been significantly inadequate. It proposes a new structure which would provide a better basis for professional and efficient planning and land management. It proposes the creation of a statutory planning authority with specified tasks to replace the existing departmental office. It suggests that that new statutory authority produce a series of development control plans for redevelopment with the full involvement of the community. It also proposes the establishment of a statutory land management authority headed by a statutory officer called a land manager who would again have specified responsibilities. Those two bodies should be coordinated through a part-time planning and land management corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the board recommend that these two statutory authorities be staffed after a nationwide recruitment campaign. One of the central points that the report makes is that, particularly in the land management area, there has been a lack of professionalism. The committee draw attention to the lack of post-secondary and tertiary qualifications in land management. There has been a tendency for land administration to be treated as a general administrative task by people who are not professionally qualified in the area, who do not understand fully the system that they are expected to administer and who have administered it not only inefficiently but also in ways that were less than fully accountable to the wider community. A nationwide recruitment campaign for professionally qualified people would be a very effective way of overcoming that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also discuss the issue of betterment, which they propose, quite appropriately, be entitled a development rights charge. They recommend that betterment be treated as openly as possible. They say that there is little empirical evidence to establish that betterment impedes development. In fact, they say that the charging of betterment discourages speculation and inflationary pressures in the housing sector and that it probably contributes to more stable land prices and, therefore, confers a benefit on investors. They go on to say that there is no reason why developers should be subsidised by the rest of the community, so they recommend a 100 per cent development rights charge after an interim period. Looking at their argument, I can see no basis for the interim period. I think full betterment should be introduced immediately. The logic of their own argument also suggests that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have proposed the establishment of comprehensive land management accounts as a way of clearly identifying the transactions that take place and, therefore, making them more accountable. That is a very important recommendation because those conditions are not being met at present. One of the real problems with the existing system has been that, because there has not been adequate financial accountability, it has been difficult to assess the consequences of various decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vital that those decisions be more transparent, that information about them be readily available to the public and that the consequences of them be clear. One of the recommendations is that those accounts should be audited by the Auditor-General, which is something that anyone concerned about proper fiscal management would totally support. The committee talk about the importance of transparency in all decision making, not only financial decision making. They make recommendations to improve accountability and lease compliance and enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee make some quite stunning descriptions of the failure to enforce lease purpose clauses quoting examples where the use of leases has been in breach of lease purpose clauses for 15 years. The land management people have been constantly reminded of that, yet the lease purpose clauses have not been enforced. It is vital to the integrity of the system that such lease purpose clauses be fully enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem with having untrained officers in the area of land management&mdash;people without adequate professional qualification who are therefore unable to administer the system as effectively as would be possible&mdash;has been the failure to develop a logical, consistent and professional system and in the absence of such a system to be able to do deals, to negotiate things which should not be negotiated, to discuss in ways that are neither transparent nor necessarily logical possible projects and to make decisions where the outcomes of which are not necessarily consistent with existing policy. The committee says in its report that it did not look for evidence of corruption but, without the kinds of structural reforms and professionalism that I have mentioned and that the committee has recommended, the community cannot have confidence that such deals were never corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my remarks by talking about one particular example which is cause for great concern because it affects proper government, proper fiscal responsibility and in fact part of my electorate. It relates to the location of the offices of the Department of the Environment, Land and Planning. The Territory Plan says that Canberra will be developed as a series of discrete towns separated by hills, ridges and buffer zones and that each town is intended to be relatively self-contained providing for most of its residents' needs, including a diversity of housing types and a range of employment opportunities. The town centres of Belconnen, Tuggeranong, Woden and, more recently, Gungahlin as well as Civic have been planned on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first opportunities for locating such an office in the Gungahlin area was with the ACT government's Department of the Environment, Land and Planning which, because of the disrepair of the offices it currently occupies, felt that it needed new office accommodation. The public servants concerned put up a proposal to the then Chief Minister, Rosemary Follett, in January saying that the new offices should be authorised but it would be best to have them fairly centrally located. The Chief Minister responded to that recommendation by saying, `I think Gungahlin is the best option for DELP.' In other words, the Chief Minister clearly and categorically said that the offices should be located in Gungahlin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that clear instruction on 19 January, at the end of January, after campaigning for the local election had begun, an advertisement appeared in the commercial property section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> calling for expressions of interest to build office accommodation noting that a central location was preferred. That central location is not Gungahlin. So the people who wrote that advertisement did so in a way that was completely contrary to the instructions of their minister, the Chief Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When discussing this afterwards, Rosemary Follett has said that she had no knowledge of that advertisement and that it was not cleared with her or with any other minister. The present Attorney-General and Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning, Gary Humphries, has said that he fully accepts Ms Follett's statement. Despite that, Jeff Townsend, the Secretary to the Department of Environment, Land and Planning, said in a letter to this inquiry that the advertisements for a new building for DELP were approved late last year by the then Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Urban Services and that the advertisements did not specify any particular location in either Dickson or otherwise. Quite clearly, that is not true. They did specify a central location quite contrary to what the Chief Minister had instructed. This means that Mr Townsend misled the inquiry. His letter, as the inquiry notes, is at odds with the statement of the former Chief Minister about the involvement of Mr Lamont. Further, the advertisements specify the central location as being preferred. So it was contrary to instructions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern that one would have about this relates to why this decision was made. Not only is it clearly improper for a public servant to act contrary to the instructions of his minister but also one wonders why he was so determined to do so. I do not know why he was so determined to do so. One is concerned to see that the new Land and Environment Bureau building, which is the new name for DELP, is to be located in Dickson on a site owned by G. S. Shaw and Associates. The same company was involved in the Torrens Street development in Braddon and is linked to the investment company, which I am told is owned by G. S. Shaw and P. Philips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this issue is sufficiently serious to expect that Mr Townsend will be retrenched. It is a very serious misjudgment of his role to act in ways that are contrary to the wishes of the government and in ways that are contrary to the Territory Plan&mdash;a plan which has been endorsed not only by the territory government but also by the Commonwealth government. I am glad to say that the inquiry has made recommendations of ways to avoid such policies in the future, including the preparation of employment policies for the new town centres. I hope that that will quickly be undertaken. </PARA>

Westpac's frenzied attempts to prevent disclosure of the infamous Westpac letters which referred to Westpac's curious and dubious foreign currency loans was one of Australia's biggest banking scandals in the 1980s and has not yet been resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to traverse issues relating to a dispute between Westpac and an aggrieved litigant, Drambo Pty Ltd, in Westpac's biggest foreign exchange case which is now before the Federal Court in Brisbane. However, I do wish to refer to Westpac's legal firm in Brisbane, Feez Ruthning, which in November 1995 wrote four letters to people it suspected&mdash;I emphasise `suspected'&mdash;were financial supporters of a Federal Court suit against Westpac. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to press reports, Westpac identified these persons by having a partner of the firm of Feez Ruthning, Mr Richard Gaven, attend the court hearing at which the case was being heard. Westpac may have also used its access to its clients' banking records to determine whether payments had been made, which is a breach of banker-client confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter claimed that it would seek orders to disclose the identity of supporters of the action and quoted Singh and Another v. Observer 1989 as the legal justification for its action. The letter from Westpac's solicitors reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand that you may have been involved in funding the applicants action against the bank. Enclosed for your information is a copy of a letter we sent to the solicitors for the applicant on the 30 March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This letter serves to give you notice that if the bank is successful in this litigation it will be seeking to recover its cost from any company or person who may have funded the applicants litigation.</PARA>
<PARA>A further letter from Feez Ruthning stated the letter was not meant to be `in terrorem' or intimidating, which is precisely the aim of the letters&mdash;to intimidate third parties from supporting the case against Westpac. The letter fails to acknowledge the elementary distinction that financing an action is different from being involved in litigation and that those seeking to financially assist the action against Westpac are therefore not liable to costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the four letters claimed that the authority for Westpac's action was a case of Singh and others v. Observer, 1989, in England. However, the letter, deliberately or through ignorance of the law, failed to point out that that particular case was overturned on appeal in 1989. I have received advice that Westpac and its solicitors face the grave charges of being in breach of sections 132 and 140 of the Criminal Code; having demonstrated contempt of the Federal Court; breaching section 52 of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct; and being in breach of section 51A of the Trade Practices Act with regard to unconscionable conduct and section 60 of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits coercive conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 132 and 140 are particularly relevant. Section 132 refers to a person who attempts in any way to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice as being guilty of a misdemeanour. Section 140 of the Criminal Code refers to the law that any person who conspires with another to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice is also guilty of a misdemeanour. Those sections of the Criminal Code carry terms of imprisonment of two years imprisonment with hard labour and seven years imprisonment with hard labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the letters are intended to defeat the ultimate course of justice by attempting to ensure the abandonment of the case against Westpac. Westpac is, or should be, bound by legislation to observe and adhere to the Banking Act 1959. This act regulates banking to make provision for protection of the currency and of the public credit of the Commonwealth. Part 1 of the Banking Act specifically nominates the interpretation of `prudential matters' in relation to a bank, meaning that the bank should keep itself in a sound financial position, not cause or promote financial instability in the Australian financial system and act with prudence, integrity and professional skill. It is a function of the Reserve Bank to monitor prudential matters, which include the encouraging and evaluating of sound practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, several persons have declined to provide further funding to assist the case against Westpac as a result of receiving one of these intimidating letters. It is time that Westpac recognised the corporate laws and the courts of Australia. Westpac has a profit of $1 billion per year, yet it intimidates those who have the courage to question its dubious operations which have left too many Australians disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should, by decisive action, at least ensure that Westpac is prevented from further illegal and malicious actions. Sympathetic consideration should be given to the granting of legal aid for those individuals who are attempting to pursue justice against Westpac. The investigatory and regulatory powers of the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission should also be used to ensure that Westpac is made accountable for its actions and that Westpac will cease its program of intimidation against honest Australians. To date, requests for assistance to the TPC and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) have not been replied to. Does the government therefore implicitly support the intimidatory tactics of Westpac and its solicitors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another matter that has been before the Supreme Court of Queensland, before Justice Mackenzie, Mr Lionel Potts had the unfortunate experience of also dealing with Westpac in another foreign loans scandal. The applicant won his case against Westpac and that judgment was subsequently overturned by the appeal court on a two to one verdict. Mr Potts has claimed in his affidavit that four bank officers referred to in this affidavit by their actions created doubt and conflicting views in the minds of the appeal judges. Two of these bank officers, Messrs Imhoff and Look, involved in this case have also appeared as witnesses in other trials related to foreign currency scandals. Westpac has lost every other trial: the Chirabagalio, Potts, Thannhauser and Ferneyhough cases. Westpac lost its appeal against Chirabagalio, won its appeal against Potts and did not appeal the Thannhauser and Ferneyhough decisions. These tactics are obviously meant to deter and harass other litigants by maintaining the Potts appeal judgment as a last full court foreign loans scandal in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank officers' actions resulted in the overturning of Justice Mackenzie's judgment, even though the trial judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. Mr Potts claims the innuendo and misrepresentations were calculated to mislead and pervert the course of justice. The Potts case is another example of Westpac acting as the `ugly Australian' by refusing to provide Mr Potts with a Singapore bank account statement, even though Mr Potts requested it as part of the discovery process. Westpac would only provide copies of the transactions that transpired in the offshore borrowing with the Singapore branch of Westpac. I ask: was there a legitimate bank account or were other transactions not known to Mr Potts recorded or registered against that account? Mr Potts's loan was purported by Westpac to have been made from the bank's Singapore branch. Mr Potts claimed that the Singapore branch is not a separate identity and is therefore not properly constituted as a licensed bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the early 1980s, as we are all aware, the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deregulated the banking system. The sky was the limit for Westpac to lend to Australians from Singapore. Until proven otherwise, much of it may have been using Australian dollars disguised as a foreign currency. If Mr Potts is correct, the Westpac Singapore branch under the governance of Westpac head office in Australia had no legal ability to make such a loan to Mr Potts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Potts sought special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia which was ultimately refused. Mr Potts subsequently settled the appeal process by agreeing to participate in an agreement for a binding expert determination of the dispute with Westpac which was signed on 4 February 1994. Westpac and Mr Potts agreed to Sir Laurence Street acting as a consultant to both parties. He would then resolve the dispute by issuing a certificate stating his determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Laurence Street, by signing an acceptance of this agreement, required each party to agree to comply with such requests that were in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Part D of this agreement states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parties agreed to accept the determination in the said certificate as final and binding.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Laurence Street proceeded with the determination and on 2 September Feez Ruthning, acting on behalf of Westpac, wrote to Sir Laurence Street. This letter is very important. It proves a lack of integrity and prudence of the bank officials who instructed their solicitors with no regard for justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter attempts to discard Mr Potts's right to submit further evidence to be placed before Sir Laurence Street for determination of the quantum losses which Mr Potts considered just as the Justice MacKenzie and Chief Justice McCrossan figures in their judgment did not reflect an accurate assessment of his real losses in dealing with Westpac. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Feez Ruthning stated the question for determination be limited to a finding as to whether there is any `new material or matter' as set out in the schedule to the agreement signed on 4 February 1994. They also argued that the agreement does not invite or require any reconsideration of the question of quantum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 September 1994 Mr Potts responded to the Feez Ruthning letter protesting it as being deceitful and as having him lulled into the belief that Sir Laurence Street would fully determine the issue of negligence by both Westpac and its officers. Mr Potts expressed disillusionment with the unethical behaviour of Westpac by its attempt to resolve the determination exclusively in its favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 October, Sir Laurence Street handed down his certified determination of the dispute. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is new material or matter which has emerged as at 10 November 1992, mainly the decision of the High Court in Wardley's case on 28 October 1992 which leads to the conclusion that the majority decision of the full court of the Supreme Court of Queensland was wrong in the sense that the said decision would have been different if this new material or matter had been before the full court.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Potts's lawyers, Bowdens, wrote to Westpac's solicitors quoting the Feez Ruthning letter of 2 November 1994 which contained the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We [Westpac] agreed to accept Sir Laurence's decision and have thereof restated our willingness to pay you in terms of that decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Bowdens stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view, `in terms of that decision' means something other than what has been offered by your client in their letter to our client dated 31 October 1994. It is our contention that Sir Laurence Street was intending that subsequent upon his determination there should be an assessment of damages based upon the plaintiff's claim under the Trade Practices Act which claim that Justice MacKenzie wrongly held was time barred. The sum plus interest would, in accordance with calculations made by Hall Chadwick, exceed $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 November 1995, Westpac wrote to Mr Potts repeating an offer of $193,333.30 on the basis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that you are prepared to accept this offer to settle the matter once and for all without any further negotiation. It is pointless for you to make any further contact with any of the bank's directors or officers. All such communications will be ignored and further correspondence will be returned to you.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, the arrogance of Westpac is unprecedented. It is obvious that Westpac has learnt nothing and nor has its conduct changed. Westpac still pursues its favoured course of intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament has supposedly enacted legislation to protect Australians from the type of actions I have outlined today. It is about time that this parliament in its proper democratic function put party politics aside and showed its wisdom and power to call Westpac to account. Parliament should take this action through an appropriate standing or select committee by establishing a banking inquiry into the nature of illegitimate Westpac banking actions and their consequences. Such an inquiry will provide a forum in which Australians can tender their evidence for consideration without having to face the fear and intimidation as used by Westpac in the Drambo and Potts cases. In doing this, parliament also has to consider the most practical manner to compensate victimised Westpac clients for losses incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Banking officials who hide behind the corporate veil of a major bank and conspire to pervert the course of justice must be called to account. Corporate intimidation is simply not acceptable in a civilised and law based society. The time has also come for the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to investigate these claims, as many Australians have suffered enough from the impunity of Westpac's misleading small and medium business proprietors&mdash;especially those who borrowed offshore, whether with or against the advice of greedy bankers, in the 1980s&mdash;over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians have lost their homes, many lies have been told, and many jobs and business opportunities have been lost due to Westpac's present new business practices. Sir Eric Neal, past chairman of Westpac, is quoted as referring to an inscription on an early Wales Bank note. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us possess the public confidence so long as, by faithful discharge of the honourable trust reposed in us, we may show ourselves worthy of it. Where any one man says with truth "the bank has broken faith with us", be then our ruin, and as only, the immediate consequences.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the 1980s, the conduct of Westpac directors, servants and agents has allowed Westpac to illegally deduct and retain moneys from borrowers' transactions, claiming these moneys were required to fund withholding tax, when there was no legal requirement to do so. It appears impossible for some senior bank officers to avoid charges relating to breaching the various banking, criminal and trade practices acts. Obviously, these officers have conspired to defraud these clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Treasurer: when was Westpac's banking licence reviewed, and when will it be reviewed next? Westpac should be renamed `the ugly Australian'. It is not a matter of changing the corporate image of Westpac; the Westpac culture needs root and branch investigation by the appropriate authorities, to ensure that it acts in the interests of its customers and shareholders and, above all, to ensure that Westpac obeys the corporate laws of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the redistribution in 1991, Macarthur once again became a marginal seat, with the northern suburbs of Wollongong reverting to the electorate of Cunningham. The former member for Macarthur, now the Speaker of this House (Mr Martin)&mdash;who lives in Wollongong&mdash;indicated that he would seek Labor endorsement for Cunningham against the sitting member, Mr Stewart West. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was then a Campbelltown City Council alderman, a federal public servant and a trade unionist. Having always been primarily interested in federal policy issues, I watched the redistribution process with interest. It was inevitable that there would be significant boundary changes in a rapidly growing area such as Macarthur. So, when the likely new boundaries became clear, I announced that I would seek federal Labor preselection for Macarthur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time, it seemed that I would be the only candidate, but eventually a number of other local branch members entered the race. It became obvious that many prominent ALP people, particularly within the New South Wales Right, considered that Macarthur was unwinnable. This was despite the Mackerras pendulum estimate of Macarthur as a 2.6 per cent Labor seat. This figure was actually wrong, as there had been an error in apportioning postal votes from the previous election. The real margin was more like one per cent to Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this, many people&mdash;including self-appointed experts such as Michael Knight, the state member for Campbelltown&mdash;made it clear that they considered Macarthur unwinnable for Labor. This may explain why neither the Right nor the Left in New South Wales became involved in the Macarthur 1992 preselection&mdash;at least not in the way in which factions normally do become involved in preselections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although a member of the Left, I neither sought nor received support on a factional basis in the preselection which I ultimately won in June 1992. I took my chances with the local branch members in a rank and file preselection ballot, bearing in mind that in areas like Macarthur the further away you get from the Sydney GPO, the less relevant factions become. These members at the time were genuine, ordinary Labor Party branch members who were not particularly interested in party factionalism. I won that preselection on the basis of my track record of service to my union and the Labor Party, my local government experience and my commitment to social justice issues and policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, not many people thought that we could win Macarthur. Despite the predictions of gloom and doom, I always believed that I had a good chance of winning Macarthur for the ALP. Ironically, four days after I announced that I would seek preselection&mdash;that was on 17 November 1991&mdash;the coalition launched Fightback, with the GST and all, on 21 November. Unlike many others, I never believed that the Australian people would embrace the GST or Fightback, and I campaigned accordingly. I believed that under a new Prime Minister, Paul Keating, Labor had a chance to steer away from economic rationalism and show a clear contrast with the coalition, something which had been lacking for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Macarthur is an area of young people and families, I was always confident that we would succeed with such a campaign, and that is what ultimately happened, although for a long period before the election it seemed that I had very little support from within the party. Once the election was called for 13 March, I did receive significant support from a number of trade unions, in particular the CFMEU and the Miscellaneous Workers Union. But it was also clear that a number of people within the Labor Party, particularly in Campbelltown, having predicted my defeat, were trying to ensure that their prediction would be right. I might return to that topic another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was elected on 13 March 1993 as the member for Macarthur. But this did not satisfy my detractors. It almost seems as though I provoked them. Suddenly, the same people who had been saying that I could not win the seat were saying that I should have won by a greater margin and that there had been a swing against Labor in Macarthur. This hypocrisy, which matched exactly the spin put on the result by the defeated Liberal candidate&mdash;you can understand the Liberals saying that, I guess&mdash;was based on the same erroneous Mackerras pendulum which showed Macarthur as a 2.6 per cent Labor seat. The margin now, of course, is 1.3 per cent. But, as I said earlier, the 2.6 per cent figure was wrong in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became obvious within weeks of my election that a campaign had already started within the Labor Party to undermine me and to defeat me at the next preselection. This is despite the fact that Macarthur was obviously&mdash;and still is&mdash;a marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go into a lot more detail about some of the bizarre incidents that occurred during those early weeks and months of my time in this place. I am also sorely tempted to name for the public record some of the people whom I know to be responsible for various actions, including the disgraceful ongoing smear campaign against me. However, I am torn between my desire to expose the truth for the public record and to bring people to account on the one hand and, on the other hand, my ultimate loyalty to the Labor movement and my desire not to see a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded, in fact, by the presence of the minister at the table, the Minister for Communications and the Arts and member for Dobell (Mr Lee), that in 1993 there was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, which was a profile on the minister at the table, in which he said, quite correctly, that, although our faction fights and internal differences are pretty hard fought in the Labor Party, at election time we forget that and get on with campaigning for the Labor candidate. I agree with the member for Dobell, as I said at the time in party meetings in my electorate, but unfortunately the same attitude was not adopted in 1993 or since by some of his factional colleagues in Campbelltown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because I do not wish to be accused of stooping to the same depths as some of those people, I will resist the temptation, at least for the time being, to take matters further. Nobody can ever accuse me of being disloyal to the Labor Party, which is more than I can say for some of those who have sought to destroy me and to damage my reputation. Suffice it to say at this stage that there was a huge branch-stacking campaign undertaken against me, which I believe was an abuse of ALP rules, quite apart from the fact that many of those recruited seem to have nothing in common with Labor objectives and have probably never voted Labor in their lives. If the Liberal Party in Western Australia thinks that it has problems with Noel Crichton-Browne, I can assure the opposition that there is more than one Noel Crichton-Browne in the political parties in this country. I might leave it at that. </PARA>

But no matter how angry Labor supporters are, the reality is this: a coalition government would indeed be far worse. Perhaps voters who are disillusioned with both major parties might look to a third alternative, such as Independents, Democrats or Greens.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message for the Labor Party and the government is this: in 1993, as I said earlier, we won because we showed we were different from the coalition.

But, in this era of economic rationalism, competition policy, privatisation and support for market forces&mdash;ahead of concern for social justice&mdash;it is again difficult for many people to tell the difference between the two major parties.

But I do not really mean `good luck', because that is one area where there is indeed a probability that Labor will show the differences between us and the coalition, and we will probably win the election accordingly. I hope that Labor does win the election.

This year, 1995, marks the year that Australia remembers the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and the huge sacrifices made by Australians during the torrid years of war 50 years ago. We remember the quality of the mostly young Australians who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country and the security they provided for their families, my family and, I am sure, all families within our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should never forget the charity of those heroes, their sacrifice, their hope for the future and their desire to provide a free and vital society for future generations. The very values which these heroes held so dear 50 years ago, which are so easily ridiculed by so many commentators and extreme members of this place&mdash;mostly from the other side, I might note&mdash;are values which we should also always hold dear. We should never forget the place of those heroes in history and, this year, we have remembered their efforts of half a century ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has also been a year of election speculation&mdash;speculation which has now been shown to be part of the silly political game so many of us participate in&mdash;a game which has seen many Australians wish for an early election, so we can move on and not waste valuable months in not being sure about our future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the choice Australians will make, whenever we have an election, is no game. It is possibly the most significant decision, since the war, that voters will make about the type of government they want to lead them into the 21st century. The next election will be full of rhetoric, mostly from the government&mdash;as we have seen already. As we saw at the last election, this government is probably best known for the breaking of promises. This election will be full of the usual Labor political tricks and deceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the next election will mark a clear choice for Australians. The decision we will make next year will be a choice between the past and the future, between the lies and betrayal of the past and the promise and responsibility of the future, between the lost fortune of the past and the demands and opportunities of the future. Sometimes we are asked to pay the price to attain the things that we strive for. For Australia this election is such a time. Are we prepared to pay the price? Are we prepared to pay the price to rid ourselves of a decade of the Labor government's abuse of power, of Labor's neglect of the broader community, and Labor's betrayal of the very qualities and values those Australian heroes fought for so valiantly 50 years ago?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Cowan, for instance, we have appalling levels of youth unemployment; 16 per cent of our young people in Cowan are unemployed. We have social security recipients, such as single parents, caught in the web of poverty and living below those standards set so proudly by the last generation. We have a community living in fear in Cowan, too scared to venture out after dark or use the various forms of public transport. We have struggling families in Cowan, trying to make ends meet, who are discriminated against by this government in relation to child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a community badly in need of improved facilities, such as child-care and youth facilities. We have a growing population of homeless youth in Cowan. How, in a country so rich as Australia, can we have this sorry incidence of youth homelessness in our country? It is a disgrace which is a growing legacy of this Labor government. We have a growing ethnic community in Cowan which is denied equal access and equity to mainstream services. We have an Aboriginal community in Cowan, which in a recent survey was considered to be the poorest area of Perth, which goes without adequate funding from this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cowan has been a region of neglect over eight years of Labor rule prior to 1993 by both the federal government and the previous state government. A cursory study of historical <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> would indicate clearly that the region had been badly represented prior to 1993, but since that time most of these important issues have been addressed in this place. Cowan is just a small example of the neglect the Labor government has shown to all of Australia in its 13 years of rule</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: are we prepared to pay the price to restore good fortune to the Australian people, to provide a future full of hope and opportunities? Are we prepared to pay the price to rid the community of a government that lies to us, that removes the will to prosper, that threatens our future by destroying the hopes of our young, and will do whatever it takes to retain power?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we believe the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he says one thing and then does the direct opposite? Can we ever believe this Prime Minister again? This is the Prime Minister who promised l-a-w tax cuts, and then raised sales tax on almost every product in Australia, the Prime Minister who promised not to increase the Medicare levy&mdash;as did the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;and then increased it. It should not shock those who follow royal commissions, particularly those who followed the recent Marks royal commission in Western Australia, to find out that the minister for health had been untruthful on that occasion. She was certainly untruthful when she said she would not increase the Medicare levy, and did so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we believe the Prime Minister who promised to reduce company tax, did so and then put it back up a year or two later? Can we believe the Prime Minister who promised to take all age pensioners from the income tax regime and then kept them within the tax net? I think it took about three days after the last election for that promise to be broken. Can we believe the Prime Minister who promised to reduce foreign debt and then raised debt to record levels? Can we ever believe again a Prime Minister who promised a surplus budget for this year but it is now seen to be in deficit? The simple answer for many Australians as confirmed by the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today is, `No, we can never do so again. We can never believe this Prime Minister or this government again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we prepared to allow at the head of our country's affairs a Labor Party that has been proven many times to be corrupt, has lied to us, continues to lose control of financial matters and has had former leaders gaoled for stealing public and other funds? Can we accept the doubtful claims of the Labor government that we Australians have never had it so good? Can we entrust the nation's economy to a party that ruined four state economies, took us into a recession and now is so out of control in managing prosperity that it is willing to lead us back into recession?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the Australian people ever have the confidence to trust the Labor Party, a party for true believers, which deliberately and needlessly created the worst unemployment figures in Australia since the war, driving a stake to widen the gap between rich and poor? Would we trust our international affairs to the thought police of the Labor government which is willing to sell our community values to international bodies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can we trust this government to be serious about human rights when it allows the continued degradation of our Aboriginal people, our indigenous people? Are we not the sons and daughters of the previous generation which fought and worked so hard to provide a nation so full of promise and opportunity? This is a nation rich with assets, a nation which cries out to progress; yet, as we have seen over the last few days in industrial relations, we are going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a nation which has been betrayed and destroyed by the Labor Party, a Labor Party which has lowered standards, destroyed hope for our young and developed a growing wedge of conflict within the community. The light on the hill so much wanted by the true believers has been snuffed out for all time through their disappointment at their betrayal by this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have a chance at the next election to redefine and redirect our future away from the politics of hate and division that are provided so easily by the Labor Party. Anyone who listened to the speech by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) earlier on would agree that that particular member is an example of hate and division whenever he gets up and speaks in this place. Such politics cut across the grain of all things that characterise the Australian spirit. My colleagues and I within the coalition are absolutely committed to restoring the Australian people to their rightful place in their own country as participants and partners in government rather than frustrated onlookers of their future. We want Australians back in the business of running Australia and therefore owning Australia and its future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that, of the great wealth of our country, the characteristic that stands out above all else is the Australian people's desire for social equity, opportunity and prosperity, individuality and a sense of community. These are the values that have been betrayed by the Labor Party. A lot of commentators, particularly the self-described rabid feminist Eva Cox, ridicule these values as part of the traditional values, but values such as honesty, integrity, charity, respect and responsibility are all traditional values. These are the values which patriots in the past have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect. Yet we have these self-proclaimed experts who believe that the values are old world. They are not old world; they are current world, new world and something to aspire to. It is then obvious that we are at a defining point in our history: do we acknowledge our past and the freedoms of choice provided to us or move to the vile community of cynicism, dishonesty in our leaders and a community of fear and hate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995 the Prime Minister and other fellow travellers have presented to us their picture of Australia and how we have supposedly benefited greatly from Labor in power. They have waxed lyrical about the achievements of the Labor Party and how Australia is apparently winning. Some say winners are grinners, yet when one reviews those Australians that have been grinning over the past decade it is quite obscene to see that it has been only the favoured ones, the mates of Labor, that grin. Australian families right now are not grinning. Young Australians have not got much to smile about. Small business in Australia is not smiling. In fact, the smile has been wiped from the faces of many Australians who remain very concerned about their future, and again I refer to today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media may be seduced by the Labor Party's ways, their smooth talk and their taxpayer funded media unit, but those Australians that care about their country will not be enticed by their snake oil sales pitch. The Labor Party story is well worn, it is tired and it is a bunch of rhetorical untruths. By contrast, despite what the media and others would have you believe, the coalition offers the Australian people security, social equity, opportunity, reward for endeavour, and a future our community and, more importantly, our nation's children can have confidence in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition want to give renewed meaning to being Australian and capture the Australian spirit which cries out to be heard. Gone will be the politics of deceit and government of favourites and mates. We want to provide liberty, equality and humanity, the very essence and foundation of liberalism. As previously announced, our election program will have some great aims. Some of them are these. We will commit to responsible economic management to give hope for our future by reducing our national debt, which is a disgrace; to give Australians choice at the workplace, which in recent times has been taken from them; to liberate small business people, farmers and small investors; to allow federalism to work and to reduce wasted funds and confusion which result from duplication of government services; to embrace the 21st century and the technological and information age; to allow all Australians to enjoy the fruits of our nation's sustainable resource development; to give Australian families a fair go; to give the Australian community ownership of their future and involve them in the decision making processes of our country; to give Australia back to Australians and to liberate our national identity from international authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the coalition will put people, Australian people, first. All of us have to insist that we can do much better as a nation. We must pay the price. We must reject the policies that subsidise indolence and apathy. We ought to be determined to change the direction of the wasteful Labor government, wasting the resources of our great nation. The greatest resource the Labor government wastes is the skill and the endeavour of our own people. A country as rich and as skilled as ours should never be producing so much inequality, so much poverty, so much injustice. Let us not continue the neglect and deceit of the Labor Party, where our youth are at risk, where our single parent families are left to wallow in the depths of despair through their poor status, where jobs are constantly at risk, as identified in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today, and where our education system is not providing for our future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great faith in the Australian spirit, the spirit of a fair go based upon integrity and honesty&mdash;the very values ridiculed by those in the Labor government who would have us believe that dishonesty of a minister is okay. Honesty is not a value to be played on the political stage. What do our children think when they hear it is okay for a minister of government, someone to be respected, to lie? What standards is the Labor Party subscribing to when it accepts lying amongst its members? I believe the Australian community has had enough of being taken for granted, of being lied to. They want better than what the Labor Party is offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe Australia needs a new direction, new management, and new policies that liberate and reward. Mr Speaker, will you believe with me that our country can be rejuvenated, to provide a hope and future for ourselves and our children? To want less is a tragedy and a betrayal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I entered parliament, some three years ago, I wanted to serve the community to the very best of my ability. I believe my role as the member for Cowan is to provide a voice to those Australians who want to be heard. The values of the Cowan constituents, which they strive for, are mine. The hopes and dreams that they have for their families and their country are also mine. I believe I have represented their worries and their concerns about the future, which are also mine. I think I have represented them here in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But my will for them is not enough. My desire, my enthusiasm and my energy for them are not enough. What Australia now needs are patriots to stand and say that enough is enough. We have had enough of the lies, enough of reducing standards, enough of the collapsing youth employment market, enough of community division, and enough of the Australian Labor Party and their government for the few&mdash;their government of hate and division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs a new generation of heroes to stand up for their country as they did so willingly 50 years ago. We need a new generation to provide patriotism and fight the enemies&mdash;intolerance and reducing standards. We need them to fight for the future by rejecting Labor at the forthcoming election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Deputy Speaker, 1995 is a year to remember those who defended our heritage 50 years ago and the price they paid for our future. Let it also be remembered for the price we will pay for the future of our children. Let us all pay the price and reject the Labor government at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose some of the matters that the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) mentioned need to have a little bit of comment made on them. It never ceases to amaze me that in this House, day after day, one hears members of the opposition responding to their leader's mantra, which was, `The times will suit me.' What their leader meant by that was that he hoped that Australia would be in a trough at the time of the election and, at that time, it would suit people to change their votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to that mantra, of course, what we find from the opposition is this continual talking-down of Australia. There is continual talking-down of their country and of the hopes and aspirations of people, just for a bit of cheap political gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition do not realise&mdash;and the Australian people do realise&mdash;is that there are a lot of good things going on out there in the community. There is a lot of progress being made. Australia is being dragged out of the very old-fashioned views that the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) would have us take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is doing its best to try to turn Australia into a country that is outward-looking rather than inward-looking, robust rather than weak, and willing to grasp opportunities rather than hide behind protective barriers. The government is also looking to do things that will help the future of Australia, rather than just trying to hark back to the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those areas where the government has done a lot of good has been the area of the environment, which has become one of the top issues on the agenda of the government and Australia, if for no other reason than that our environment in Australia has been recognised as a resource of great value. The recent ranking of Australia as first, in world terms, in terms of per capita wealth was achieved by incorporating our rich natural resources. Tourism is shaping up as our No. 1 industry, and central to tourism is the maintenance of our natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is providing $10 million over four years for the national ecotourism program to assist in the implementation of the national ecotourism strategy. The government has integrated its commitment to the environment and to employment programs, with our green jobs program which will create around 5,000 jobs in this financial year and 10,000 jobs per annum in ensuing years. The government can stand proudly on its environmental record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government has done a great deal in this area. Australia is recognised internationally as a world leader in the management and protection of World Heritage areas. Some outstanding examples of these are the Franklin River, Uluru and the Daintree. There has been a $53 million package for the national coastcare program to support community projects protecting Australia's important and beautiful coastal environments. There is no question but that the government has committed itself to sustainable development, whereas 20 years ago, in the days that the opposition would hark back to, governments would decide that a development was a good idea economically and basically would go ahead with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days, we are a lot wiser. We realise that industry, mining, construction and other developments have a cost beyond capital set-up, running and labour costs. They also have an environmental cost, and this is something that needs to be considered right at the start of a project, not when the factory has been built or the open-cut mine has been operating for some years. It is important to sketch a quick picture of the government's approach and its thinking on the environment, and the development that the government has been involved in over the last decade. When people look for inspiration, one of the most inspiring points of view that the Labor government has taken has been in the area of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other matters I would like to discuss in this debate as well. The first is telecommunications and specifically the roll-out of cable. The government has made sure that Australia is in the best position to capitalise on the communications and information revolution. We have opened up the industry to competition, to make sure that people across Australia will have a better service and lower prices. The government has agreed that it is vital to our future that Australians have equity of access to the means of communication and of obtaining information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that this is something that has happened and is happening. From 1993-94, the cost of international calls has dropped by nine per cent and the cost of domestic long-distance calls has dropped by six per cent. This is a great thing for people, both socially and economically. The distance between Australia and the rest of the world is getting smaller, as is the distance across our vast land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get down to the nitty-gritty of how those leaps in telecommunications are physically taking place. Everyone knows that communications technology is getting better day by day and that we can communicate faster, more cheaply and more easily than before. To assess the benefits of this improved technology, though, we have to have the infrastructure to carry it. We need to have the lines, the cabling running past our homes and businesses to carry all this communication and information. There are great benefits but also environmental costs in achieving this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have been sold on the vision of the information superhighway and the interactivity that it offers with pay TV, home shopping, videoconferencing, the Internet and high-speed links. What they have not been sold is the physical intrusion into their immediate environment that this vision entails. Foxtel and Optus Vision have been selling their pay TV services for quite a while now as something that is out there that is beamed into the lounge room. What they have not been selling to people is the digging up of their footpaths and the stringing up of more cables from telegraph poles outside their windows and the putting up of mobile phone towers wherever they feel like it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a simple reason why they have not been selling people this. It is because we have not forced them to. I think we have been too lenient on the carriers, on Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. We wanted a great thing for the people of Australia and that was access to the best communications system as soon as possible, but we placed a bit too much faith in the carriers to do this with sensitivity to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carriers are getting the infrastructure out there with great speed and I do not think the government has anything to complain about on that score. But what the community is starting to complain about is that carriers are not consulting with them about it. They are spending a fortune on ads on TV and in the papers about the amazing services they are going to provide but how much are they spending to let people know that they are going to erect a mobile phone tower down the road or get the cranes out to put up more black cables on telegraph poles?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, unfortunately, has not caused the carriers to be good, considerate corporate citizens and because we have not coerced them to be they have not. I must admit that I am quite surprised by the carriers' approach. When they are rolling out their infrastructure they view the community, the public, the local authorities, as impediments, as roadblocks on the way into their superhighway. But when the roll-out is finished they are turning around to the same people, that same community, that same public, and saying, `Please come and be our customers, we will treat you like gold. Our customer is the most important thing to us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am intrigued at the dichotomy of their approach. I have had some exposure to the approach of Optus. Since the recent outcry by the community and councils about the lack of consultation about cable roll-out, Optus has softened its approach slightly and given the appearance of taking these concerns into consideration. However, when you speak to the Optus people it is evident that, under the thin veneer of community consultation, their determination to bulldoze through with their roll-out is evident. They will go ahead and they will do what they want despite the objections and they will rely upon the authority that carriers have to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, Vodafone is one of the operators that has sometimes had scant regard for the people in the area where they intend to erect mobile phone towers. They tend to make the decision about the location before consulting with the community at all. It is a common thing for people to wake up in the morning and find that a tower is being erected in their neighbourhood that they have heard nothing about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that in the past the demonising of Telstra by other carriers and by, quite rightly, people in the community, would have made the new entrants into this market a bit more sensitive. I think the irony is that Telstra people have lifted their game and are becoming a bit more sensitive but at the same time the newer carriers are starting to learn the same old tricks that Telstra used to employ. I would have thought that it would have made good business sense for carriers to notify people in the areas where they are putting up their infrastructure and even to take that opportunity to inform them about the services they will be offering and maybe to gain some customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise that I am not attacking the principle of competition in the telecommunications industry, or the goal that we have of providing access to these services throughout Australia, and in particular in remote and rural areas. What I am expressing is surprise, and I must say regret, at the approach of the carriers in implementing this roll-out. It is regrettable that the carriers appear to have opted to comply only with the letter of the national code under which they are rolling out infrastructure rather than with the spirit of the code which was drafted to encourage a speedy roll-out for the benefit of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel is in the process of reviewing the operation of the code and it appears there will be some major modifications and tightening of provisions to ensure that the carriers do not ride roughshod over the communities they are proposing to serve in the future. I hope to see the new code establish more detailed procedures for consideration of environmental impact and health impact by the roll-out of infrastructure with a process for planning to enhance this without bringing the roll-out to a grinding halt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is too late to think about environmental considerations once the structures are there. Its impact on the environment must be assessed and options properly canvassed before work begins. All the carriers need to consult more widely with the communities that they wish to service and they must adopt a more conciliatory approach or otherwise the government will need to ensure that there is some mechanism to have this consultation occur. I have to say that we are at the stage where the government will need to take some approaches to curtail this laissez-faire approach that the carriers have at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to move from the question of the information superhighway to that of ordinary blacktop roads. Roads are becoming a vexed question in my electorate. Everyone uses them and wants better ones, of course, but no-one wants to pay for the building of them or to have them running past their homes. That is a classic example of the clash of economic and environmental concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983 the federal Labor government has spent $18.5 billion on road funding. In this budget we have proposed the allocation of $2.5 billion over the next three years for the national highway, along with $727.4 million in untied road grants to states and local authorities for this financial year. The government is addressing the problem of the impact of heavy freight vehicles on urban roads and the environment through a policy of constructing ring roads and freight routes to link highways and industrial freight generating areas, such as the orbital road in Western Sydney. This road will be vital to the linking of Sydney West Airport with the rest of Sydney and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example of the environmental problems with building roads, I would like to briefly talk about the difficulties we are having with the extension of the M5 motorway to the east, which will run through the heart of my electorate. This is a project begun by the previous Liberal government in New South Wales. There are a lot of people in my electorate who have problems with this road, not the least of whom are those whose homes will be resumed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier on in this program, we had a great victory in protecting the environmentally sensitive Wolli Creek area by having the road tunnelled under it. Unfortunately, while we have solved the problem of Wolli Creek and the horrific overpass that the Roads and Traffic Authority intended building in the Turrella area, there are still a number of problems with this proposal in terms of its impact on the environment and the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When completed, the road will carry a large number of heavy vehicles as it will link Sydney airport with the west. Residents are very concerned about the noise and air pollution impacts of these heavy vehicles, particularly around the King Georges Road intersection. At the moment, there is no proposal to tunnel under King Georges Road to avoid that intersection. Instead, there will be an overpass at the intersection which will mean that heavy trucks will have to stop at a toll plaza before the intersection, then roll down the hill to the intersection before screeching on their brakes and changing gear to go up the overpass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complex process of consultation on this issue has gone on for years. But, while the Roads and Traffic Authority is dealing with half the problem in tunnelling from Turrella to Bexley Road, it should really grasp the nettle in this issue and continue that tunnel all the way from Bexley Road up to King Georges Road. We would then find that there would be a very important piece of open space left for the people in that part of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, with a tunnel, we could ensure that we would do away with most of the environmental problems that come from the road and also ensure that people's lives are made that much better. The additional benefit for the people of my electorate would be a very large piece of open space which would benefit both present and future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of discussion and consideration needs to be given to the built environment in our cities. The two issues I have raised&mdash;the problems with large roads that go through residential areas and the difficulties that telecommunications carriers are causing&mdash;are problems that the national government needs to consider. But they are problems that need to be resolved by other levels of government. I commend these bills to the House and thank members for their interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This was the third meeting of leaders of the APEC economies. The process began with the meeting hosted by President Clinton in Seattle in 1993 following a proposal I had made, orally and by correspondence, with the other APEC leaders, for a leaders forum to empower the APEC process. It continued with the historic meeting chaired by President Soeharto in Indonesia a year ago, which produced the Bogor declaration. In that declaration the APEC economies committed themselves to the goal of free and open trade in the Asia-Pacific at the latest by 2010 for industrialised countries and 2020 for developing countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bogor goals were unprecedented and audacious. The challenge for APEC this year was to put in place at Osaka a plan of action which would show how the goals could be implemented. I believe the result in Osaka was an outstanding success. The plan of action and leaders declaration met all Australia's aims and have firmly cemented APEC as the key regional body for coordinating the development and growth of the Asia-Pacific into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has provided a framework which will ensure Australia's continuing and deeper integration into the dynamic region around us with all the economic, political and strategic benefits which follow from that. It is of deep and long-run significance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Osaka, the 18 APEC economies, which already account for 60 per cent of the world's GDP and half its trade, renewed their commitment&mdash;what the leaders declaration describes as their `unwavering resolve'&mdash;to free and open trade and investment in the APEC region by 2010/2020. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Osaka action agenda sets out the principles which will underpin the process of trade liberalisation and trade facilitation in the Asia-Pacific. The eight principles we have set down include WTO consistency, comparability, non-discrimination, transparency, standstill, and a commitment to move together in the liberalisation process. But a central principle for Australia is comprehensive coverage of all sectors and issues. This means that agriculture is firmly on the APEC agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was one of the most difficult issues we faced during the year. But as I told Prime Minister Murayama, MITI Minister Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Kono in several meetings over the past twelve months, it was an acid test of APEC's relevance not only to Australia but to developing agricultural producers like Thailand and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a real win for Australian farmers because it enables them to plan confidently for the opening up of the vast market around us and brings closer our vision of Australia as a global supplier of food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the principles, a process was agreed for liberalisation. Leaders directed ministers and officials to immediately begin the preparation of `concrete and substantive' action plans to be submitted to the 1996 ministerial meeting in the Philippines for assessment. Overall implementation of the plans will begin in January 1997, with annual reviews and improvements thereafter. Here I emphasise `begin'. The plans will be most detailed for the early years, but will stretch through to the 2010/2020 end dates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got two key things right about APEC. First, we know where we are going. We have decided on the end point we wish to reach&mdash;free and open trade and investment in the APEC region&mdash;and we have a process for getting there: concerted liberalisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an entirely new model for global trade liberalisation. It does not depend on the legalistic and adversarial approach of traditional trade rounds in which the incentive for negotiators was to keep their best cards in their pockets, ensuring that offers were therefore grudging and incomplete. It substitutes instead a new form of concerted individual movement in which peer pressure and self-interest will work hand in hand to maintain progress towards goals which have already been set; that is, the end goal having been set at the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing we have right in APEC is the regular involvement of leaders. Their meetings give the process an authority and drive which could never be matched by meetings of ministers alone. Their engagement invests the outcome of the annual discussions with a weight and authenticity which keeps it moving forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APEC process marks a very significant new development in trade negotiations. I suspect it is likely to prove much more relevant to the sort of global economy which is now developing&mdash;one in which Asian countries have an increasingly significant economic role; in which many more states need to be engaged in the process and have a stake in the outcome; and in which the role of developing countries like China and Indonesia will become more central. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of APEC's greatest values as an institution is that it is a practical example of north-south cooperation. It provides a framework for developed and developing economies to work together to liberalise and facilitate trade and investment and to promote economic and technical cooperation. It has been fundamental to the whole APEC outcome that  President Soeharto&mdash;the leader of one of the world's largest developing countries&mdash;has been one of the driving forces behind the liberalisation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaders did not only talk about principles and process at Osaka. They also delivered a package of initial actions&mdash;a `downpayment' on their Uruguay Round commitments&mdash;which demonstrates beyond question APEC's seriousness of purpose. For example, Japan announced the acceleration by approximately two years of its Uruguay Round tariff reduction commitments on items affecting trade worth Y10 billion as well as a substantial package of deregulation measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China announced that it would substantially reduce tariffs on over 4,000 tariff lines and will eliminate import control measures on about 170 tariff lines. The other APEC members, including Indonesia, all put good contributions on the table. Through these downpayments APEC has managed to do something the G7 members could not bring themselves to do earlier this year. APEC has become the principal catalyst for global trade liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Osaka meeting we urged other WTO members to match APEC's efforts. We also agreed to hold a meeting of APEC trade ministers next year to consider joint initiatives in advance of the first ministerial meeting of the WTO which will be held in December 1996 in Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these trade liberalisation measures, a number of important trade facilitation measures are also to be taken. For example, APEC will introduce a common harmonised system of tariff classifications by 1996, an internationally agreed standard electronic customs message system by 1999 and pilot mutual recognition agreements in the area of standards by 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are important benefits for the business community. Customs procedures alone can add 10 per cent to the cost of doing business and although tariffs in some parts of the APEC region remain high, the main impediments for many of our businesses are in the non-tariff area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APEC leaders also acknowledged the vital work the  business sector must play in APEC's work by agreeing to the recommendation from the Pacific Business Forum that we establish a permanent APEC Business Advisory Council, with its members to be appointed directly by leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to acknowledge here the outstanding work which Australia's representatives on the Pacific Business Forum, Ms Imelda Roche of Nutrimetics and Mr Philip Brass of Pacific Dunlop, have done for Australia and for the APEC region, and to thank them on the government's behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Eminent Persons Group has also made a very valuable contribution to APEC's development work; it set signposts along the way, and I again thank Mr Neville Wran for all his work over the past three years</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I announced during the Osaka meeting that in response to one of the recommendations of the Pacific Business Forum  Australia will introduce a business travel card to facilitate regional travel by accredited business people. We have also proposed that other APEC economies join us in this scheme. This will help greatly to facilitate the freer movement of business people around the region, and this of course will be of material assistance to mobility and to enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term benefits of APEC's trade liberalisation and facilitation are enormous. Recent modelling work undertaken by the Office of National Assessments and the Industry Commission backs up earlier conclusions and suggests that, when the full effects of the Bogor commitments have flowed through, the income of APEC members will increase by 3.8 per cent or $US745 billion&mdash;more than the current size of the Australian and Korean economies combined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians will benefit directly and substantially from this process. The initial results of the most recent modelling shows that Australia's real income will rise by 6.8 per cent or $40 billion when all the effects have flowed through, and that growth of this order can be expected to generate around 500,000 new jobs over the course of the liberalisation period. These revised figures on the benefits to Australia, which are the result of more comprehensive modelling, are substantially higher than those I gave the House in the statement I made after the Bogor declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the focus on APEC has concentrated on its trade liberalisation dimensions. These are central to APEC's work and are vital to the region's continuing prosperity. But APEC also has a number of other dimensions, including its important work in areas like education and training, science and technology, small and medium enterprises, transportation, telecommunications, tourism, economic policy and sustainable development. Cooperation in these areas is expanding quickly and we are seeing the development of much more intensive sets of linkages between APEC governments and businesses in all these new areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of APEC's major tasks&mdash;and one which was recognised by all the leaders at Osaka&mdash;will be to keep resources flowing to the rapidly growing East Asian economies, especially China, as the region's unprecedented growth continues. For example, East Asia's demand for energy is doubling every 12 years compared with the world average of every 28 years. China's demand for grains is growing so fast that its estimated shortage within 15 years could be three to six times Australia's total annual wheat production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC's infrastructure requirements over the next decade are likely to require $US2 trillion, of which well over $US500 billion will have to come from the private sector. The way we handle these requirements will affect not only the region's prosperity but also its security in the first part of the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the leaders meeting that Australia was ready to address the concerns which Japan, Korea and China have expressed about meeting their food needs. I suggested the creation of an APEC task force on food and agribusiness to examine regional food challenges into the next century. I will be writing shortly to my colleagues to follow that up and put some flesh on that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Bogor commitments are fully implemented, by the year 2020 APEC will account for more than three-quarters of global production and three-quarters of the world's trade. ASEAN's per capita incomes will be five times higher than they currently are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One enormously beneficial consequence of the establishment of this process and these APEC meetings is the opportunity it provides for closer contact between regional leaders. In addition to the discussions in the leaders meeting itself, I was able to hold very useful bilateral discussions with President Kim Young Sam of Korea, President Soeharto of Indonesia, President Zedillo of Mexico, President Jiang Zemin of China, Prime Minister Murayama of Japan, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, Prime Minister Banharn of Thailand, Prime Minister Bolger of New Zealand and Vice President Gore of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This meeting was a very great success for Prime Minister Murayama and the Japanese government, especially MITI Minister Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Kono who were most directly involved. Japan's leadership was very important in helping to shape this outstanding result, and I take this opportunity to congratulate them on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very confident that President Ramos of the Philippines, whom I had a number of discussions with over various luncheon and dinner opportunities, who will chair APEC in 1996, will continue this work. I have offered him any assistance Australia can provide. I would like also to take the opportunity here to mention the work of the officials of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in their collaborative work with their counterparts in Japan over the course of the year and, of course, their work with some of the officials from the other countries which have been engaged in the process. I think Australia's role in this, the fact that we not only have ideas but also can express them at official level, has very much helped this process over the course of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggested last year after the Bogor meeting that the establishment and development of APEC would rank with the establishment of the structures which grew from the Bretton Woods agreement after the Second World War as a model to serve the interests of a new world. After the meeting in Osaka I am more than ever convinced of the truth of this. With APEC heading for 75 per cent of world GDP and 75 per cent of world trade over the forecast period, and the contribution it is likely to make to it, I am sure this may well prove to be so. Australians can feel well pleased with APEC's progress and our own central role in developing it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I welcome the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding the meeting in Osaka. I also take the opportunity, again on behalf of the opposition, to express strong agreement with the government's goals and objectives in relation to the APEC arrangement. This is an important initiative. I certainly want to make it clear to the House that the goals of APEC are shared in common by both sides of the parliament. The Prime Minister has made a contribution to this process, as indeed did both of his predecessors, Bob Hawke and Malcolm Fraser, in their different ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goal of trade liberalisation in our region is one that all sensible Australians will aspire to, and the way in which successive governments of Australia go about achieving it will, in the years to come, be a very important measure of this country's sense of its own importance, its own destiny and its own role in this region. As the Prime Minister said, it does represent a very important north-south dialogue; it does bring together nations of vastly different cultures, of vastly different histories, with vastly different economies and with vastly different interests. If the goals of the APEC arrangement can be achieved by the designated years, then it will be a very particular tribute to the leadership skills of all those who have played and will play a role in the future in achieving those goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, as the Prime Minister has said, that the arrangements re-endorsed at Osaka do not contain any sectoral exclusions. It would have been quite unacceptable to both the Liberal and National parties as well as the government if there had been any suggestion that agriculture be in any way excluded, on the basis of some kind of different sectoral approach. I welcome the fact that there has been absolutely no reference at all to that in the final understandings that emerged from the agreement. Regional trade liberalisation does need to be conducted on an open, non-discriminatory basis&mdash;and the goals, as I said, are very important and laudable goals to which we all aspire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been said in Osaka and what was contained in the Bogor declaration represent a statement of goals and a statement of objectives. Thus far, everybody can feel well pleased, with a sense of purpose and a sense of having made progress. The real test will begin in 1996 when, in accordance with the Prime Minister's statement, it will be necessary for concrete and substantive action plans to be submitted to the 1996 ministerial meeting in the Philippines for assessment. It is at that point that the bold language and the laudable objectives which have come out of the two meetings referred to in the Prime Minister's statement will really be put to the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say, without gainsaying the positive goals contained in APEC, that many Australian exporters within the region still feel that amassed against them are a large number of both tariff and non-tariff barriers. There are many Australian exporters who feel that the practice of freer trade thus far has been rather one-sided so far as the Australian manufacturers and Australian exporters are concerned. If, as a consequence of the maturation of the APEC process, that attitude changes and those barriers begin to come down and those restrictions begin to disappear, then those exporters and those manufacturers will have every reason to feel well pleased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, as part of the understanding reached in Japan, countries made what were called `downpayments' on their Uruguay Round commitments, which included a contribution from Australia as well as contributions from Japan, China and other APEC countries. I guess I would be speaking of behalf of many Australian exporters in the region, many Australian business men and women who have responded to the exhortation of both government and opposition alike to become heavily involved in trade in the region, if I expressed the view and the hope that they get the benefit of some of those downpayments from those other countries in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the region, it is important that we preserve a sense of perspective. We ought to remember that it is undeniably the fastest growing economic region in the world. It is also undeniable that Australia's share of East Asian imports has dropped 20 per cent in the last 10 years; that since 1983 we have lost some market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei; and that our merchandise trade surplus with the APEC region has declined from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95. This is not to gainsay in any way the goal of the APEC arrangement; it is merely to preserve a sense of perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also necessary, in the interests of preserving a sense of perspective, to bear in mind that we should never make the error of placing all of our trade eggs in the one basket. We should remember that this country, as well as having major enduring and unarguable economic interests and economic links with the region, has very strong economic linkages with the rest of the world. It is worth recalling in that context some recent figures released by the government's own statistical collection base, which indicated that over the last five to 10 years there had been a dramatic widening in the proportionality of direct investment from Australia into North America and Europe as compared with direct investment into the countries in our immediate region. I acknowledge that included amongst the APEC countries are the nations of North America but, of course, not the nations of Europe. I simply make that point not to gainsay the importance of the APEC arrangement but to inject, I hope, a sense of balance into the discussion of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is an important vision for this country to have these kinds of economic linkages and economic involvement with the nations of our region and the nations of the Pacific. I share the Prime Minister's vision&mdash;as he described it, `our vision of Australia as a global supplier of food'. That has a strange resonance with some remarks I used yesterday when I addressed the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation, where I expressed the view of the coalition that we saw with appropriate domestic policies that Australia might indeed become the supermarket to Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of appropriate domestic economic policies, it is worth while reminding ourselves that, in order to derive the full benefit that the APEC goal and the APEC vision offers Australia, it will be necessary for our own domestic economic house to be in better order than it is at present. It is wrong to imagine that, because you live cheek by jowl with the fast growing region in the world, you automatically get a share of the action. There is only earned action in international trade; there is no automatic market share. You have to go out and fight for your market share, and in order to fight effectively for that market share you need to be more competitive than this country is at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we think of the hope that APEC offers to Australia, the opportunity it offers, and the enthusiasm that is shared across the political divide in this parliament, it is worth while remembering that we will only enjoy the benefits of APEC, if it does reach full maturation, if we have demonstrated through our own domestic economic performance that we are equal to the task of winning on our own merits and in our own right an effective market share of that very burgeoning economic area of the world. I welcome the Prime Minister's statement. I assure the House that the goals are shared in common. They are important goals. Whatever caveats I have entered in these brief remarks are not caveats in any way, in any sense, begrudging the goals and the vision of APEC; rather, I hope they are recognising some fundamental realities that people ultimately respond when performance is delivered rather than goals and objectives stated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1995-96 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1995-96. It gives me an opportunity to speak on a number of issues facing the electorate of the Riverina.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue I would like to touch on is emergency services in the region. During recent discussions with representatives from the police, the fire service, the ambulance service, and the State Emergency Service a number of matters came to the fore. An important issue, given the number of transport vehicles travelling through the Riverina, is the transport and storage of hazardous materials. Following a recent transport accident in the area, an inspection of the truck's manifest indicated that the load included some chemicals classified as hazardous materials. As a result, it was necessary to call in officers from the Environment Protection Agency. Firemen were called to work for long periods in fully encapsulated suits and the road, which was a major arterial road, was closed to through traffic for a lengthy period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, it was determined that the goods shown on the manifest were not in fact on the truck involved in the accident. It appears it is still legal to show on the manifest goods that are not on the load. It is only when hazardous materials are being carried without being shown on the manifest that an offence is committed. A false or incorrect manifest can cause many problems and cost the community dearly in the use of manpower and delays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine the work done and the frustration experienced by just one person in a protective suit, in the middle of summer, walking the required distance to the accident scene and working to clean up what was thought to be a hazardous chemical spill, only to learn that the spill was harmless. We would all appreciate it and be grateful if the spill was harmless, but the strain on those persons cleaning up the mess would be extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer may be the standardisation of manifests throughout Australia, and a colour code may be the way to go. Recently a State Rail carriage carrying hazardous waste was derailed, landing on its side. Would you believe it, the signage was located on the side of the railway truck that was on the ground and was therefore hidden. This placed those people working to right the carriage at risk because they were completely ignorant of the danger. Railway carriages carry potentially dangerous loads and should be signed on more than just one side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that there has been little progress to allow private citizens, particularly farmers, to dispose of dangerous chemicals unless they dangerously dump them in landfill sites. It is extremely difficult to dispose of these chemicals in any other way. Therefore, much of this chemical is stored in sheds in towns and cities and on farms. Governments have discussed waste incinerators as an option, but this option was abandoned because of public opposition. I am not aware of any other facility in existence, or proposed, that will alleviate this problem. There is always the risk that when firemen attend a fire in an urban, shearing, tractor or any other type of shed they are going into a potentially dangerous environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested that, as in some states, it be law that signage be used to signify the presence of hazardous materials on a property. I think we have all seen those signs. However, I cannot envisage a person who has a drum of some hazardous chemical which may have been left over from some past era and who, because of government or bureaucratic inaction, cannot dispose of it, would put up an ugly sign saying that the chemical was in their shed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be an ongoing education program among the general public on the dangers associated with the transport of potentially dangerous materials by any type of vehicle. The emergence of new materials, the proliferation of carriers involved in the transport of dangerous goods and a general acceptance that existing emergency service procedures will cope with the threat are reasons for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To press my point, I ask: what legislation is there in place to prevent a general carrier loading a mixture of diesel fuel and superphosphate, which is a potential bomb, then during his trip parking in the main street of some town or city outside the picture theatre or local pub? There is no such legislation prohibiting the carriage of such lethal cocktails. Members might ask why the member for Riverina is raising this in the federal parliament as these are state issues. I understand that the federal minister is meeting with state ministers on the question of transport very shortly. I raise these issues so that some standardisation may be arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of consternation has been expressed in Wagga Wagga and district about the closure of the Department of Agriculture veterinary laboratory in that city. Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, I know that you were concerned to get the CSIRO laboratories into Wagga Wagga&mdash;so you know that city well&mdash;in an effort to provide some decentralisation. Unfortunately, you were not successful but you certainly did a good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the closure of the laboratory may be a state government issue, I believe that because of its importance to the Riverina region it should be mentioned in this forum. The closure of the laboratory will result in the loss of 12 permanent and 13 contract jobs in the region. Most importantly of all, we will lose the services of an important organisation in one of the most productive livestock areas in Australia. The laboratory in Armidale is also going. Both are being superseded by the laboratry at Camden near Sydney. The two laboratories to remain open are at Wollongbar near Lismore and Orange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I wish these two laboratories well, it seems strange to me that they are both in marginally held federal Labor electorates with a pending federal election in sight. The figures being used as an excuse for closing the Wagga Wagga laboratory are at best rubbery and at worst totally misleading. The New South Wales government has actually shown a commercial earning of the laboratory of $270,000 as an expense against the organisation, but this is only part of the misconception being perpetrated by the government. It is to be hoped that even at this late stage the minister in New South Wales will put commonsense before political expediency and allow the Wagga Wagga laboratory to remain open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to a very important matter which concerns those people who suffer from mental illness. The Richardson inquiry of the 1980s decided to take the care&mdash;for these people&mdash;out of dedicated institutions for these people and to make homes and houses in the community available so they could mix with the general community and have a useful life and a high quality of life. This was done following similar actions in the United States and Britain. In doing this, government thought that, apart from providing a better quality of life for these people, they would also save a great deal of money. The unfortunate thing is that the money that is being saved has not been spent on those who suffer from mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members might recall that earlier this year Brian Burdekin was less than flattering of a number of governments in his report on the care of the mentally ill in this nation. It so happens that earlier this week the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) raised the question of the lack of health professionals in rural areas. I added my thoughts on the matter and spoke of the shortage of health professionals in the Riverina. I particularly touched on the lack of psychiatrists and those people carrying out psychiatric care in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same day, in answer to a dorothy dixer from the member for Calare (Mr Simmons), the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) confirmed that under the national health care strategy there were to be set up positions in a number of specialties: opthalmology, surgery, internal medicine, radiation and oncology and that they would be established in Townsville, Cairns, Kalgoorlie, Bunbury, Swan Hill, Wagga Wagga and Alice Springs. I particularly welcome the establishment of those positions in Wagga Wagga. I believe the Charles Sturt University is going to play a major role there. This is to try to do something about affording a greater number of health care specialists in rural areas. The answer goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, there are psychiatric training posts to be established in Broken Hill, Alice Springs and Mount Isa.</PARA>
<PARA>We know there has been poor access to psychiatric services. Part of the mental health strategy is to improve on that, and I certainly welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Riverina&mdash;and, I should imagine, in most rural areas in Australia&mdash;have a serious shortage of psychiatrists and those people caring for the mentally ill. We all know that there is an increase in mental illness in our community, unfortunately. It is caused, I suppose, by the strains of modern living. Unfortunately, a lot of that mental illness is among the young people of our nation. It is interesting to note that the specialists say that at least one in 100 people in Australia can expect at one time in their lives to suffer a schizophrenic episode. Some papers have been written associating the use of marijuana with schizophrenia. While I do not think anything has been proved, there is very strong evidence to that effect. Those people who support the legalisation on marijuana ought to think very seriously about that. Anyone who knows people who suffer from schizophrenia or who has family members in that situation would know just how serious that illness is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lack of services in the Riverina. In the Riverina, if you wanted to obtain the specialist services of a psychiatrist&mdash;say you were living in Wagga Wagga, with a population of 55,000&mdash;there is not one resident psychiatrist there. You would have to go to Albury in the south, or perhaps to Goulburn, which is further away, to Canberra or even to Adelaide in the west. For those people who might suffer a psychiatric disturbance it would be almost impossible in some situations to travel. So, firstly they could not travel and, secondly, they would find it very difficult to obtain an interview with a psychiatrist in time to overcome that occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I welcome the formation of a committee in the Riverina. It is a committee of the Riverina Mental Health Community Consultative Committee. I understand that a number of these committees have been set up in New South Wales. I understand that there are 22 regions. They have been set up by the state government. On those committees they have about eight carers and clients. Those people are very well aware of the problems in the area of mental health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an agreement between the federal and state ministers over the setting up of these consultative committees. They are done in consultation with the community. These committees liaise with the police and the ambulance service. That is very important. We have seen all too often in the past someone who has a mental illness come into conflict with the police department. It is not the police department's fault. It is certainly not the fault of those people suffering from mental illness. It probably is the fault of the community. We do not understand mental illness and we are not doing enough about it. The ambulance is very important. Also we must do something for those people suffering from mental illness who perhaps cannot stay at home for different reasons. We must do something about their housing and make sure that they are cared for in the area of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of untreated cases in the community. They simply cannot get in to see someone who may recognise their illness. Their partners or people in the community, because they are not trained, do not recognise their illness. That is part of the community awareness program, if you like, that will assist those people. Some of the problems that are handled by the community consultative committee are perhaps local problems. They may be regional problems. Then again, they may be national problems. I understand that all of these community consultative committees will have an input and maybe in the course of time will put forward strategies that will assist us to care for the mentally ill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I would like to raise is the serious hailstorm that went through the electorate of Riverina just recently. We all know that farmers have a major problem in first of all trying to overcome the elements, then making sure they have a market and then overcoming the problems that are put to them by governments in the way of taxation, lack of incentive, problems on the waterfront and so on. But we cannot blame the government for the weather, although I have been to different functions where it has been said that the weather is the responsibility of the federal member and that I should do something about it. I do not accept that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the night of 4 November this year, a hailstorm of great intensity passed through a strip west of Leeton in the Wamoon-Stanbridge area and caused tremendous damage to citrus orchards, vineyards and other crops in the area. A day or so later I visited the area and I was astounded particularly at the damage caused to citrus trees and grapevines. While inspecting the vines and trees I could not find one piece of fruit that was not damaged. The preliminary count indicated that at least 30 or 40 farmers have been affected to varying degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that district horticulturalist Harry Creecy said that while some parts have been unaffected by hail at Wamoon he has seen cases where 95 to 99 per cent of wine grape plantings have been stripped. Some of them hardly had any leaves. At this time of the year there is little chance of replanting and it could mean a complete loss for this year. Others have had a 50 per cent loss. He said that with high price crops like chardonnay it would still be well worth harvesting what is left. Citrus has also been affected. Valencia fruit has been bruised and young fruitlets for following crops have been damaged. It is unlikely that any will remain on the tree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this year's crop was expected to be larger than last year's, it is hard to estimate the value of the damage. Mr Creecy said some of the nurseries have also been knocked around, the stems of plants being badly bruised. Some of the vegetable plantings have been badly affected, grass has been stripped and cut in two near to the ground. It was amazing to see. Cabbage and lettuce plantations have been destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see&mdash;following recommendations from grower organisations, from the local member for Murrumbidgee, Adrian Cruickshank, and from me&mdash;that Richard Amery, the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales, has declared the area a natural disaster area. He has provided financial loans of up to $80,000 at low interest to help them get through their next crop. But, unfortunately, when I looked at the citrus trees I saw that the next crop and also next year's crop have been damaged. It may be that the federal government will have to provide some household support to enable these people to have food on their tables. Although the damage was described, you could not really believe the damage that hailstones could do until you went and looked at the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to talk on the wine industry. I am very pleased&mdash;and I do not often congratulate the government; but I will on this occasion&mdash;that the federal government did not impose the tax on wine that it had proposed. Unfortunately, in its move to remove one tax but still gain revenue, it has put a tax on certain areas of the wine industry, a tax I am totally opposed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a letter from a winemaker in my area who is very concerned that, while he generally applauded the government's response in relation to taxation, he was extremely concerned that, due to a recent reclassification, two traditional wine products, a vermouth and a marsala would appear to be subject to the new excise in the designer drinks category. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AH4">Mr HICKS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is ridiculous. This is due to the fact that, whilst these products have been regarded for hundreds of years as traditional wine products, they were recently removed from the Australian P4 standard into a new P6 classification. This winery is Australia's largest vermouth producer; the company has been producing vermouth in Australia for over 60 years under its Cinzano trademark. The company requests, on several grounds, that marsala and vermouth be given an exemption from the new excise. The first is that vermouth is made from grape wine fortified with grape wine spirit according to a traditional recipe thought to be over 200 years old&mdash;so it is a wine. Second, vermouth is essentially a fortified wine product which is directly substitutable by port, sherry and other products subject to the P4 classification. It was removed from the P4 only because of the addition of herbal essences and at the insistence of the Europeans in recent negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the vermouth market is already in serious decline, and has been for many years. The quantity of domestically produced vermouth has fallen from approximately two million litres in 1988 to 1.1 million litres for the last 12 months. Those figures come from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Unlike the spirits category, this has not been due to a switch to imports, which are estimated to be less than 10 per cent of the total market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, the vermouth drinker is neither young nor affluent, if that is what the government is concerned about. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AH4">Mr HICKS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not yuppies, as the member says. Like port and sherry, vermouth has an ageing drinker profile. It is purchased by consumers unable to afford highly priced exotic drinks. If applied, this excise will essentially hit the aged and low income sector. It will be seen as a tax on the country's senior citizens. Fifth, in the creation of the P6 category, the traditional nature of vermouth and marsala was recognised, as these products were excluded from the requirement to be labelled as wine product and allowed to continue to be identified as purely vermouth and marsala.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixth, there are three primary producers of vermouth in Australia. These are in the area that I represent in the Riverina, and in South Australia. Vermouth is produced by a substantial number of Australia's 750 licensed wineries, as it is a traditional method of using low quality wines which would otherwise be sent for distillation. Many of these products are sold at the cellar door, and there would therefore be considerable customs and administration problems involved in both regulating production and bonding all these production units involved throughout Australia. It is likely that the administration costs would far outweigh any excise gained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventh, there would not be any likely benefit to consolidated revenue, as it is believed that the bulk of vermouth drinkers will be forced to find substitute products, most likely from the untaxed P4 fortified wines. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I do so because, since last May when our 1995-96 budget was released, our federal Labor government has guided our nation through one of its most important and critical periods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may perhaps seem strange for some to hear me call these last few months important or momentous. There have been little or no headlines attesting to this fact. There has been no terrific fanfare or war declared. I am not even referring to the often tawdry political stories that from time to time tend to grip our nation's media like some ill-gotten case of lockjaw. From my view, as a sitting member in this House for over five years, the previous few months have been a crucial time because this government has been setting its course for the future of our nation. That is what these appropriation bills in no small way are all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since May, this government has been involved in the process of good government not just for Australians today but also for Australians tomorrow. Unlike previous governments, we have not been afraid to make the tough decisions or to put up our hands to show where we think this country should be heading in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Labor Party, while in government since 1983, has never been guilty of procrastination or, as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) put it so colourfully recently, hiding under the lino with our toes in our ears, which is a character trait our predecessors in government showed an amazing capacity for. Sound and good government is always a critical task that is not to be taken lightly. It is certainly not something to be run off course by harping critics harbouring their own special interests and not those of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation bills are a routine activity of this parliament. However, to me, routine suggests apathy and indifference. Good government should never be considered as such. Just as any explorer worth their salt carefully considers every aspect of their luggage and provisions before embarking on a journey, the federal government did the same when it brought down a responsible and stable budget in May. It attended to what Australia needed for the upcoming year. Our government is now seeking to access the finances it needs to operate its budget programs. It gives us a unique moment to reflect on the government's plans and where the money from these appropriation bills will be channelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further still, it allows me to bring to the attention of the House the continually flowing benefits of this government's sound management. Since May we have seen many of the fruits of good government. During my time today I would like to highlight some of those successes and relate them to my own electorate of Prospect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a matter of a few days, when the figures are released for the three months to September, we will see that there have been 17 straight quarters of economic growth. So far we have had 16 straight quarters, the longest period of unbroken economic growth since the early 197Os. I sincerely believe that when the new figures are released it will spell the longest period of growth this country has ever recorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the opposition does not like us to talk about this fact. It just likes us to shut up about the good news. It would say, `Stop crowing. Stop going on about it.' At times the opposition is really like Superman with a rock of kryptonite in his hand, crushed by the news it cannot bear to hear. It is a pity the opposition cannot appreciate the fact that it is good news for all Australians, including its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had 4 1/4 years of solid economic growth. Forgive me for being immodest but I think that is something to talk about, something to shout about from the rooftops of this House. So much in this country depends on this strong growth&mdash;it creates jobs and encourages investment. We have done it while keeping inflation relatively low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the results of good government: six per cent increase in real wages, 10 per cent increase in real household disposable incomes and 12 per cent increase in productivity. Could we have achieved these impressive figures for the rest of Australia if we had been a reckless, insensitive government? No, of course not. It did not work for the coalition up to 1983 and it would not have worked for us if we had followed the coalition's lead. But what of the future? Where will the money for appropriation bills Nos 2, 3 and 4 be heading?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn first to the government's plans for reducing unemployment. In his budget speech delivered in May, our Treasurer (Mr Willis) called reducing unemployment `the government's highest priority'. This has not changed and will not change until our target of five per cent unemployment is reached by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make sure we get there our government has put all its weight behind its far-reaching and comprehensive job finding program, Working Nation. The first year successes of Working Nation have already been well broadcast&mdash;some 380,000 new jobs in the last year, a dramatic reduction in all sectors of the unemployed. In my electorate of Prospect it has been no different. The federal government's job program has been putting people back to work at an amazing rate of knots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just last week I attended a ceremony where recent graduates from a new work opportunities program were receiving their certificates. This is after the ceremony which was scheduled for the previous month had been cancelled because nearly every one of those graduates, having completed that 26-week training program, had found employment and were not able to take time off to receive those certificates. So with great gratification they were mailed to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At last week's ceremony the news was also extremely encouraging, and I was able to view some of the amazing work the people had been focusing on. Half of the graduates at that particular ceremony had been part of one of our most innovative job training projects: an Asian vegetable market garden. It is a unique attempt to help people from ethnic backgrounds gain employment. It has already received the attention of the national television media and the major metropolitan newspapers. In fact, I will go so far as to say that, even though at the moment we are importing many exotic vegetables, after a few more years we will have an export market because the people will be able to put their skills and job training to good use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the government's groundbreaking approach to job training, and with those local people putting the Working Nation program into action displaying great sensitivity towards people's needs, interests and aspirations, we have been extremely successful in bringing unemployment down in an area of Sydney hard hit by joblessness. In fact, over the last year there has been an 11.7 per cent drop in the number of unemployed within my Prospect electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money from the appropriation bills will go to programs such as these all across Australia&mdash;programs that in conjunction with our steadily growing economy are putting thousands of Australians back to work. They are programs such as the training pays project, which aims to produce 3,000 more jobs in south western Sydney by Christmas. By offering federal government subsidies of sometimes more than $10,000 to the wages of individual employees, we hope to encourage employers to give people, often young people straight from school or tertiary study, their first break, their first golden opportunity to join the work force. Jobs may be the government's highest priority, but they are not the only one. Where else will the money be going?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to look at health, but where do you begin when you are faced with a government prepared to spend over $19 billion on health and human services between 1995 and 1996? The appropriation bills will help continue this government's commitment to medical services made in the budget to the tune of some $6 billion and to providing some $4.5 billion to the states to run public hospitals&mdash;not to mention the $1.5 billion that has been earmarked to give the states over the next five years the opportunity to upgrade the public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government believes in protecting the health of everyone in Australia. We are quite happy to invest billions of dollars into a universal health care scheme and into the healthy lives of all Australians, even though it has been described in the past by the opposition as an `unmitigated disaster' and a `human nightmare'. Who made these comments? We certainly did not and neither did the people to whom we are providing Medicare facilities. It was the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), this man who would like all Australians to believe that he now supports Medicare, who made those comments. The same person who states he now supports it will want to cut and slash Medicare and the government's commitment to health care if ever he becomes Prime Minister. I am sure most of us will remember the two million Australians who had no health insurance whatsoever in 1983. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;I am pleased that he has come into the House&mdash;we are not the only ones who remember; a lot of the people whom we represent also remember that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prospect electorate and Sydney's south-west as a whole stand to benefit substantially from the passing of these appropriation bills. In an area that used to wonder what it was missing in relation to health care, the entire community has recently become the grateful recipient of perhaps the world's most advanced children's hospital, which is now situated at Westmead. With no small support from the federal government via its contributions to the New South Wales government in accordance with that Medicare agreement, Westmead stands as a beacon to all Australians. It is an example of the extremely high level of public health care that we are capable of providing and are all able to appreciate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Leader of the Opposition cries `unfair' whenever we talk about his previous policies. He says that we are indulging in character assassination. I cannot understand how he could use the word `assassination' in that context. Correct me if I am wrong, but we are merely restating the member for Bennelong's own words. He is the one who called Medicare a `disaster'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prospect electorate and south-western Sydney as a whole now enjoy a level of health care equal to anywhere else in Australia. The federal government's national child immunisation program, a $24 million allocation over the next two years; the national cervical screening program, a $42 million allocation over the next four years; the mobile breast screening units that we already have up and running; and other things that never existed before in the western Sydney region are now part of what we take for granted. All these programs mean something to all Australians. They mean something particularly to the people in my electorate and they are already starting to have a tremendous effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good government, responsible government, also means attending to the needs of our families. The government stands tall in this respect with its remarkable track record on the social safety net. Australians are justifiably proud of their sporting heroes and their achievements. In the same respect, I believe we should also be proud that in this country we have one of the most advanced and wide covering social safety net programs in the world. When others talk about social justice, we have not only through these appropriation bills but also through the budget implemented a system that has been described worldwide as second to none. The people that have been provided with the care, the confidence and most importantly the financial security because of the stable schemes that we have put into place are the people who will remember what we have been able to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas I am a bit concerned about in my own electorate in relation to the opening of the Westmead Hospital, of which I am so proud, is that the state government could consider closing the 24-bed children's ward in the Fairfield Hospital. I urge the state government to give full consideration to this matter. I know they are investigating the areas, but I urge them to make sure that when we open new facilities we do not do it by sacrificing what is already in existence. We need specialist care and we need these facilities, but we do not need to have them at the expense of a facility that already exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the appropriation bills to the House. I congratulate the Treasurer for the budget he brought down. I know that the people of Australia, the voters who will be voting us back into government at the next election, commend us too for the action that has been taken in regard to these appropriations bills before the House. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the principle, we direct the parties to confer with a view to resolving the dispute currently before us, taking into account the following: the system of collective bargaining as an essential part of the industrial relations system, fostered and encouraged by the Industrial Relations Reform Act, underpinned by international conventions and standards which Australia has ratified. Members of unions should not be discriminated against on the basis of their preferred form of bargaining.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. There are indeed a number of economic commentators in Australia who say very little else, apart from calling for faster fiscal consolidation and faster micro-economic reform. Among them are the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, occasionally, the Leader of the Opposition. I saw the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on Sunday trying to cut the mustard on precisely that point. He entered that particular foray on Sunday, having behind him a statement that they regarded the government's fiscal consolidation as too slow and that whatever cuts the government had put in place they would better them. On top of that, having given that undertaking, he also let float out there as one of the opposition policies a $2.5 billion slug on the revenue side for tax deductibility treatment on interest on savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then managed to tell the media at that show he appeared on that he believed the budget was out $3 billion to $5 billion. He was then invited, having made such dramatic statements and having gone through the process of putting up so many options to further deplete the Commonwealth's revenue, to say precisely what he would do on that $3 billion to $5 billion. His only answer was, `Oh, well, I might have said that, but the government said something different, so we do not have anything in mind.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> He was then pressed further three or four times and he could not think of one thing to say in the area of fiscal policy except this, `We want to have a responsible fiscal policy.' That is all he had to say: `We want to have one. The desire is out there. We want it. That is our desire. But, of course, the capacity to deliver it does not, in contemporary terms, reside in our hearts.' When you look at the opposition's treatment&mdash;of which the instance that the questioner referred to is merely one example&mdash;of the government's budget over the last few months, you can see exactly where they are coming from. Look at their response: they have opposed measures worth a total of $11.4 billion over four years; they have actually blocked in the Senate measures worth a total of $3.4 billion over four years; and they are still threatening to block in the Senate measures worth a further $1 billion over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an opposition that talk a storm on the question of fiscal consolidation, that rock on into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> shows and that toss over the top of their shoulders $3 billion to $5 billion worth of what they regard as inadequacy in the government's fiscal performance. But when they are invited to make a statement as to how they would deal with that particular problem what they come up with is absolutely nothing. They have opposed $11.4 billion, blocked $3.4 billion and are threatening $1 billion. They have got a week to deliver another $1 billion hole, having delivered a $3.4 billion hole, in the fiscal position of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those happens to be the airport proposal that was referred to by the honourable member in his question&mdash;some $2 billion. The processes of going through a sale as complex as the sale of those licences&mdash;indeed, as complex as many of the privatisations that the government has been involved in over the last few years&mdash;is a most intricate, intense and time consuming one. If you start putting delays in the processes, you knock months out of it. You can, in fact, knock years out of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still do not have any undertaking, irrespective of what the outcome of the election might be, that if we are re-elected but do not have a Senate majority we will get the propositions through then in those circumstances. According to the Leader of the Opposition, he will still be in there with his proposal, with his demand on the government that they open a 24-hour east-west runway operation at Sydney airport. The opposition will hold up $2 billion worth of fiscal consolidation to open an unsafe 24-hour operation on the east-west runway in Sydney. That is a positively moronic proposition as far as the opposition is concerned. So they pour that stupidity and that expediency on top of their utter irresponsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could almost say in looking at that $2 billion that, if that is all there was, I suppose you could live with it and see what else could be shaken out of the tree on the way through.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the commission not just for its assertion of the primacy of collective bargaining but also for its landmark statement on the protection of workers from discrimination by employers offering individual contracts. That was at the very heart of this dispute. As I said yesterday when we saw the result, it was a very good one for our system of dispute resolution and it was a very good one for our system of collective bargaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, if one looks at the cause of the dispute and its resolution, it is the opposition's industrial relations policies that caused everyone very great alarm. It is clear that the terms of the opposition's policies are a recipe&mdash;as I said earlier today&mdash;for CRA-type disputes the length and breadth of Australia and, indeed, disputes without any means of resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the commission asserted the government's system was overwhelmingly in favour of collective bargaining. Yet it is the opposition's intention to give primacy to the individual contract, to put the individual contract beyond the scope of the commission. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition has said so repeatedly. He turns his back now, but it is worth remembering his quotes. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this nation needs is an industrial relations system that elevates the direct contract between the employer and the employee above all other industrial arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>So forget collective bargaining having primacy, being the primary consideration. Under those sitting opposite, individual contracts would have primacy. In other words, the CRA approach&mdash;the approach that is the exception today&mdash;would be the norm under the coalition. Added to that is the fact that there would be no compulsory award underpinning under the contracts that would be available John Howard style. In that situation Australia could look forward to a great deal of industrial response which would make the CRA dispute and its resolution mild by comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these disputes occurred, how would the opposition deal with them? One thing is for sure: they couldn't turn to the commission because they have said it is their intention to gut it as soon as they get into office. Indeed, in relation to the commission, John Howard said in the House in the plainest of terms on 24 June 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we will stab them in the stomach.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were his words&mdash;wonderful words&mdash;about the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In less colloquial terms, earlier on in 1992 he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we quite openly want to reduce the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. . . . We will ask the Parliament of this country to reduce the role of the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have the policy of the opposition. In the wake of the CRA dispute, Australia is faced with an opposition which, if ever it were elected, would not only propose more of the cause&mdash;that is, contracts&mdash;but also less of the solution; that is, an effective and powerful industrial relations commission. If you want final confirmation of this point, the best thing to do is to recall the words of John Howard on 24 April 1992. He took part in this terrific exchange on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Journalist: So, Mr Howard, you could have a picture where on the production line or behind a counter you would have two workers&mdash;one with award conditions and another with a contract&mdash;and there'd be great variations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard: That's right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Journalist: Great variations in pay and conditions. Two identical workers doing the same job. In other words, a situation that led us to Weipa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard: That's absolutely right.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course that is right. As we have said all along, CRA and the dispute we have witnessed in the last few days would be just a small taste of what life would be like under the coalition. The opposition leader has confirmed it again and again. He has confirmed it not just in the House but on every radio program across the nation. It is clear for all to see.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very positive thing about this dispute is its demonstration value of just what life would be like for all Australians if ever there were a change of government, because it would be contracts writ large, it would be a destroyed commission without the powers to resolve a dispute&mdash;the powers that have been so well used by Deidre O'Connor and the commission this week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government condemns unreservedly France's defiance of the manifest wishes of the international community in proceeding to conduct a fourth nuclear test in the South Pacific. It is an act which will rightly earn the French government the condemnation not only of Australia but of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has restated in forceful terms our demand for an immediate and permanent end to nuclear testing by France in the South Pacific. This morning Senator Evans called in the French ambassador to deliver our strong protest, which will also be put directly to the French government by our ambassador in Paris. Through the ambassador, Senator Evans called again on France to abandon now any plans for further nuclear tests in the Pacific, commit itself to close once and for all the nuclear test facilities at Mururoa, provide to the international community full and unrestricted access to all the scientific data it holds and to the test sites to enable an independent and comprehensive environmental assessment to take place, and to accept full and exclusive responsibility for any adverse impacts from the tests on the South Pacific environment and on their people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This latest nuclear test will serve only to entrench regional and international opposition to France's nuclear testing program and, as the Prime Minister has said, will contribute further to the devaluation of France's international credentials. I might add that the test places in stark relief the direct call which was made only last week by the United Nations, including 10 of France's 14 colleagues in the European Union, for an immediate end to all nuclear testing. It is particularly disappointing that France has again ignored the express commitment of the countries of the South Pacific to a region free of nuclear weapons and in so doing has further compounded the damage to its standing in that region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a united front with our partners in the region we have argued that the resumption of nuclear testing by France carries with it unacceptable long-term environmental risks for the fragile maritime environment of the South Pacific. We have repeatedly expressed our strong concern at the effects of the resumption of nuclear tests by France on the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the potential damage that may do to the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty. We have continued to press France to stop its testing program through a comprehensive strategy of actions at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. In so doing we have worked very hard with the countries of the South Pacific to that end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that Australia has played a leading role in this because of statements that have been made by France. As the Prime Minister recently affirmed when he spoke on 24 October here in support of his disarmament initiative, we are determined now to harness the understandable anger of people all over the world at continuing nuclear testing to a longer term and a bolder aim, that is to say a world completely free of nuclear weapons. We believe that international pressure, in which Australia has been a leading force, is having an effect in France itself, reflected time and time again in comments from the highest level in France, which puts Australia squarely at the front of international opposition to nuclear testing. It is also reflected&mdash;and this is a pleasing development&mdash;in recent indications from the French government that France has decided to reduce the number and the duration of tests in this current series.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another pleasing development, France has agreed to support a truly comprehensive zero yield test ban, and for signature to this to be in 1996. Perhaps most significantly for this part of the world it has agreed, in company with the United States and the United Kingdom, to sign the relevant protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. That is a goal for which Australia has worked long and hard over a period of years. I conclude by saying that, while we welcome these significant developments, it goes without saying that they in no way weaken Australia's resolve to see an immediate end to all nuclear testing in all environments. We will continue vigorously to press France for an immediate end to all nuclear testing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, the Commonwealth has been looking seriously at options in this area because we do acknowledge that the level of youth unemployment is far too high. Progress has been made but we need to go a lot further. He might be aware that over the last month we have had significant consultations with the young people of this country in terms of getting an understanding as to which programs they see working to their advantage and where they can be improved upon. We have also significantly changed the subsidy arrangements for jobstart to take out a differential rate for youth so that now there is significantly more incentive for employers to take on young people, employ them and train them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have significantly opened up the area of traineeships so that young people can now seek traineeships in areas that they want to pursue, such as the environment, sport, the arts, the media and publications. Before Working Nation was on the scene, no traineeships existed in these areas, despite the fact that there has been significant job growth in those areas plus a number of others. The House would also be aware of the important initiatives we have made in guaranteeing jobs from schools through a pathway linkage between vocational subjects in schools and job opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to believe that these are important changes. But we will go further. I believe that we have an obligation to the young people of this country to provide them with opportunities in rewarding careers, allowing them to pursue the interests that they want to pursue and enabling them to do it with a degree of dignity. That is why, following the consultations that I have alluded to, we will be going further with the initiatives. I will be releasing later this week the results of the consultations that we have had.

In other words, she blames the victim and does not come up with any constructive solutions to recognise why so many young people are out of the work force.

Our young people deserve better, and under this government they will get it. Anyone who wants to join us in a constructive program will be most welcome.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition's suggestion is based on an article which made those suggestions and appeared today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. The article is completely and utterly inaccurate. The claims made are inaccurate because Mr Ruthven, who wrote the article, appears not to have read the explanatory notes that the Bureau of Statistics includes in its publication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article claims that the poorest 40 per cent of households are worse off in real terms than in 1984. In fact, the ABS points out that it changed the definition of `income' in the expenditure surveys between these points in time. In 1984 business incomes were set at zero where self-employed persons were reporting a business loss. In the 1993-94 survey, actual reported losses were included in the survey. This change in definition produces the apparent falls in income that the article highlights. It is no more than a statistical artefact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the article gives great emphasis to the finding that for many groups average expenditure exceeds average income and goes on to conclude that lower income households are going backwards while only the richest 20 per cent are saving. In fact, the ABS bulletin specifically states and emphasises household income and expenditure estimates therefore do not balance for individual households or for groups of households and the difference between income and expenditure cannot be considered to be a measure of saving. The ABS says that the analysts should not do what the article does. The conclusions drawn in the article are wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the article discusses incomes before income tax. The ABS has estimated that the share of incomes after tax held by the richest 20 per cent fell between the late 1980s and 1993-94. The article notes that there are differences in average household size over time but then does not take account of it. The highest income group has twice as many people per household as the lowest income group, many of whom are single pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often argued that household spending is a better measure of living standards since it takes account of the effect of income taxes as well as the extent to which people are accumulating savings or drawing down their savings when they retire. This corresponds more with the idea of permanent income. On this basis, inequality of living standards is much less than inequality of gross incomes. The highest income group is spending only 3.26 times as much as the lowest income group, per person the difference is only 1.6 times as much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure appears to have become more equal since 1988-89 under the analysis of the Bureau of Statistics when the previous expenditure survey was conducted. In 1988-89 total expenditure by the highest income group was 3.6 times that of the lowest group, not 3.26. The difference per person was 1.7 times, not 1.6 times. So the statistics that are the basis of this article are totally flawed, and that ought to have been obvious both to the person who wrote the article and to the Leader of the Opposition, who based his question on that article.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got every reason to be proud of the fact that real incomes for individuals have increased by about 20 per cent and for households by 40 per cent since we have been in office. In terms of support for households and particularly in terms of support for families, there has been an increase in various family payments ranging in real terms from between 75 and 130 per cent. That contrasts with real reductions of some 17 per cent in support for households and support for families when the opposition leader happened to have the Treasury bench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a bit keen to ask a question on the subject of recycling a few questions ago. I suppose the greatest example of recycling in this House is the opposition's bringing back in this election context as leader and would-be alternative Prime Minister the chap who delivered those sorts of statistics&mdash;I referred to them earlier&mdash;some 13 years ago now, and to replace what? The dream team. We remember that great dream team, don't we? Another great opportunity for the member for Mayo and the deputy leader. They stood up there&mdash;all jeans and prams.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition claimed in one of his many wasteland speeches, one of these emanations from the policy free zone:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1976 and 1992, the number of households in Australia earning between $22,000 and $72,000 a year declined from 65 to 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>He thundered that this represents `a largely classless society facing the prospect of the collapse of its great equalising middle Australia'. These are the assertions from the Leader of the Opposition. They have been repeated by other opposition spokesmen and, of course, they have been repeated by the Leader of the Opposition himself. They are one of his recurring themes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the statement is demonstrably false. At the 1991 census, around 63 per cent of families were in this income range&mdash;a lot more than the 40 per cent quoted by the Leader of the Opposition. So his collapsing middle Australia is a myth. That is the first point to make. The statistics he has quoted are just completely false, as shown by the 1991 census.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Prime Minister just referred to the article by Mr Phil Ruthven in today's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. There are a great many misleading points in the article by Mr Ruthven, as the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out. One thing he did get right was to accurately quote the results of the ABS household expenditure data that shows there has been little change in the share of income going to the middle income group. Again, this completely contradicts the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ruthven did, of course, make a number of inaccurate statements. He made the claim that household income has fallen by two per cent in real terms over the last decade and that inequality has increased. Both of these claims are false. In fact, average household size, as he indicated, has also fallen by eight per cent. So the supposed two per cent fall in real incomes per household represents a six per cent increase in real household incomes per person. That is the first point that needs to be made. That is household incomes. That is not disposable income. When you take into account tax and social wage changes, the picture becomes considerably more favourable again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ruthven obviously did not read the explanatory notes about the supposed fall in real income amongst the lowest income groups. The fact is that there is a definitional change, and the ABS explicitly warned against using the statistics contained in that survey in the way Mr Ruthven did&mdash;both in terms of the definitional changes and the applicability of comparing income and expenditure figures. It is just inaccurate and the ABS was absolutely explicit in warning against that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not paint the full picture. I have mentioned on a number of occasions this government's record in improving the social wage, which overwhelmingly benefits people on lower incomes. Ann Harding, at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, has pointed out that when you add in just the four components of the social wage&mdash;those of housing, education, health and child care&mdash;the non-cash benefits provided to people, the differential between the top 20 per cent and the bottom 20 per cent contracts from 13 to one, to four to one. That is the impact of the social wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An average couple with two children derives benefits which, if you were paying for them, would be worth around $200 per week. That benefit goes, as I said, overwhelmingly to the low income groups. I also point out that a recent OECD survey, released a couple of weeks ago, pointed out that we have one of the most effectively progressive tax and transfer payment systems in the world. This is a bit of a contrast with the picture they seek to portray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the developed world there have been pressures driving differentials in market based incomes apart. Those effects have been much less pronounced in this country than in other countries, like the UK and the United States, which tend to follow opposition policy prescriptions. It is the case that the policy actions taken by this government have consistently acted to mitigate, minimise and diminish inequality and provide a far better safety net for those on low incomes.</PARA>

Because they have done an enormous backflip. Do you know what happens to an acrobat when they do a backflip? They end up facing the same direction when they hit the ground.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask: is it any wonder that the small businesses around Australia are so cynical about Labor's commitment to, and concern for, small businesses when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in all his arrogance&mdash;at the height of arrogance&mdash;declared to small business, `This is as good as it gets. What are you complaining about? If you can't make it in this climate, go out and get yourselves a PAYE job'? Is it any wonder that we see this kind of cynicism from small business when Senator Gareth Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, last week said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best possible thing this government could do for small business is to create an economic environment in which small business can flourish&mdash;a climate of sustained growth, which we are managing to do with 3 3/4 of a per cent growth this year; a low inflation environment; an interest rate environment that is extremely modest by any previous comparison . . . and activity because business is profitable at the moment. Business confidence is high at the moment and consumer confidence is high.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure where the senator has been, but it certainly is not out there doorknocking the businesses of Australia. Is it any wonder that you have this cynicism when the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, says&mdash;and he has been saying it for months&mdash;that he supports the Prime Minister's comments that I have just quoted and that small businesses are doing fine under Labor. Is it any wonder that the message from small business is that the Labor Party, the government and the minister are totally out of touch with what is going on in small business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of months ago we sat here and we listened to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) tell us that small business was not worried any more about the industrial relations reforms, particularly in relation to the dismissal regulations, because they were learning to live with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is absolutely out of touch. In that very week that he sits on this bench and makes that statement, there was a report out of Queensland from the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They surveyed all their members in Queensland, and the result was that the dismissal provision was the No. 1 issue of concern for small business. It was paralysing their decisions to take on new employees. So it is no wonder that business is cynical and that the business response to this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small business index: </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">a special report on small business proprietors' attitude to government</EMPHASIS> says what it says. It is a damning indictment on this government. They simply do not understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one consistent factor with this message being sent by the Labor government, as shown in all of these statements by these Labor ministers on our front bench&mdash;these are the people who are governing this country and who are supposedly making the policies; one could ask, `What policies?'&mdash;it is that it is out of touch. This government has no connection with the realities that are occurring out there within the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, when the minister for small business recently said&mdash;at a lunch in which we both spoke&mdash;that he had been out talking to small businesses and that he had actually gone out and spoken to several hundred small businesses, somebody sitting next to me made a quip about `Which ones?' because, while he might have been out there, he obviously was not listening. One has to also ask the question whether these minders are setting up appointments for him in successful businesses and perhaps, if he took the time to go out and randomly doorknock, he might actually come up with one or two right answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world that the Prime Minister, Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Schacht have been describing certainly bears no relationship to the real world for small business. Their comments bear no relationship to these facts: that Australia's interest rates are amongst the highest in the major industrialised countries, which impacts directly on small business borrowing costs; that the government's draconian industrial relations legislation is paralysing employment growth, increasing small business uncertainty and reducing employment flexibility and opportunity; and that rising inflation is rekindling small business fears of a re-run of Labor's disastrous boom-bust economic management patterns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a fact that, for many rural and regional small businesses, their recession has never ended. It has continued unabated, and for some the conditions have worsened in rural and regional Australia. Small businesses are still being swamped by regulation and red tape. The fact is that under Labor the pages in the tax act has increased by 286 per cent. Small business proprietors are working harder and longer hours just to keep their heads above water. Business bankruptcies are now at a four-year high, and small businesses still remember, vividly, the 135,000 bankruptcies that emanated from the `recession we had to have'&mdash;I quote the Prime Minister. The fact is that, under Labor, the small businesses, which are the engine room of the economic growth in this country, employing 3 1/2 million Australians&mdash;or 45 per cent of the work force&mdash;and generating nearly one-third of gross domestic product is simply being given no incentive from the Labor government to capitalise on the many opportunities that are present within our economic structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fact is best illustrated by the 1995 budget in which taxes for small business were increased. The burden of tax was lumped onto small business. This government did nothing to cut through the real issues that are impeding the growth and development of small business in our country. For Labor, small business is simply a milch cow to satisfy its thirst for big government and big spending. Small business definitely knows that. That is exactly what has come out in this index in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's rhetoric does not wash with individuals who are daily faced with the difficulties created by Labor's failed policies or Labor's lack of implementation of any policies. The customers and clients of small business are the people who are concerned about their futures. They are the ones who want jobs for their children. They are the ones who want security in their employment. They are the ones whose own dreams and aspirations are being shattered by Labor's failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Yellow Pages report has encapsulated the thoughts of the small business community very succinctly. After 13 years of Labor government, small business has stated that taxation, bureaucracy, paperwork, lack of incentive, lack of understanding, industrial relations and government charges are reasons for their belief that government policies are unsupportive of small business. The report is a damming report card of the performance of the minister and the Keating Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's policies have been overwhelmingly dismissed as negative by 57 per cent of the small business respondents to this survey. There can be no louder message delivered by the small business community to the Labor government than that it feels it has been abandoned and neglected. That feeling is very much encapsulated in this report, which is a very respected document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of the list of issues raised clearly supports this view. These issues have been promoted by representatives of the sector for years. A plethora of reports line the shelves. I would need a wheelbarrow to bring those reports down to this chamber. We have seen the inability of this government to translate this material into actual working policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as small business is concerned, there has been&mdash;and still is&mdash;a policy vacuum in this government. After 13 years of Labor, small business is still being treated by the government as an outpost in the Australian economy; a convenient source of riches to fill the coffers of an increasingly burgeoning government. In return, small business is told by Labor that the provisional tax uplift factor cannot be set at a more realistic level; that capital gains tax reforms cannot be undertaken; and that fringe benefits tax reforms cannot be seriously addressed. In fact, when the government did endeavour to address that issue it undertook a review of the fringe benefits tax and came back and added to the burden of taxation on small business. Small business has also told Labor that it wants something done about industrial relations policies&mdash;particularly the unfair dismissal claims that are clogging the court system. </PARA>

Close to six out of 10 people in small business believe that the government's current economic and other policies work against the interests of small business.

The Yellow Pages report is small business speaking. This voice is not being heard. This is coming from the engine room that drives this economy. These are the people who are not cocooned in a plush ministerial suite. These are the people at the sharp end of Labor's policy vacuum and they do not like the pain that is being inflicted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the last 15 minutes we have been treated to a load of drivel from a shadow minister. This is the first occasion since the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) was appointed as a shadow minister that she has raised the issue of small business in this chamber. There have been five questions on small business to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) since he took over the portfolio. So I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. Small business is an issue which the opposition has demonstrably shown no interest in. It is a subject of vital importance to the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a government, we have always recognised the importance of small business to Australia's economy and society. The statistics are worth noting. Small businesses make up 96 per cent of all firms in Australia, account for 45 per cent of total employment, and increasingly it is small firms that are driving employment growth and innovation in this country. Small firms, for example, created more than 850,000 new jobs between 1985-86 and 1993-94. To say that the government has failed to acknowledge small business is simply false. The Yellow Pages small index business report which the shadow minister referred to is fatally flawed. It was targeted specifically with a political bias. As a consequence, we say on the record that this report has no integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let's deal with the shadow minister and her claims with respect to this report. They are in total conflict with recent business surveys as at 22 November 1995. Let me go through just a few of them. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-Westpac survey of industrial trends shows that the net balance of respondents expecting output to increase in the next quarter rose by 23 percentage points to 70 per cent in the September quarter. Expectations about employment, overtime levels and new orders also rose in the latest survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Manufactures-Telstra survey of Australian manufacturing said that manufacturers are positive about trading conditions in the December quarter with almost half the respondents anticipating increased output in the final quarter of the calendar year. Moreover, firms also expect forward orders and employment capacity utilisation to improve in the December quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures-State Bank survey of manufacturing activity said that the percentage of firms engaged in exporting is currently at its highest level ever. The ABS business expectation survey showed a firming of expectations overthe year ahead. The National Australia Bank quarterly business survey showed that medium-term inflation expectations have deteriorated and a net balance of 28 per cent of firms expect inflation to remain between three and four per cent over the 1990s, down nine percentage points on the result for the June quarter. The survey also indicated that the strong productivity growth of recent years will continue with private sector productivity expected to rise two per cent in 1995-96. The Reuters survey and the Ernst and Young business indicator&mdash;the list goes on&mdash;are positive indicators of the rise of confidence in the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the federal government has three times a year circulated a progress report on the small business reform agenda. It goes out to forum members and is then distributed right around the country. It gives an analysis of small business trends and small business opportunities that are occurring in this country. This again is in stark contrast to and is in conflict with that flawed survey conducted by the Yellow Pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister is a prolific writer of press releases, very few of which get published, and for good reason&mdash;because the content is right over the top. She also has a penchant to talk in hyperbole, in mysterious terms that are frankly misunderstood and cannot be understood by the small business community. She also gets up to a number of stunts on various occasions. For example, in June this year, at a speech at Brassey House, at the small business coalition dinner&mdash;she is in the chamber and I am sure she will remember it&mdash;she said she was glad that Senator Schacht, as minister for small business, had to deal with the issue of unconscionable conduct and she did not. That is the sort of standard we are to expect from a person who aspires to be a minister in a future federal government. She admits that the job of minister would be simply too hard for her. That is on her own admission. I will refer to her recent escapade in Adelaide later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister complained about interest rates, particularly the interest rate on the 90-day bill. The fact of the matter is that the 90-day bank bill rate is a very important key business indicator. Under John Howard, the rate was significantly higher. In fact, through the Bank of New South Wales, I was paying over 23 per cent on a 90-day bill. Currently, the 90-day bill stands at 7.4 per cent. In March 1983, the 90-day bank bill rate, under John Howard&mdash;the official rate, despite what I paid&mdash;was 15.9 per cent. So the current major indicator for short-term business is half the rate that existed under your leader. The absolute bumph that is spoken by the shadow minister needs to be exposed in the general community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's industry policy is strongly focused on the needs of Australian business. I remind honourable members what that policy is all about. The government's industry policy has two key objectives: creating a world competitive business environment, and building on the competitive strengths of our individual enterprises. Over the past decade the government has vastly improved the business environment faced by all Australian firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these reforms have included dismantling the tariff barriers that were constraining the competitiveness of this country's businesses, deregulating the financial markets, floating the dollar, and creating an industrial relations system that is both efficient and fair in contrast to that espoused by the opposition. We well remember the industrial relations policy espoused by the current Leader of the Opposition during the last federal election campaign under their policy document Fightback, which was thoroughly rebuffed by the electorate in March 1993. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that the Australian people will be reminded again and again of the disaster that could befall them, particularly in their job security, if the opposition had its way and implemented its industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Yellow Pages index survey that the shadow minister referred to&mdash;the one that I have stated is fatally flawed&mdash;tells us that tax is one issue close to the small business community's heart. May I remind members that the current company tax rate in this country is 36 per cent, fully 10 percentage points lower than it was in 1983. The reforms instituted by the government have created an environment where all firms can flourish; there is no question about that. Australia has now recorded 15 consecutive quarters of growth. That is almost four consecutive years of continuous growth, in excess of any index or indices used by the OECD countries. Importantly, this growth has been achieved at a time when inflation has been kept in check, the work force is growing rapidly, at more than double the average rate for the Western world since 1983 when your Leader of the Opposition was federal Treasurer, and when household disposable income is rising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures speak for themselves, but they mask an even more fundamental change to Australia's business environment. Australian industry is 50 per cent more competitive than it was in 1983. Exports are growing rapidly. Exports of high value added manufactures have increased by an average of 17.5 per cent a year over the last five years. This is the environment in which Australian small businesses are operating, in contrast to the fatally flawed report you referred to in the chamber here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own portfolio, in regard to Ausindustry's assistance to small business, more than 5,000 firms have been assisted; 4,230 have phoned hotlines since June of this year for assistance; 2,800 firms received NIES assistance this year; and 2,200 firms have received grants or research and development tax concessions. In addition to that, there is BizLink, which is a computer program designed to provide to every small business in Australia, a bank or lawyer's office or accountant's office, information on federal government assistance programs for small business. These are incontrovertible facts. But where is the opposition's policy on small business? Opposition members close their eyes. They know nothing about small business and they have learnt nothing about small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what the shadow minister got up to in Adelaide on 14 November. She made an address to the Australian Small Business Association. It must have been extremely disappointing for ASBA to have had a guest speaker, the opposition spokesperson on small business, and to have received no specific small business policies. I refer to an interview concerning the shadow minister on ABC radio on 14 November 1995. Mr Siekman, who is the President of the Australian Small Business Association, was asked a question. He responded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We certainly would like to see policies that we can study and put forward. The Australian Small Business Association is a dedicatedly apolitical organisation. We want to follow policies, not parties, and therefore we have to have a look at the policies. We're very keen to see what they are.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: How much pressure are you putting on the Coalition to deliver you more detail so that you can have a look at those policies?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Siekman: We have asked all the parties to give us a look at their policies. We haven't got any from the coalition yet. We will probably keep asking and we hope that they'll be revealed soon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question: Are the Coalition taking you for granted, assuming that they've got you on the board anyway?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Siekman: They certainly haven't got us on board&mdash;certainly they shouldn't take us for granted.</PARA>
<PARA>The shadow minister for small business has been parroting it around the country that small business supports the coalition, referring to a flawed Yellow Pages document which has no basis in fact, despite what they claim to be a 1,200 respondent survey about support from small business for the coalition. Small business is awake up to the opposition, awake up to its lack of policies. On 14 November, about a week ago, they identified the shadow minister for small business as a person of vacuum, a person who does not have any policies on this issue, a person who is unable to cobble together policies and, when pressed on a point, pleads that these policies will be released at a time closer to the election. We know very well that she has not got any policies and that she is intellectually incapable of cobbling a credible small business policy together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing the Australian business environment particularly for small business, we have been very conscious as a government of the particular needs of small business. Through the National Small Business Forum and other consultative mechanisms we have communicated directly with Australian small business about their needs. We have been involved in a consultative process. We have released a package for small business. That was done by the minister on 21 September. He will strengthen the Trade Practices Act to improve the standards of business conduct. This is another issue where the shadow minister initially promised support, positive participation, in the policy development process and then was stood on by the shadow Treasurer or others on the front bench and has resiled from supporting this important initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we will establish a small business trade practices unit within the Australian competition consumer commission to provide a focus for small business trade practices issues and also proceed with reform of corporate law to assist small business operators.

This failed government has failed small business. I will come back if I have time to the details of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make the point right now about how business people in the survey said they would vote. It was a survey of 1,200 small businesses. That is a very substantial survey&mdash;not mickey mouse; a fair dinkum survey. How would they vote? Seventy-four per cent of the 1,200 said they would vote for the coalition. How many for the Labor Party? A mere 17 per cent. Why wouldn't they vote that way when this disreputable government has failed small business? It has failed because it does not understand small business, because collectively its members have no experience in small business, because they have never had to make a quid, because they have never had to make a profit and because they have never had to be concerned about the bottom line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are the small business men and women in the government? For example, let's look at the Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul John Keating. If you look at the `Qualifications and occupation before entering federal parliament' section in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook</EMPHASIS>, you will see `Research officer and industrial advocate, Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union of Australia'. Mind you, he does not say that he was sacked from David Jones on 15 July 1957 and that the person who was in charge of him said, `He was an arrogant person and often rude to customers.' Here is one leopard that does not change his spots: he is still arrogant and he is still rude to the punters. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business is suffering because this government does not know and does not care. It does not acknowledge that its own labour policies are failing small business in many areas. This Yellow Pages survey has revealed without any doubt that the areas that small business is concerned about are where this government's policies&mdash;there are no policies; there are actions&mdash;are failing, and that is in taxation. Small business is being treated unfairly compared with big business. The bureaucracy and the paperwork is killing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of incentive, the lack of understanding of small business, the industrial relations policies of this present government and&mdash;have no doubt&mdash;the unfair dismissal program of this present government are inhibiting small businesses from taking people on. They are too scared&mdash;and with good reason. Everyone in this parliament has heard the stories of people who have been fired because they did not turn up for work, they were rude to the customers or they even had their hand in the till&mdash;they go for an unfair dismissal ruling&mdash;and the poor business has to put them back on or pay them something. It is totally unfair. Government charges are also totally unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key national issues facing the next federal government have been identified by the 1,200 small businesses surveyed by the Yellow Pages. There are three issues: unemployment, the economy and economic strategy, and foreign debt. The reality is that Labor has failed when it comes to unemployment. There is no doubt about that. Labor has failed in a scandalous fashion on the economy and economic strategy, and when it comes to foreign debt this notorious Labor government has failed totally. But, above all, Labor has failed small business in so many ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people involved in small business are not wealthy, they are ordinary people, as most of the members in this place are ordinary people&mdash;unless they have houses at Woollahra and pig farms and so on. Small business people are hard working, dedicated people who work very long hours, very often seven days a week. I want to refute the claim made by the parliamentary secretary&mdash;and I am sure the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) who is to speak next will say similar things. You have to realise something by looking at the empty shops. Aren't there empty shops in government members' electorates? Do you go around with your eyes closed? I am sure you do. The parliamentary secretary can sit there and say that Townsville has no empty shops, but I don't believe it. They are empty because the people have gone bankrupt. There are empty offices because the firms have gone insolvent under this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers are ruined and are being forced off their land. There are lower incomes for lawyers, accountants and other professional people. There are lower retail sales and vastly reduced housing starts, with a disastrous impact on all the subcontractors. Motor vehicle sales are well and truly down. These are small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the bankruptcy figures, I hope I have time to make the point that bankruptcies&mdash;and the Labor Party can trumpet their so-called success as much as they like&mdash;cannot be ignored. In 1991-92, there were 5,387 business bankruptcies&mdash;up 225 per cent from the number 10 years before. The total business bankruptcies in 10 years to 1991-92 were 27,992.

<PARA>On the face of it, this amendment is quite straightforward. It has been established coalition policy for some years that there be no age discrimination in Australia, and certainly not in the Commonwealth Public Service. We have presented no fewer than four bills on age discrimination in this parliament&mdash;two in the Senate and two in this chamber, both of which had their first reading and never had their second because this government, which believes so much in human rights, chose for all sorts of extraneous reasons not to take the matter further. In the Senate the same thing happened except there, because of the tyranny of numbers against the government, the legislation was actually carried. But, again, it was never introduced for debate in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what can best be described as a legislative stand-off had occurred in both chambers over a similar period of time on what most sensible people would regard as a fundamental human right. What is that fundamental human right? It is the right of every Australian citizen, regardless of their age, to be able to make a contribution to society for as long as they are so able to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill, in its initial form, specified that the new position of deputy chairperson was not to be available to anybody over the age of 65. In other words, it was a clear case of age discrimination in its most obvious form. That is precisely what our legislation on no fewer than four occasions was meant to remove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has been part of the Australian spectrum for many years but, like so many of these issues of human rights, it tends to be involved in obfuscation, ignorance and fundamental lack of real knowledge. I wonder how many members of this chamber, for example, would be aware that in the entire Commonwealth Public Service of well over 150,000 people there are today only 81 who are aged 65. Under the Public Service Act, as it currently stands, there are provisions by which a secretary to a department may permit someone to remain in employment on a very limited basis beyond that age. But the evidence is quite clear that that has not been the rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the concept of retirement at age 55 was introduced, which again is one of the components of the superannuation package, there has been a pronounced view in legislation in this House&mdash;I regret to say that it was passed by both sides back in the 1970s&mdash;that earlier retirement should be favoured over later retirement. But we are told by the government in the context of its superannuation policy looking to the future that in the next 30 years we are going to have twice as many people out of the work force&mdash;they will be dependent to one degree or another on the welfare provisions provided mainly through taxation&mdash;with a ratio of workers to non-workers double what it currently is at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not need to be an intellectual genius, you certainly do not need to be a statistician and you certainly do not need to be an actuary to understand the fundamentals of that proposition. It is simply this: with an ageing society, with a society the age of which is going to get older as people live longer and live longer, healthier lives, the implications for people to retire any time after age 55 will simply mean that the number of years they are going to be available to work and make contributions to superannuation will not be enough to maintain them for that extended lifestyle. This is despite the claim by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that, if somebody gets into the work force at age 25 in the year 2002 or 2003 and for 30 or 40 years continue on an ever raising scale of income and remain in continuous employment, they will be looking at around a quarter of a million&mdash;</PARA>

In conclusion, let me say to him&mdash;I said this to him on the quiet before; I am sure he will not mind my saying it here&mdash;that he does not have to worry about not getting into the ministry because none of his colleagues will get there either after the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The committee's 25th report for 1995 relates to the proposed construction of a purpose-built Commonwealth law courts facility in Melbourne. The building will provide accommodation for the High Court, the Federal Court, the Industrial Relations Court and the Family Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The site for the proposed development is the corner of William and Latrobe Streets, Melbourne, directly opposite Flagstaff Gardens. The estimated total cost of the building, including fitout costs and rise and fall, has been agreed at $108.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, the government decided to provide clearly identifiable and purpose-designed Commonwealth law courts buildings in each capital city to accommodate the courts and associated staff and facilities. The Attorney-General's Department aims to provide the judiciary, legal practitioners, court staff and the public with court facilities which meet the requirements of security and access and have a positive impact on the social and physical environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four jurisdictions currently occupy space in Melbourne at four separate city locations. At all locations the accommodation does not provide adequately for the operational and growth requirements of the courts. In addition, the level of security achievable in these buildings does not provide acceptable protection for judges, staff and the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the development of this proposal, the Attorney-General's Department advised that several options were investigated. These included: refurbishment of existing accommodation; the fitout of leased premises; acquisition of an existing building and converting it to a courts building; or building a purpose-designed facility. The comparison of the options provided to the committee indicates clearly that the construction of a new court complex on the Flagstaff site represents the best value for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In agreeing to the project proceeding, the committee has recommended that the Attorney-General's Department consult with the Victorian government regarding a number of issues, including the possible sharing of library and child-care facilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These appropriation bills seek an additional $1.4 billion of taxpayers' money to continue the business of government. Big spending departments are Defence, DEET, Social Security, and Administrative Services. Included are the legal costs of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in relation to the Marks royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is accepted that there is a role for government in paying legal costs of ministers who are engaged in legal disputes concerning their public and ministerial roles. However, there should be no acceptable argument for the use of taxpayers' money for a minister to try to avoid embarrassment, to avoid fronting up for scrutiny by embarking on legal challenges to stop the process of scrutiny before it could get under way. There should be no case for taxpayers funding the obstruction by the minister for health of the Marks royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister for health frequently asserted that she was looking forward to giving her version of events to the commission, but then used every legal avenue possible to attempt to scuttle the commission. She now wants taxpayers to pay for her attempted obstruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister for health is totally discredited; she has been found by the Marks royal commission to have lied. Some opposite, and chiefly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), have attempted to discredit the Marks royal commission in their attempt to save the minister's skin. Others opposite have privately cringed as they have been asked to support someone who transported the political contamination of WA Inc. into the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some opposite have argued that the royal commission was a political witch-hunt set up simply to discredit the Minister for Human Services and Health. The fact is that the royal commission was set up after two of her former colleagues said that she had lied over what has been known as the Penny Easton affair, a shocking chain of events culminating in a young mother, who had worked as a nurse and a lawyer, committing suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In portraying the royal commission as a witch-hunt, the Labor Party has sought to undermine a member of our judiciary. In doing so, it has threatened the trust Australian people have for one of our most important institutions. Without this trust, we jeopardise the social stability that has set Australia aside from so many other countries torn by social unrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all failed but expensive attempts to stop the royal commission, the minister now stands condemned by the royal commission on the strength of the evidence given by her former colleagues and her former staff. She is condemned on two main grounds: for being untruthful and because her conduct was judged to be improper due to her use of Brian Easton's grievances and allegations for her own political advantage. The royal commissioner found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally speaking it is the weight of the evidence in contradiction of Dr Lawrence's version that requires disbelief.</PARA>
<PARA>Marks continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was however other evidence which strongly undermined the credibility of Dr Lawrence. It did not depend on belief or disbelief of another witness, but solely on what she herself said.</PARA>
<PARA>Examples are given but there can be no more damning example than, and I quote directly from the royal commission report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lawrence even more clearly told an untruth to the Press Club at Canberra on 19 April 1995 when she said that she knew on Wednesday, 4 November, that she would be exonerated in regard to the imprest account:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I clearly want to debunk the claim that I seized on this petition as a way to deflect attention from a police inquiry into my imprest account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that by the day before the tabling of the petition I was already aware that the inquiry was completed and that I would be exonerated and I checked that detail with the lawyer involved yesterday."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the day before the tabling of the petition Dr Lawrence could not have been already aware that she would be exonerated because the decision not to charge her was not made by the police commissioner until the day following the tabling.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no secret that members of parliament are being held in ever diminishing regard by the public. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Human Services and Health and any others who think it is desirable to adopt a personal philosophy that power and personal political gain excuse all else contribute to this diminishing respect and regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of this diminishing respect for elected representatives is diminishing respect for our institutions. Every member of this place should be concerned that in September, 56 per cent of respondents to a Morgan poll agreed that they had lost faith in the political system. Of even more concern is that about 91 per cent endorsed the proposition that politicians twist the truth to suit their own political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Commonwealth Auditor-General John Taylor has argued that democracy cannot work without trust and that politicians who lie break a social contract with the people they represent. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is more than a moral question. It's a practical question. If you can't trust people you can't operate. The leadership has got to come from the top.</PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Marks says in his report that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Representative government is an integral part of our constitutional fabric. The source of power of elected representatives and those selected from them to govern is the people . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a corollary of representative government, so understood, that elected representatives owe the people a duty, akin to that of trustees, in the discharge of their functions and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>In a section of his report under a heading, `Duties of members of parliament as holders of high office', Commissioner Marks writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not surprising that representative government, as explained, gives rise to the expectation that the functions and duties of elected representatives shall be performed openly and with the utmost integrity.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister and others opposite instead of trying to discredit the royal commission should set aside arrogance, listen to what the commissioner had to say and use the commissioner's findings to understand how our institutions are threatened in the absence of a commitment to truth by those who hold public office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been particularly alarmed by those within the government who have attempted to use the minister's gender as the grounds for her defence. On 15 November in the other place, Senator Crowley claimed that the minister for health was the victim of a witch-hunt that `set out to attack a brilliant and successful woman, because a brilliant and successful woman they cannot cope with'&mdash;they being the opposition. Such an accusation is absolutely absurd. As I said earlier, this royal commission came about following accusations made by the minister for health's former Labor colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister herself has sought refuge behind her gender by suggesting that a woman in politics is treated as either a `madonna or a whore'&mdash;an argument that female politicians under scrutiny are treated more harshly than men. To me this is rubbish. It is crucial that women in parliament not be treated differently to their male colleagues. At the same time, women should not use their gender as a refuge from the scrutiny meted out to men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an angle to all this which has received little public comment&mdash;perhaps it has not been politically correct to comment but, in my view, it should be done. We have all seen television images of the minister during her difficulties surrounded by other women&mdash;many of them in powerful positions themselves&mdash;all seen to be carrying flowers. Now I do not condemn this activity&mdash;it is not wrong to give support to those suffering personal difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what I have found beyond my comprehension is that all these women seem to have forgotten that it was the misfortune and difficulties of another young woman whose personal problems were exploited for political gain which led to this whole dreadful saga in the first place. The `sisterhood', for want of another term, does itself untold damage by exercising blind loyalty towards one of their number and simply disregarding the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Labor minister Peter Walsh once referred to the minister for health as Pearl Pureheart. But I believe it says a good deal about the minister's ruthlessness when as Premier of Western Australia&mdash;and she herself knowing what it was like to be a sole parent and also to suffer the pain of divorce&mdash;she could so exploit the difficult personal circumstances of another woman, Penny Easton, a young mother whose marriage break-down and lack of property settlement obviously caused her much pain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition tabled in the Western Australian parliament made matters public that should have remained confidential and within the Family Court. It made accusations against Penny Easton which were found to have no foundations. Penny Easton committed suicide four days after the petition was tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister for health who also assists the Prime Minister for the status of women and women around Australia would do well to remember if they find themselves in positions of power and influence that they have a moral obligation to stand up for those who have less power and are more vulnerable. I caution all who would spring to the minister for health's defence of Commissioner Marks's words on `Duties of members of parliament as holders of high office'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, in these bills the government is appropriating another $1.4 billion of taxpayers' funds for its activities in this financial year. In doing so, the government completely obliterates the $718 million surplus it claimed to have created in this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the urgent need for the government to save rather than spend its way into deficit each year, this continuing failure to contain its spending habit is frightening. This is something even the Treasurer (Mr Willis) understands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his budget speech in May, the Treasurer identified the long-term decline of our national savings as the major constraint on growth, and indeed justified the budget on the grounds that it would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy . . . by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long-term decline of our national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>At least the Treasurer seems to understand the problem&mdash;and it is that Australia's story during the last 13 years of Labor administration is the ever-recurring story of growth constrained by debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always the same: the economy grows and so do the deficits on the current account; the brakes are applied to growth using interest rate hikes and the economy slows; the current account moves back towards balance and interest rates are eased; as they do, the economy begins to grow and, once again, we have a current account blow-out. And so it goes&mdash;each time, those hardest hit by the recession finding it harder and harder to get on their feet as the good times come and then quickly go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not need to be this way. As the Treasurer himself has said, we can&mdash;and again I quote in the hope the government might take heed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy . . . by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long-term decline of our national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>By appropriating another $1.4 billion the government is acting in direct contradiction to the imperative to save implied by the Treasurer. And the government cannot excuse itself from the savings task by arguing that the decline in savings is the private sector's problem. Again, even the Treasurer understands that this is a cop-out. He said in the budget papers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to escape the conclusion that for most of the period under review the most important determinant of the current account deficit was the sizeable public dissaving.</PARA>
<PARA>A conclusion that was set out perfectly clearly for the government as early as 1993 in the report on national saving that it commissioned from Vince FitzGerald, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main contributor to our long-term decline in national saving is the decline in public sector saving.</PARA>
<PARA>In this report FitzGerald also issued an ominous warning which puts the government's refusal to curb its spending habit into a chilling perspective. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we already have a very high foreign debt and a high current account deficit adding constantly to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not save more, then the investment necessary to ensure higher growth and more employment will only be funded by even greater recourse to foreign savings and a further build-up of foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>Today, thanks to a current account record that culminated in a current account deficit for 1994-95 of six per cent of GDP, foreign debt stands at $180 billion and is an overwhelming problem for this country. The most recent edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> said it all:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's excessive reliance on foreign capital leaves the currency and long term interest rates vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A weaker currency would push up the cost of servicing its foreign debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So unless the lucky country becomes a thrifty country, it will be in big trouble.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has gone to considerable effort to disguise the fact that we are, in the words of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, in big trouble. As one member of the Labor caucus, quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 14 September, put it, `Keating made foreign debt sound positively good for you.' The Prime Minister has made foreign debt sound positively good and, in doing so, has exhibited a willingness to deceive the public which echoes that of the minister at the centre of the Marks royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the deception is not contained to this instance. The Minister for Human Services and Health is not alone. For instance, on budget night in May, the Treasurer announced to the nation, `The budget delivers a surplus in 1995-96 of $718 million.' Alan Ramsey's response in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> hit the nail squarely on the head when he said, `To trust this budget you have to trust Paul Keating.' As it turned out, the Treasurer's surplus was not to be trusted; it was a smoke and mirrors fudge job and one had only to turn to the back of the budget papers to find that the adjusted ABS budget figure, which eliminated asset sales and loan repayments from the states and so showed the real state of the books, was really a $8.2 billion deficit. On the link between the foreign debt and interest rates, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 22 September the Treasurer was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Opposition have tried to convince the Australian people that the level of foreign debt is forcing up more mortgage interest rates in this country. That is a monstrous and demonstrable lie. . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no relation whatever between mortgage interest rates and foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA>As Alan Wood so succinctly summed it up in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on the same day, `Wrong, Ralph!' The government's own report on savings, the FitzGerald report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the risks inherent in our high external debt.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that we pay about another $5 to $10 per week on a $100,000 mortgage because of the level of our foreign debt&mdash;something that the Treasurer is unwilling to come clean about to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) manage to get any closer to the truth in his portfolio area? As a way of justifying the government's lack of action on the unemployment front, the minister continues to claim that the government is on track to meet its target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. Yet this is patently untrue. As Labor said in its Working Nation statement of May 1994, `We have got to grow at something like four to 4.5 per cent to keep unemployment coming down.' We are currently growing at well below four per cent, and this cycle's decline in the unemployment rate stopped decisively at 8.2 per cent a number of months ago. Since then, we have had monthly unemployment rates of 8.3 per cent, then 8.5 per cent and most recently 8.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really cannot put it any better than the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 8 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Crean claims we are on track to cut unemployment to 5 per cent. At best he is deluded and at worst Mr Crean is not telling the truth.</PARA>
<PARA>I could go on and on. The Prime Minister claimed in 1992 that he would not increase taxes in his next term of government. He claimed that he had no intention of reneging on the second round of One Nation tax cuts, saying, `They are not a promise. They are law&mdash;l-a-w law.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Not telling the truth', as the editorial from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> so delicately put it, is now a habit for this government and it is in this sense that the Minister for Human Services and Health is not alone. She came to this place with much fanfare; much was written and said about how the Prime Minister had persuaded her to leave Western Australian politics and enter the federal parliament. This was meant to be a great plus for Labor, guaranteed to get them the women's vote. Now the Prime Minister is trying to keep the minister in cabinet and in so doing is departing from convention. The minister should resign. She has been found guilty. The parliaments of Australia need men and women of ability and integrity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Next March when honourable members are watching the 1996 Transurban Australian Grand Prix from Melbourne they may well ask themselves why a consortium essentially only important to Melbourne&mdash;in fact to one particular project in Melbourne&mdash;is featured so prominently in an international event. It would be a valid question. Many Victorians are already asking themselves that very question. Today in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> Kenneth Davidson says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry about the Kennett Government and its mates. Transurban sponsors for the Grand Prix? Are they serious?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would any corporate entity, seeking to boost its corporate image or the profile for its products or services, sponsor the Grand Prix? It does not require a degree in marketing to see that sponsorship of this event would be corporate poison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would Telstra, which knocked back the chance, want to pay $8 million a year to sponsor an event that is deeply affronting to, conservatively, at least 10 to 20 per cent of Melbourne's population and which will need most of the Victorian police force to ensure that it goes ahead without violent protest?</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to dwell on the aspects of the Grand Prix but I certainly want to dwell on the project of the Transurban consortium, City Link, and the process by which it has been developed so far, as it is part of a very worrying trend in the state of Victoria. As the headline in the Davidson article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> today says, `Time to question the decision process.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This trend sees increasingly more projects exempted from the usual practices of environmental and community scrutiny and sees legal rights to redress potential injustices severely curtailed. An environmental effects statement has not been prepared for the proposed expansion of the Tullamarine Freeway. The City Link Bill exempts the entire project from the Planning and Environment Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just what is the City Link project? Briefly, it is a road complex that will join the Tullamarine Freeway from where it ends on the outskirts of the central business district to the existing south-eastern arterial road. It involves a new bridge over the Yarra and a tunnel beneath the Yarra River and the Domain park. In addition, as I have said, the Tullamarine Freeway will be extended. There will be a toll for the use of the City Link, depending on the length travelled. Transponders attached to the windshields of cars will be read by overhead meters. These meters will be placed in three strategic positions along the City Link project&mdash;at Bulla Road on the Tullamarine Freeway, in the Domain tunnel complex and at Toorak Road at the end of the existing south-east arterial. The amount charged for each section of the journey will be deducted from the transponder's memory. Motorists will have to purchase the transponder before travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In getting to this position in promoting the City Link, the Victorian government has had very little consultation. For instance, there was no consultation with residents whose homes will disappear for the project. They were informed of the state government's plans, on the day the route of the project was announced, by a `To the Householder' letter. There has been no consultation with the broader community which will be affected by the impact of private sector tolls on the proposed roads. Once the state legislation that allows for this project, the City Link Bill, becomes law, there will be no opportunity for community input. All rights are removed and all appeal rights are removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The City Link Bill removes any necessity for Transurban to examine the effect of the project on the Yarra River or on Moonee Ponds Creek and the noise impact for residents along City Link. There is no requirement for Transurban to meet EPA pollution standards. In the great tradition of the Kennett government, the City Link Bill also limits the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Victoria in relation to City Link matters through a variation of the Constitution Act, thus joining the 30 or more other pieces of legislation exempted by amendments to the Constitution Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will give Transurban powers and indemnities normally only accorded to public bodies, bodies that are accountable to parliament. This is an unprecedented exemption to a private company. The Supreme Court will be unable to examine matters relating to any failure to follow planning procedures or compensation for the impact of City Link other than is provided for in the bill. The unprecedented actions of the government of Victoria to guarantee Transurban the profitability of the City Link project go to the very heart of issues of accountability and responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the road closures and changes that the state government will finance; there are many other examples of the state government using its powers to guarantee a private sector monopoly a profit. The last state budget committed $300 million towards the project to acquire the land for its use and to help finance the so-called gateway monuments to Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett, such as the 120-metre twin towers on the new Yarra Bridge and the 70-metre yellow beam. Transurban will be exempted from paying land tax, stamp duty, local government rates, water rates and building levies&mdash;worth millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Policing and enforcing the compliance with tolls will be the responsibility of VicRoads, a state government agency. This means that a division of a statutory authority of the state government will be accountable for collecting the turnover for a private consortium and financing this collection. For the first 20 years of the contract, Transurban is guaranteed toll increases of 4 1/2 per cent per year or the inflation rate, whichever is the greater. Profits are thus guaranteed, because in times of low inflation Transurban is able to increase tolls over and above the inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the most disturbing aspects of the City Link project are the circumstances under which the state government will compensate Transurban if certain action affects its ability to make a profit. These include some actions over which any future state government will have absolutely no control. If the Commonwealth government, for instance, conducts an environmental impact statement and the outcome delays the start of the project, the state government has to reimburse Transurban for the extra costs arising from the delay. Transurban can have the contract terminated if state government action results in tollway revenue falling by 20 per cent. If certain events occur that have an adverse effect on tollway revenue, Transurban can claim compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These circumstances include a future state government building a rapid rail link to the airport or any new road or surface deemed to have a detrimental effect on tollway revenue. A rapid rail link to Tullamarine airport from the central activities district should have been considered in conjunction with or at the same time as consideration of City Link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters that might lead to compensation include removal of parking restrictions, road closures and narrowings proposed to force people to use the City Link. They include future changes to state taxes and charges and the tollway enforcement arrangements, such as a future decision of a state government to make it no longer an offence to not pay the toll. The Kennett government has ensured that every avenue is covered to limit the actions of future state governments with regard to the City Link project. These limitations are contained in the ironclad contract between the Transurban consortium and the state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when governments&mdash;state and federal&mdash;have signed up for the implementation of a national competition policy, the City Link project must surely represent the very antithesis of competition and what competition is all about. For many who have always harboured reservations about the implementation of competition policy, it is sold to us on the basis that it has the potential, when undertaken properly, to benefit the people we represent. We are told that competition policy has the potential to deliver those people goods and services that reduce rates and give real choices. City Link must surely be an example of a complete absence of competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only will the state government refuse to examine proposals for extended public transport facilities to the airport; it wishes to close roads, remove clearways and put additional parking on some of Melbourne's major arterial roads. This is all to ensure that commuters are forced to use City Link and Transurban is guaranteed its profit. Commuters are consumers too, especially if they have to pay tolls. They are entitled to the same choices as other consumers and are entitled to choose not to use City Link if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A project which so flagrantly violates the federal&mdash;in fact, the national&mdash;competition policy should not dare to seek the assistance of the federal government in its implementation. The City Link project is essentially about government action to support a private sector monopoly&mdash;grossly at odds with any form of competition. The City Link project creates obvious concerns for Commonwealth transport policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the One Nation project, the federal government has spent $20 million to upgrade the South Dynon railway terminal. This is part of the federal government's commitment to improving national railway infrastructure. The state government's plan to reduce Footscray Road from eight to four lanes to force commuters to use City Link has serious implications for access to the South Dynon terminal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government should be concerned that it has invested millions in a project only to have that investment undermined by the actions of the state government. The federal government has a legitimate interest in proper and efficient transport networks and puts considerable funds into road building. All members should be concerned that transport policy in Victoria seems to be dictated by a private monopoly ability to make a profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people claim to be unconcerned about this and not to care about the actions of the Kennett government with regard to its business dealings. If they are not concerned about City Link because they do not live in the northern, western or south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, if they are not concerned because they will not need to use City Link on a regular basis and if they are not concerned about the as yet unknown environmental effects of this project, then they should be concerned about democracy in Victoria. The story surrounding this project is of concern to anyone who believes in the responsibility and accountability of governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Victorians have come increasingly to see the state government, the casino, the Grand Prix and Transurban as essentially different branches of the same operation. But by looking for Commonwealth assistance for the project, whether it be in the form of taxation breaks or infrastructure bonds funding, the state government of Victoria is seeking to implicate the Commonwealth in this City Link project. To this end, I have joined with a number of my colleagues from the northern and western suburbs in calling upon the Commonwealth government to ensure that a proper environmental impact appraisal takes place on this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much earlier, when the only project envisaged was the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway, we likewise called upon the Victorian government to carry out such an environmental impact assessment. There was an indication from the Premier that the proposal was being advertised as part of a planning scheme amendment and was being assessed in accordance with Victoria's Planning and Environment Act 1987. Of course, that process has been thrown out of the window because the City Link&mdash;through the City Link legislation&mdash;has been exempted from those environmental assessment procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), Senator Kim Carr and Senator Barney Cooney and I are seeking an assurance that the Commonwealth&mdash;because the project will be looking for forms of taxation breaks&mdash;will look at the need for a proper environmental assessment. I urge the Commonwealth government to think very carefully before becoming in any way involved in this fiasco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another roads matter I wish to touch upon in this appropriation debate has a direct impact on the electorate of Scullin. It is the proposed F2 freeway along Merri Creek between the Western Ring Road and Craigieburn. The F2 freeway is simply the extension of the Hume Highway along a different alignment. As the Hume Highway is a declared national highway, any realignment of its route would become a concern of the federal government as it would form part of the national highways. Again, I think this is a project that we cannot hide from. The Commonwealth government has to recognise that it has a direct responsibility to ensure that this road is built with due consideration to all environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Organisations that have been concerned with the preservation of Merri Creek have contacted me. Their interest in this project has come about because the portion of the Western Ring Road between Mahoneys Road and Dalton Road is going through the planning stage. Whilst this is not a part of a national highway and not a Commonwealth responsibility, the two kilometres from Mahoneys Road to the end of the F2 freeway potentially could become declared national roads in that they join up with the national highway. Therefore, those organisations have been alerted that the Commonwealth may have an interest only because of that aspect. But, as I have indicated to them, this is not something that the Commonwealth can walk away from, because the overall F2 freeway project will be something that we have an interest in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The proposed alignment of the F2 freeway goes through three sensitive areas along Merri Creek: the first, just north of Mahoneys Road, is the proposed metropolitan park, which is based on a retarding basin in the Thomastown-Campbellfield area; the second, further north along the route of the freeway alignment, is a grasslands area of state significance in the vicinity of Cooper Street; and then the third, just south of Craigieburn and at the end of the reservation, is an area of grasslands of national significance. It is that third area that I wish to highlight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that area is of sufficient concern that should necessitate the Commonwealth seeking the cooperation of the state government&mdash;and VicRoads is the authority that is involved in this project&mdash;in reassessing the alignment of the road and in carrying out a proper environmental impact of any new route that is envisaged. I also call upon the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) to ensure that ANCA, as the appropriate body, has sufficient funding made available to continue the purchase of this land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, there are a number of species of remnant native grasslands that are important. But there are also two species that live in this habitat that are on the Endangered Species Protection Act; the plains wanderer and the striped legless lizard. I hope that both the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the minister for the environment will take a personal interest in this proposal for the F2 freeway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I do not envisage that it would gain a high priority at this point in time in our national highways program, now is the time when proper planning is being put in place to ensure that the road alignment is improved. I do not see the necessity of having a road alignment over a seven- to eight-kilometre journey which crosses Merri Creek on three occasions. There is surely an alignment that is open for the road planners to ensure that the effect upon Merri Creek is minimised and that the grasslands that are affected by the present alignment are preserved and protected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These three appropriation bills were introduced on 26 October. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1995-96 authorises the Minister for Finance to issue an additional $836,356,000 from the consolidated revenue fund, in addition to funds appropriated by the Appropriation Act (No. 1) 1995-96 for the annual services of government. This additional appropriation will be predominantly divided between the Departments of Defence; Employment, Education and Training; Social Security; and Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS>, most of these additional outlays will be due to wage rises under the Australian Public Service workplace agreement 1992-94 and the 1995-96 APS enterprise agreement. The original government strategy for enterprise bargaining in the Australian Public Service entailed a service wide agreement, followed by agency agreements. These agency agreements were supposed to set out goals for productivity improvements and corresponding wage rises as the goals were met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raised the prospect of public servants at the same designation and increment in different agencies receiving different rates of pay&mdash;I might add by way of digression that there are shades of Weipa and CRA in all of this. The base rates would remain the same across the APS, but wages were to be topped up in those that met their goals. This makes pretty good sense where all agencies start from the same level of productivity and all are capable of improving productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the truth is that departments such as Social Security had less scope for productivity gains because it had already undertaken widespread reform and productivity improvements in the 1980s; whereas departments such as Employment, Education and Training had just embarked on the process of reform. The result was that certain departments, which had earlier been slow to embrace change, could afford to provide pay rises under the agency agreements, whereas those which had shown a longer commitment to increased productivity were less able to give their employees productivity related pay increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under agency agreements, a ceiling was placed on wage rises, with surplus gains going into an APS wide pool and shared out amongst all departments. That helped restore some equity, but it also rewarded those departments which did not even bother to formulate an agency agreement. Even the Department of Industrial Relations, which is supposed to provide advice on the formulation of agency agreements, only cobbled an agreement together for its own department at the very last moment&mdash;I have little doubt it only put that agreement together to avoid embarrassment at having none at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of particular interest is that the government in the latest agreement has come to the realisation that a unified APS needs a uniform wage structure. The Australian Public Service needs to be made more efficient and certainly more effective. Increased productivity and a reappraisal of functions are required, with the savings returned to the nation's taxpayers. </PARA>

But should the Australian taxpayer have to foot the bill for attempts by the minister to stop, stifle, or otherwise derail the commission before it even got going? In that case my answer is obviously, beyond any doubt, no. </PARA>

The federal parliament should not pay the New South Wales government money for the Fox studios. It is as simple as that. If the New South Wales government does not want to pay the additional $7 million, there are certainly plenty of other states that want the Fox studio and will pay to get it. Mr Egan, the New South Wales Treasurer, has already said that he can plug any funding gap. He can find the $7 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This begs the question: why is the Commonwealth delivering these funds which are clearly not needed? It seems to be simple. Our Prime Minister foresees problems in marginal New South Wales seats. That can be the only reasonable explanation. He wants new movie studios, he wants world class arts facilities, he wants great architecture, and he wants it all in Sydney&mdash;except when he wants them in Tokyo or Berlin. Sydney is everything to our Prime Minister and he wants all Australians to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of Prime Minister gets bogged down in argument with a New South Wales state government because he wants that government to move the Cahill Expressway and a railway line from Circular Quay? The Prime Minister should realise that he is not the Prime Minister of Sydney and, as such, has wider federal responsibilities, which include a faltering economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an interesting case study of our Prime Minister's imperial delusions and of how the New South Wales Right is prepared to look after its own to the detriment of the overall national interest. If he has a cool $7 million to spare for the arts, why not make it available to them up front rather than subsidise the New South Wales government by the back door? The Prime Minister and his government need to focus on the real issues, not the trivial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the current position in our great nation? We had an illusory budget surplus of $718 million, which was nothing more than a public relations trick to fool the public into believing that the government had finally become serious and capable about national saving and the public contribution to national saving. In the back of the budget papers, the real underlying structural budget deficit showed the excess of spending over revenue was actually just over $8 billion. This deceit by Labor was bad enough, yet the way things are currently looking there is no way that Labor can deliver even its illusory budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has failed so far to meet its privatisation timetable. In some ways, it is an Irish privatisation timetable when we consider not only that the Australian Industry Development Corporation has not been privatised but also that the government has increased the capital of the AIDC to the tune of $200 million. That is reverse privatisation, and very expensive too. There have been budget blow-outs everywhere, with backdowns on some tax measures, failed privatisations and commitments to increased expenditures across many areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Des Moore of the Institute of Public Affairs actually believes the deficit for 1995-96 will now be about $1 billion. It goes without saying that this is a significant reversal on what the government stated it would try to achieve at budget time. However, it also throws into serious doubt the projections for the next few years during which the government claimed to have the capacity to further increase the size of that illusory surplus. As Des Moore said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review </EMPHASIS>of 20 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More generally, this blowout significantly detracts from the credibility of the government's forward estimates beyond 1995-96. Those estimates provided for an annual current account surplus of around 0.5 per cent of GDP. That was always too small a contribution to saving by the Commonwealth. But what price now on there being any contribution at all?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Des Moore leaves his article with that question&mdash;highly pertinent, but totally without answer by Labor, which should be severely embarrassed by its lack of fiscal discipline. This situation must surely be related to the coming election. Of great concern is the similarity of this government in the junking of its fiscal policy to that of the Kirner government in Victoria immediately before its demise. It is amazing how the smell of an imminent election campaign can so quickly cause a Labor government to abandon responsible acts. We are also witnessing an increase in the rate of unemployment, which is to be deplored. It is now nationally at around 8.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) crows about job growth over the past two years, yet the facts speak for themselves. Unemployment is not coming down and will probably increase again. The government's response to unemployment is this Working Nation nonsense. That is a sham. Even the Department of Finance has apparently evaluated the performance of Working Nation and found it to be a wanton waste of taxpayers' funds. It is nothing more than a public relations gimmick. As the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) said earlier today in the discussion of a matter of public importance, to get the unemployed into training programs and have them come out still unemployed only affects the figures, the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest benefit for Working Nation claimed by the minister is the reduction in the number of long-term unemployed. The real rate of long-term unemployment is not much different today than it was 12 months ago. Make no mistake. If you move long-term unemployed into training programs and subsequently back on to the unemployment benefit, they are still long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that New Zealand, our often much-maligned trans-Tasman neighbour, has an unemployment rate of around 6.1 per cent. New Zealand did not require a nonsense program like Working Nation. They have achieved rapid job growth by reforming the industrial relations system and putting in place policies to encourage faster economic growth. New Zealand has done this while keeping inflation in check at around two per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to join this debate to endorse some of the comments and adopt some of the positions taken previously in the debate by my colleague the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). I begin by saying that all my life I have been a resident of Melbourne and a proud member of that community. I served in the Victorian parliament for many years. I am deeply concerned about the future of my city and my community. I am concerned at the abuse of parliamentary process, the total erosion of the principles of the Westminster system which, despite complaints from members of the opposition&mdash;thank God&mdash;still operate in this House. I am ashamed of some of my parliamentary colleagues opposite who, like me, are Melburnians but berate the government day after day in this place and turn their backs because they do not want to see or they do not want to know or they simply choose to ignore what is going on, not merely in their own state but in their own electorates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What occurred in the Victorian parliament last fortnight has got to be a matter of deep concern to all Victorian parliamentarians, or federal parliamentarians who come from Victoria, in terms of the use of parliamentary majorities in both houses of parliament to impose a tax burden on the people of Victoria for a period of 34 years in respect of the City Link project, a project about which the opposition in the parliament, after a very short briefing, provided the government with 76 questions that go to the whole structure and nature of that relationship. As the parliament gets up, something like 18 have been answered. Ministers made statements in the parliament a fortnight ago to repudiate their own statements and to indicate that they either did not know all the facts or they lied. What we have operating in my state, to the deep and profound regret of its citizens, is a political process which ought to be a matter of deep shame to every member of the coalition and a matter of deep shame to anybody who believes in parliamentary democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often take parliamentary democracy for granted, but the reality is that the fundamental nature of our institution is that those who are elected to govern have a responsibility not merely to the people who have voted for them as a political party but to the broad community. They exercise a trust in terms of the traditions of that parliament and if they are going to embark upon major areas of expenditure, if they are going to embark upon something which will impose a toll on every road user in the state&mdash;an increasing toll for a period of over 30 years&mdash;I think they have a duty to the community, to their own supporters and to those who voted against them to explain the benefits, to explain the burdens, and to indicate how it will all operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an interest in this parliament. When we are looking at the question of infrastructure in the states&mdash;and we are all Australians&mdash;one of the better developments under this government has been a commitment to provide funds to state governments to develop infrastructure, whether it is in road funding, in education, in hospital services or in the building of roads. Many of the finest roads that now exist in Victoria have been as a result of that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we justify a situation where the government does not disclose fully the nature of the transactions that it has entered into with a private consortium, where it is limiting the size of some major roads, roads which were funded? I am talking about Footscray Road, which links the western suburbs with the city and with my own electorate. It was widened and reconstructed to increase the flow of traffic. Because of a private agreement it is now going to be narrowed in order to force users of that road onto a toll freeway. What is the logic and what is the justification?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Scullin has outlined many of the unanswered questions. In Victoria at present the duty of the government of the day&mdash;of any government&mdash;is to come clean and explain the details of its transactions. But what you do is ram legislation through the parliament because you have the numbers in both houses. Ministers have either lied or are not able to answer the questions that are put to them. When the legislation is through&mdash;and there is an ongoing financial commitment on behalf of Victorian taxpayers for up to 34 years&mdash;and you are asked for the detail of who is getting what, the answer is: `You are not entitled to know; it is a matter of commercial-in-confidence.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there has been a subversion of the democratic process, if ever there has been an exercise where the electorate is treated with contempt, where private profit on behalf of the selective few who have the confidence of the Premier and his cronies is more important than the rights of citizens to know, it is in Victoria. No explanation is given. No justification is even attempted. My colleagues opposite in this House whose electorates are affected, whose constituents are affected, remain mute, silent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are environmental issues involved. What is the point of the Commonwealth providing funds to the state of Victoria for infrastructures and road funding if the state of Victoria and the Premier of Victoria in an exercise of cosy complicity&mdash;the Transurban Corporation&mdash;can make a set of commercial deals which are going to affect the pocket of every Victorian citizen, and the details of which, if you can get them, have to be gouged out because they are commercial-in-confidence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arrangement that has been made is going to affect small businesses in certain areas of Melbourne. It is going to affect those involved in the freight industry. It is going to involve the commercial life of our community. Let us look at some of the principles involved. First of all, you have an agreement that locks Victorians into tolls for a period of 34 years. Secondly, the Premier has made it perfectly clear that these arrangements can be extended virtually to any other road or any other freeway in any part of the state. What is the logic of narrowing a road to force transport to use a toll freeway except to enhance the profits of the operator of the freeway? This technology is going to finish up affecting other major highways throughout the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is built into this agreement a 4.5 per cent or higher inflation rate. That means that by the time City Link is finished you will not be paying $3 to use the tollway; you will be paying closer to $3.77. By the year 2000 that will go up to close to $6. One effect of this will be that motorists, in order to avoid the tollway, will then enter smaller suburban streets&mdash;streets where kids play, streets which are basically there for the use of local residents. It is a crazy situation&mdash;a very large sum of money over a period of time is going to be used to enhance the use of the motor car. At the same time the government of Victoria, which is hot to trot on the Grand Prix, knows that the only way it can handle the crowds which are likely to attend that function is by getting people to leave their cars in some cases some kilometres away from the actual site and encouraging them to use public transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No detailed analysis has been made of this proposition. The Auditor-General has not examined it. The RACV, on the basis of what knowledge was available to it, has made an examination and has proven in surveys that what will happen is that it will force more and more motorists off the major arterial road into suburban back streets. What occurs if the Commonwealth decides, as I would hope at some stage it would, to provide finance to support the state of Victoria in building a rail link from Spencer Street station to Tullamarine airport? I am not talking about old technology; I am talking about perhaps systems like the Maglev fast train that operate in Germany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, if people choose to use that link, as I think they would, there would be a drop in the usage of the existing freeway. The owner of Citylink would have to be compensated&mdash;and by whom? By the Victorian taxpayer. What kind of deal is that? The Victorian taxpayer is going to pay twice. The concept of the Commonwealth providing funds to assist in the development of infrastructure&mdash;and transport is a major part of it&mdash;is key to the future entire economic development of the state, especially Melbourne. What is the point of the Commonwealth doing that, if all you are doing is providing an additional tax burden on Victorian citizens?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major road, Toorak Road, is going to be affected. Part of it runs through my electorate and the major part of it runs through the electorate of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). Do we hear him berating and ranting and talking about corruption? When it comes to his colleagues in Victoria he is mute even when the position of the local commissioners has been publicly misrepresented. When the parliament of Victoria was told they supported these concepts, it had to be denied, not by the elected councillors but by people put there by the Victorian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole concept is not just a matter of states rights; it is a matter of people's rights. States do not have rights; they have obligations and duties. People have rights&mdash;and the people of Victoria have rights. In my view, it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth if it is going to put money into building up the infrastructure of the states; it is the duty of the minister for transport and the minister for conservation to ensure the integrity of the private deals made behind closed doors. The details are not available to the Victorian parliament, details which bind the average citizen, particularly those living on the outskirts of Melbourne, to having their hands in their pockets on a daily basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the responsibility of federal ministers, who are prepared to make funds available to build infrastructures in the city, to see that the money they spend not only is properly spent but is not used or abused by its enabling the present government of Victoria to evade its responsibility to its citizens, to abuse the democratic processes of the parliament, and to keep the average Victorian in the dark while it makes its deals with private companies. Then, when pressed to provide information it uses a new and novel concept, `We cannot say, because it is all business in confidence.' That means that private profit is more important than exercising its responsibility to the electors of the state of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge federal ministers&mdash;and there are a number of them involved&mdash;to examine this transaction very closely. I do not believe that it would withstand proper or effective examination. I adopt the arguments and concerns of my colleague the member for Scullin and I invite some of the gentlemen opposite, whose constituents are going to be affected by this, to at least stand up for what used to be old-time liberal principles. The small businessman and the average citizen are going to be affected, not for the benefit of the state but for the benefit ultimately of a private consortium which has happened to please the ego or whatever of the Premier of the state of Victoria. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current interest in treaties which has existed for some time continues unabated. Only this week members of this House were circulated with a copy of a discussion paper produced by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reforming Australia's treaty making processes</EMPHASIS>. The ACCI, along with a number of other bodies, has had an interest in this subject and has made previous contributions to the public debate in the form of lengthy press releases during 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interest in the making of treaties has been generated by concerns at their growing significance, particularly in so far as they have legislative importance within the country. It has also been generated by an apparent decline in the accountability of the executive in relation to the making of treaties; a decline in consultation by the executive with interest groups, including state and territory governments; and a declining involvement of the legislature, in particular this parliament, in their making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those concerns have been expressed in a number of quarters and at a number of levels. One level of concern is on the international plane. It is feared by some that the commitment to international obligations involves a surrendering of national sovereignty. At another level, the plenary role of the executive in negotiating, signing and ratifying treaties to the exclusion of the legislature has raised another aspect of what has been referred to as the democratic deficit. That term was coined, I believe, by Sir Ninian Stephen in the Sir Earl Page Memorial Trust Lecture which he gave in September 1994. The critics refer to the non-accountability of the executive, which is under no formal obligation to consult state and territory governments, even as to matters within state and territory legislative power, or to consult affected interest groups&mdash;or even to consult the public generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treaties do have an important effect. Those effects are presently under close consideration. The traditional principle has been that, by entering into a treaty, Australia becomes obliged at international law to implement the terms of the treaty into domestic law but that, until the domestic legislation is enacted, the treaty is not part of the law of Australia or of any Australian state or territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally, however, courts have regarded the terms of the treaty as relevant to the interpretation of a statute and have generally sought to construe a statute consistently with the terms of an unimplemented treaty. The recent response of the government, in the form of the introduction of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995, to the decision of the High Court in the case of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Ah Hin Teoh shows that the role of treaties, like the process for making them, is being subjected to pressure for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to go into that subject. However, it is pertinent to mention that the report for 1994-95 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was tabled in this House today. In that report, the president of the commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, repeated the commission's grave concerns about the Teoh bill and its proposed limiting of the impact of treaties as signed by Australia but not enacted in domestic law and its particular impact upon several treaties which HREOC oversees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns relate to the lack of consultation by the Commonwealth government with state and territory governments and interest groups. There is no formal procedure or mechanism for public consultation on treaties under consideration. Whether interest groups are consulted really depends upon the decision of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and any line or portfolio department involved in the negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1992, there have been procedures in place for reference to the standing committee on treaties comprising senior Commonwealth, state and territory officers who meet twice a year. The functions of that committee, however, are quite limited and do not envisage public consultation. The committee is only a mechanism for the provision of information on treaty negotiations and implementation and a mechanism for facilitating state and territory involvement in negotiating delegations. It is not a body to which the substance or merits of a treaty proposal are referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A disturbing aspect of the treaty making process is the increasing downgrading of the function of making treaties&mdash;a plenary function of the executive&mdash;within the executive. It has recently been highlighted that a treaty signed or ratified for Australia does not need the approval of cabinet. The present procedures involve the approval of only the Federal Executive Council, theoretically a body of higher rank but not a body to which the substance or merits of a treaty will be committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of treaties is such in the eyes of the government that the approval of cabinet is not always obtained. It is treated as adequate that the Executive Council is simply assured, in the absence of cabinet approval, that the matters concerned fall within the scope of existing policy, that all relevant ministers have agreed to it and that the Prime Minister has agreed to or been informed of the action proposed. Since 1990, it appears that less than one-quarter of treaties to which Australia has become a party have been deemed to have required cabinet approval for final consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to parliamentary involvement, the situation is even more bleak. The Commonwealth parliament has no constitutional role or otherwise in relation to the approval, signing or ratification of treaties. The only role of any real significance is that it implements treaty obligations domestically by passing legislation. In principle, this is a subsidiary role. The substance of the domestic legislation required to implement the treaty is determined by the substance of the treaty obligations. They are a fait accompli when the matter comes before this parliament. All the parliament can do is, in effect, determine the form of the legislation in which the substantive obligations will be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For at least 13 years, treaties have been referred to this parliament only by being tabled in batches every six months. They are now tabled under a deemed tabling procedure, which means that they do not get physically tabled. They are treated as tabled by being delivered to the Clerk. The only record that appears of the tabling is what appears in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Votes and Proceedings </EMPHASIS>the following day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some considerable time, there have been calls for a greater role for parliament in the treaty making process. Those calls have come from a diverse range of persons and bodies. They include members of the Constitutional Commission, which reported in 1988, and a variety of peak industry bodies, including the ACCI. Sir Ninian Stephen has made a plea, as has Justice Michael Kirby. The numerous participants at a conference conducted by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation in May on `Australian governance in a global society' unanimously called for a role for the parliament in relation to the approval of treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has had its proposals for reform of the treaty making processes on the table for some time. They were outlined by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in October last year. The particular initiatives include the preparation of cost benefit analyses for the benefit of parliament in relation to each treaty prior to its ratification; the tabling of treaties in parliament with a provision for debate prior to ratification; the establishment of a treaties council as part of the Council of Australian Governments, or COAG; the enactment of domestic legislation prior to ratification; and the establishment of a parliamentary treaties committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commented on the proposal to establish the parliamentary treaties committee in a speech I delivered on the grievance debate on 23 October. I explained in that speech the nature of the proposal as I see it. I now want to add some further comments. In offering those comments, I seek to anticipate some possible criticisms of the coalition proposal and offer answers to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One likely criticism is that there are already too many parliamentary committees and to create another committee for treaties would add to the burden. It is true that there are quite a number of parliamentary committees, but there are many more in the Senate than in this House. What is proposed is a joint committee, and there are presently only 12 of them. The principal answer, however, is not that the number of joint committees is not that large. The principal answer is that the subject of treaties is very important and justifies the attention of a parliamentary committee. Given the significance of treaties for domestic legislation&mdash;making a treaty is commonly, although not always, a step in the legislative process&mdash;the involvement of both houses is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question which would have to be addressed in relation to a committee at some stage is what, for the purposes of the role of that committee, constitutes a treaty. There is quite a range of international bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral agreements. Many international agreements emanate in different forms from multilateral organisations of which Australia is a member. There is really no need for a narrow definition for the terms of reference of the committee, but it would probably need to be defined, at least broadly, for the benefit of the departments which would be involved in reporting to the committee. The committee itself could learn from its own experience in dealing with the range of diverse forms of international agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is relevant to the role of the proposed committee that Australia becomes a party by signature, ratification or other process to literally scores of treaties each year. Many take years to negotiate and they go through many drafts in their gestation. Given their number, it would be appropriate for the parliamentary treaties committee to review a treaty at the latest stage possible, preferably immediately before signature, or after signature and before ratification. That would eliminate a review of the many drafts through which some treaties go. However, that should not prevent the committee of its own initiative from examining a draft at an earlier stage. This could be particularly appropriate where international participants appear to be taking the draft terms of a treaty in directions not appropriate or palatable to Australia or its interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the large number of treaties under consideration at any given time and the diversity of subject matter, a parliamentary treaties committee would need to give close consideration to what it should examine in relation to each treaty. It could then attempt to regularise the procedures it employs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some aspects would be common to different types of treaties and could be examined as a matter of course. Identification of those aspects would enable the committee to begin the process of developing a set of principles and guidelines for its own reference, or even a charter to guide the scrutiny. Other committees have done this, particular examples that can be offered are the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It is accepted that those committees have much simpler tasks than a treaties committee would have, but the principles are the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If guidelines, as I suggest, were developed, the secretariat of the committee would be able to do standard reports on treaties which are regularly made with different parties on the same or similar subject matter&mdash;extradition treaties might be such a category, as might reciprocal tax treaties. The upshot of the development of guidelines could in due course be that the parliamentary treaties committee secretariat would do regular reports raising no concerns on which the committee itself would need only to note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar procedure could be utilised in relation to the numerous protocols or agreements which amend principal treaties or international agreements. In many cases the amendment is minor and could be dealt with simply by a short report from the secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the coalition reform proposals is one that a cost benefit analysis be prepared for each treaty under consideration for adherence by Australia. The committee would provide a useful reference point for the examination of the analyses. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would have at least a coordinating role in relation to the preparation of such analyses, but in many cases the preparation of it would be the function of a line department or a portfolio department. With experience, the committee could develop, again, principles or guidelines for the scrutiny of the analyses, thereby assisting the departments in the preparation of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition proposal envisages that the parliamentary treaties committee would examine whether legislation would be necessary in order to implement a treaty. This would be a very important role. The assertion is regularly made by the government&mdash;and in this case DFAT publications are relevant&mdash;that legislation is always put in place before a treaty is ratified. I personally regard that as a false assertion, at least at present. It could become fact, or at least could have a greater element of truth, if there were a parliamentary treaties committee which had a responsibility for examining whether legislation was necessary. If it were necessary, it could examine whether it already existed or was about to be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a variety of reasons, legislation to implement a treaty may in fact not be necessary. This could be because the obligations undertaken by Australia in the treaty could be met either within the country or overseas by the executive without the need for legislative authority. Examples in this respect might be treaties on defence cooperation or on the provision of aid to developing countries. In other cases, there will already be state laws in place which will be adequate for the purpose. This occurs in relation to a number of International Labour Organisation conventions to which Australia has adhered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other cases, existing legislation will serve whatever purpose is required. In this respect extradition legislation would be already in place. But it is important that the question be asked independently, and particularly on behalf of the legislature in relation to each treaty, whether legislation is necessary and, if it is, whether it has been enacted. This could prevent precipitate ratification of treaties before the nature of the legislation required was identified, as occurred, for example, in relation to the adherence to ILO convention No. 158. It would also help in the adoption of a cooperative federalist approach to the making of treaties in which the Commonwealth does not need to override the states using the external affairs power but would cooperate with the states in putting appropriate state legislation on the books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special mention should be made of the role of state and territory governments. A parliamentary treaties committee, as envisaged under coalition proposals, would not focus on state and territory issues as they would be dealt with under the proposed treaty council, the establishment of which is also recommended in the coalition treaty proposals. A parliamentary treaties committee would enable this parliament to fulfil its proper role in relation to the making of treaties, and in particular to focus on whether or not legislation is necessary to implement obligations undertaken or about to be undertaken on behalf of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to respond to the thoughtful contribution of the honourable for Tangney (Mr Williams). From my perspective, I am always a supporter of wanting to make the legislature, particularly this House, more relevant and more real to the operations of Australia. Therefore, as a democrat, I actually support that there should be a treaties committee of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me be quite frank and say that, whilst I do not ascribe the motives to the honourable member for Tangney, there is some concern on this side of the House that the proposed treaties committee is really a device for opposing treaties rather than having a more constructive role of examining treaties. I would also like to draw to the attention of the House that the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in its peacekeeping report suggested, for example, that it should be a function of the legislature to approve peacekeeping undertakings by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that was one of the recommendations of the committee that was rejected by the government in its response. I still assert that it is a proper role for parliament to approve the deployment of peacekeeping troops or police or whatever&mdash;a particular response Australia has been called upon to make in the trouble spots of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise to the honourable member for Tangney for not understanding the treaties committee's role in response to defence cooperation, although I certainly believe it is quite appropriate for activities under defence cooperation to be reviewed by the parliament, and also his comments about aid. Perhaps I will have a chance later to catch up with him and get a fuller and better understanding of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a matter of considerable disappointment to me that a request to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) that members of parliament actually go to the recent landmines conference and participate was declined. I found it extraordinarily ironic that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had actually made provisions for members of parliament to be part of the Australian delegation but that no money was forthcoming to facilitate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that members of parliament, as they generally do when they operate in such situations, do bring a very strong bipartisan approach to such deliberations and can make a very constructive and practical contribution to the delegation. I would suggest to the honourable member for Tangney that it is also important that not only the committee be domiciled in the parliament but also from time to time it is appropriate for representatives to actually be at the negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney, unlike his opposition colleagues, did not refer to the opposition amendment to the appropriation for the Attorney-General's Department, which is to decline federal funding to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) for her representation at the Marks royal commission. I found it really ironic listening to many of the contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This royal commission brings up from a number of perspectives an interesting principle&mdash;that is, to what extent people are accountable for what they may or may not have done at another level of government. Clearly, there is no criminality; there is no maladministration. Nothing was done that could bring the minister before the courts. However, she was subject to a royal commission. Carmen Lawrence was the Premier of Western Australia, which is a very high position. Prior to my election to this place, I occupied much more modest positions as an alderman on Blacktown City Council and as deputy mayor of Blacktown City Council. If in some way I had inadvertently misinformed some people about some rate paying action, does that mean that I am accountable for that as a federal member? Does that somehow call into question my fitness to discharge my duties of office? If we start this principle, where do we stop? I think it is a very dangerous principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really need to put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record why the opposition and the Court government are interested in this royal commission. Carmen Lawrence proved to be an outstanding Premier and she has proved to be an outstanding minister in a federal government. If Carmen Lawrence had retired from state parliament, if she had not pursued the position of Leader of the Opposition and chose to stand down, does any member of this House believe that there would have been a royal commission? Absolutely not. This royal commission was concocted for three reasons. The first is that Carmen Lawrence, as a woman, had the temerity not only to be an outstanding minister for health but also to be amongst those considered for future leadership of this party. That seems to have caused offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was really startled by the response of my electorate. I did not put out anything locally. But, spontaneously, ordinary people have rung up my office and said, `Look, the actions of the opposition in blocking the payment of the $243,537 for legal expenses is rubbish. We don't believe it is proper. We have absolute sympathy with Carmen Lawrence. If there's going to be an appeal, will you put $10 down for me and $20 down for my mother-in-law?' That has never happened to me before. My electorate is made up of great people, but they are not on fancy salaries. I am not misleading the House in any way in saying that this has been a spontaneous response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition are trying to say, `Look, we're somehow scoring points,' they are missing the point. A lot of ordinary people and particularly women are taking great offence to this. They know that this royal commission was trumped up. It is not about maladministration, it is not about corruption; it is about a petition that was put to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a serving member on the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, I do not agree with the suppression of names under legislation, which is the way the current act is framed. But this royal commission did not investigate Premier Court's role as Leader of the Opposition in raising questions about the marriage of Penny Easton and the income of Penny Easton's husband. None of that was in the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take great offence to the posturing of opposition members because there is a clear case of criminality in Western Australia; there is a clear case of proven corruption in Western Australia.

The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), one of those Independents, says, `I want a full judicial inquiry; the Liberal Party has to fix up its own act.' But have you ever heard the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, who connived in and concocted the Marks royal commission, say, `This is a matter where we do not have clean hands; it needs to be exorcised, it needs to be investigated and the cancer cut out?' There is one very effective way to do it: by having a royal commission and identifying criminally corrupt members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia&mdash;a member of the state parliament in Western Australia. This corruption goes as far as the state Attorney-General, her husband and campaign funds. They have not asked for any of this. Apparently, this is acceptable Liberal Party behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Mayor of Wanneroo, currently in gaol, a Liberal, a known associate of Crichton-Browne, a known numbers man and fixer in the federal electorate of Moore, wants to give evidence.

Has he raised the issue of this cancer, this corruption, this criminality, in this House? Of course not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To many working Australians reading the headlines of recent days, the Weipa dispute might have seemed to be an affair that was a long way away&mdash;something happening in an isolated mining town or the back of Cape York with no immediate relevance to themselves. But what has been at stake affects not only workers, who were game enough to put themselves on the line against one of the biggest companies in Australia, part of which I think is one of the largest mining conglomerates in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Behind this dispute is the central question of the right of ordinary Australians working in their jobs to collectively organise together to protect and advance their wages and conditions so they can maintain their living standards. The choice, to put it starkly, is between a take it or leave it world&mdash;`sign here or no job'&mdash;and the Australian traditions of arbitration, negotiation and a fair  go. What is at stake here is the capacity of a worker to protect his or her living standards against the might of corporate power. What is at stake here is the capacity to bargain with strength to protect those conditions&mdash;like overtime, penalty rates and sick leave&mdash;that enable a family to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, this has been achieved in Australia through the award system, which is built around conciliation and arbitration and founded on the capacity of workers to negotiate collectively as equals with their employers. More recently it has been done through enterprise bargaining based on an updated award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians must understand that this dispute goes to the core of their capacity to maintain and individually influence their living standards into the 21st century. The company is trying to destroy awards and enterprise bargaining based on the safety net of up-to-date awards protected by an independent referee. It wants a world of individual contracts and when the work force is all signed up to individual contracts the award will be destroyed and workers will have to face the future without the security of awards and unions or a referee. I said in the House on 16 November last year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CRA . . . wants to ensure that bargains are one-sided affairs, putting the might of the company against each individual worker. It wants to collectively bind and gag its work force by ensuring that each individually negotiated contract, in terms of the long-term outcomes, is akin to a boxing contest between an Australian heavyweight champion and a first-time bantamweight. In such a context there can never be a fair contest let alone a bargain involving negotiation. There can be no negotiation or bargaining in the circumstances that CRA is seeking to impose upon its work force.</PARA>
<PARA>Last year when I made that speech I was talking about not only Weipa but also Bell Bay. I also outlined the history of CRA's attacks on awards and the vicious and un-Australian tactics used to undermine the whole of the industrial system, firstly in New Zealand and then at Bell Bay in Tasmania. Now it is Weipa. Here they pretend they are the workers' friend by appearing to be generous to one group of workers while viciously discriminating against those who understand the long-term importance of awards to their Australian living standards and their colleagues who have accepted contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I warned that CRA's attitude would put at risk the significant productivity gains that we have had in recent years and the decade of industrial peace. That has proved to be the case. This week in the AIRC the company's strategy in relation to Weipa has been rejected like it was with Bell Bay. Listening to the statements from the company over the last 24 hours, you have to be sceptical that the company is going to change its ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CRA will certainly be up to its same old tricks either at Weipa or elsewhere in the not too distant future. During the Weipa dispute CRA has boasted that new workers starting are choosing to freely sign contracts. That is like saying that the bank teller with a pistol pointed at his head is choosing of his own free will to hand over the money to a robber. It simply cannot be an even-handed negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new worker at Weipa is like one man against a whole football team. They have levelled the playing field all right so that the whole pack of forwards can run over him. The essence of a CRA type contract is that it provides for no negotiation. It is printed as no change, take it or leave it. Apply the technique outside of Weipa to, say, a nurse seeking a job at one of the nursing home chains or a young shop assistant perhaps signing up at Coles Myer. The fact of the matter is that they do not have equal power to bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Bell Bay and Weipa, Comalco was not interested in taking the path of enterprise bargaining that so many companies have gone along to build productivity in Australia. Right from the start such an option was ruled out. They went for confrontation and not collaboration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing is that it is not just CRA that wants to abolish the award system. It is also the intent of the Liberal and National parties in this House. They are content to work hand in hand with rogue companies like CRA to destroy the basis of our industrial relations system. That is precisely what Richard Court has been doing in Western Australia, what Jeff Kennett has been doing in Victoria and what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) would do nationally if he were elected to power. They are absolutely and completely hostile to the award system and genuine enterprise bargaining based on negotiation and the collective involvement of unions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Wait for the punch line. If we thought there was something wrong with the project, this decision confirmed our worst suspicions. Quite frankly, the Kennett government must go. Members of the federal coalition know but cannot say that Kennett is their biggest problem. His bombastic cadet boy style and his arrogant contempt for any questions that fall off the lips of a docile media pack has even the most gentle people in a state of rage. What the member for Scullin and the member for Melbourne Ports did not say is that the state Labor opposition is not opposed to freeway widening or the imposition of regressive taxes, a petrol tax for example, to fund such freeway building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the member for Scullin, whom I respect, and the member for Melbourne Ports also did not say is that the City Link originated with the state ALP and, in its present form as Melbourne Access 2000, recommends new lanes north of Bell Street, extra lanes south of Brunswick Road and the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway between Bell Street and Brunswick Road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as tolls are concerned, it is worth remembering that Bob Carr, despite all the pre-election claims, did not remove tolls from the M6 once he was elected. It is also worth noting that it has been argued that the ALP's freeway widening policy is substantially unfunded. Surprise, surprise! All of this is a matter for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Melbourne Access 2000 claims to `seek to foster the long-term development of transport access in inner Melbourne in an environmentally sustainable way'. If the ALP wants to be environmentally sound, it should not be widening freeways, a la Jeff Kennett; it should be comprehensively developing public transport. But, of course, it was Peter Batchelor, the ALP spokesperson on public transport, and his mates who wanted to close the Upfield railway line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth pointing out that at a recent meeting at the Brunswick Town Hall a member of the ALP claimed that he would resign from the party rather than support the ALP's Melbourne Access 2000. It is all very well for the state ALP to claim that it is interested in a mix of private and public transport when it did nothing to ensure the survival of the Upfield line and has refused point blank to discuss the federal government's involvement in this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's complicity cannot be hidden. I do not care what Senator Kim Carr says about the matter, because he says basically nothing. I do not care how often he raises the question of environmental safeguards when he is running around Wills as duty senator. The facts are the federal government will provide massive tax breaks for infrastructure bonds raised to build City Link. The facts are that the minister responsible, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), has not said a word about City Link. I have no axe to grind with the member for Scullin, but I cannot say the same for those great deceivers who are running around Melbourne obfuscating the federal government's involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), well knows that I raised this issue with him in February this year and have continued to raise it. What we need to know, however, is exactly what is the federal government's position. As far as I can decipher, the parliamentary secretary is saying that, as long as the City Link does not discriminate against a rapid light rail link to Tullamarine, tax concessions will be granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is true, then as long as the state government allows for a rapid link to the airport the government will cheerfully fund what I understand the member for Scullin and the member for Melbourne Ports regard as a disastrous project. The facts are, however, that we in the north do not want any freeway widening, rapid rail link or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To focus on the processes and the toll is a convenient way of ignoring the bigger issue: that is, just what kind of public transport system we want and just what the state ALP is proposing. But the point is: everyone here says that this City Link is anti-competitive. If it is anti-competitive, the federal government cannot give it a tax break. So the facts are that this cannot receive tax concessions for infrastructure bonds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am happy&mdash;the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) would appreciate this&mdash;and I am smiling now, because I can leave the place knowing that City Link will not be built. The ALP have told me that it is anti-competitive and, if it is anti-competitive, it cannot receive any tax concessions from the Treasurer (Mr Willis). So I will sit down delighted that there will be no City Link in Melbourne, and I can put out a press release because I trust what the member for Melbourne Ports said and what the member for Scullin said today. I regard them as honourable men. I am really happy there will be no City Link because it is anti-competitive. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the current arrangements are clearly in the public benefit. Just as important are the current arrangements which allow newsagents to cover the full range of magazines and overseas publications that may not have a large demand in small retail markets. This provides consumers in areas like Cairns and remote areas of my electorate&mdash;Weipa, Thursday Island, Cooktown, Mossman, Gordonvale and Babinda&mdash;with a wide range of magazines on areas such as the arts, crafts, hobbies, current affairs and sports which would not be available without the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is stating the obvious that supermarkets, petrol stations and convenience stores will not, both for economic reasons and even for space reasons, carry the wide range of publications today available in newsagents all over Australia. If you live in a capital city, no doubt you could seek out some of these specialist magazines in specialist stores, but that does not apply to regions like Cairns&mdash;let alone the smaller townships that I mentioned earlier. To change this, in my view, is not in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to newsagents in my electorate, and they are not afraid of change. They would welcome any outcome which increases competition while maintaining their current range of publications offered and the current affordability of newspaper delivery. Because of the growth in Cairns, I know that they would not be afraid of fair competition as an impediment to their future growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the new considerations of the matter by the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission seems to be that somehow circumstances have materially changed or altered the public interest consideration. The argument runs along the lines that, with the emergence of pay TV and computer-based news, there will be some sort of total decline in newspaper consumption in the very near future. I would suggest that reports of the deaths of newspapers are very premature. Newspapers will, I believe, continue to be a major&mdash;if not the major&mdash;source of informed information and comment for the general public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument is that somehow because general shopping habits have changed, evidenced by extended trading hours, newsagents have become less relevant. I have not noticed, as I travel around my electorate, people leaving their corner newsagencies in droves. Magazines have to be, if you go into supermarkets, placed near the checkout, presumably to induce people to read them as they wait in the queues. This is the only way that they seem to be able to sell those magazines. In my view, this does not constitute a material change. People still use the local family newsagent as a source of information in a wide range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this is totally in the public benefit, and I would suggest that any change would not be of assistance, both to Australia and, in particular, to remote areas. I certainly hope that the family business&mdash;that is, the local newsagent&mdash;will remain providing the same range of publications and the same home delivery services for many years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 February 1995, I spoke in the adjournment debate, and I mentioned then the teleservice centre in my electorate and the concern that constituents were expressing to me. I will quote from that presentation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecentres were originally set up because the DSS found that any DSS officer with a computer could answer a query for a client from any area of the state. The DSS also found that if all telephone queries were directed to a dedicated telecentre it gave local staff more time to deal with people in the office and process their own paperwork.</PARA>
<PARA>Then I went on to say&mdash;and this is the key point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the regions have paid a price for this. The telecentre may have given local staff more time, but it has meant a loss in customer service.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it was no surprise when the National Audit Office revealed today that a great inefficiency exists within the Department of Social Security&mdash;an inefficiency which could have easily been prevented with proper planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these services started in late 1992, the initial target was that a referral to an action officer should be one minute from the initial response in 98 per cent of cases. Failings in relation to this led the target figure to be dropped in 1994 to achieve the standard in 85 per cent of cases. The figure achieved in 1994-95 was, however, only 38 per cent. There we have it from the National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Key findings in the report, apart from the fact that the costs had blown out from $40 million two years ago to $56 million in the 1994-95 year, indicate that there has been an inefficient use of resources as well as a great deterioration in service. The report talks about the inadequate planning and implementation, the lack of flexibility and the lack of integration within the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regional Australia, and particularly in my electorate of Grey, it is of particular concern not only because people have to wait up to 90 minutes on these telecentre services but because they are costly and a great inconvenience. The 140 people employed in the Adelaide telecentre, which got one of the most notable mentions in dispatches, really illustrate how we have gone down the track of centralisation. If we were to put some of these people back into the DSS regional offices in Port Pirie, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Ceduna and use them flexibly and sensibly, we would not only deliver a more cost-effective and efficient service but actually serve the local people much more effectively. If you were to talk to some of the staff within the regional offices you would very quickly come to that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just say to the government: it is there on the record. The National Audit Office has presented it to you. It is time that we looked at delivering effective services to rural and regional areas, and the peak load should be recognised. There should be a more flexible approach and, above all, staff should be taken out of the metropolitan areas and put into the regional centres, providing much needed job opportunities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly about buying Australian made products and supporting Australian owned industries, which I know most people in this place are well aware of, and to refer to a particularly successful business in my electorate known as Paradise Food Industries Pty Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) visited my electorate of Oxley to launch the new Australian Made television advertising campaign. The venue for the launch of the campaign was the Paradise Food Industries factory at Carole Park in my electorate in the state of Queensland. This local company, which was established in 1986 by the Wong brothers&mdash;Tim, Danny and Ted&mdash;is one of a number of highly successful and innovative food manufacturing companies based in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its establishment in 1986, Paradise Food Industries has grown to become one of `Queensland's biscuit kings', producing Cottage Cookies, Kidz Cookies, Snax, crackers and breakfast bars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company is wholly Australian owned and provides employment for more than 200 people in the community. Annual turnover is more than $20 million and over the past three years Paradise Food Industries has achieved record sales growth of approximately 20 per cent a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the performance of this local company and the fact that the Wong family were one of the original licensees under the Australian Made campaign in 1986, both the minister and I thought the company was a great example of what the Australian Made campaign is all about. I am sure a lot of members have seen on television the advertisements, which were launched that day, promoting Australian owned products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paradise Food Industries, very much an Australian owned company, demonstrates the kind of imagination and commitment that is essential for companies of the future. It reflects the attitudes that build strong Australian companies with the confidence and the vision to identify and explore new markets.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is little doubt that Paradise Food Industries has benefited from increased sales as a result of the Australian Made campaign. I offer them my congratulations for their efforts and the records that they have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research indicates that the campaign has created some 6,000 new jobs and boosted gross domestic product by approximately $300 million since it started in 1986. In this context it was great to see the Wong family making their facilities available for a campaign which has had such a positive impact not only in the local region but throughout the nation as a whole. The `Australian Made' logo has struck a patriotic chord in a community which has seen many Australians purchase Australian made goods from Australian companies in an effort to fulfil their campaign's aims of creating jobs, reducing our trade deficit and boosting Australian business. I think it is fair to say that Paradise Food Industries and the Wong family are the epitome of what `Australian Made' is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As outlined earlier in my comments, Paradise Food Industries is one of a number of food manufacturers which are actually located in my electorate and they have had the drive to expand out of the local market into the national marketplace and from there into the competitive international marketplace. We have seen some biscuit companies in Australia. A lot of people eat biscuits. Unfortunately, some companies have been purchased by overseas investors and their profits have gone off-shore. This particular company, Paradise Food Industries, is really doing a great job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly makes you more conscious when you go into the shopping centres and look at the various products. I do take the opportunity from time to time to go shopping with my wife for that very reason&mdash;to keep in touch with the prices and things like that. My wife does not particularly like me doing it because she reckons I buy all the wrong things. It certainly made me rather conscious of this local business, Paradise Food Industries, when I saw their products on the shelves and became very conscious of that company. Perhaps we need to become more aware of the value of buying Australian and making sure that those particular items are marked on the shelves in our stores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I offer my congratulations to the Wong family and to all the employees at Paradise Food Industries for their commitment and the work that they are doing in promoting Australian made products.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House answers to questions on notice, which confirm the grievous inadequacies in the government's telecommunications regime. I object to the Australian people, in particular, the people of my electorate, being used as guinea pigs in this government's crazy experiment with open slather in telecommunications. Answer to question No. 2586 from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Telecommunications National Code carriers are required to co-locate towers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. Then he added the escape hatch:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unless it is not technically feasible.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that as at September 1995 the carriers had co-located at around 135 sites.</PARA>
<PARA>It sounds impressive until we realise that there are 2,000 of these mobile phone base stations and 135 co-locations means that at less than seven per cent of sites co-location is taking place. In other words, this government sets a rule which sounds good and then it puts in an exception which makes a complete mockery of the rule. The same answer goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEST&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has advised that it considers the possible co-location of mobile base station facilities as part of its assessment process.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that there has been one case . . . where after AUSTEL intervention, the carriers involved agreed to co-locate.</PARA>
<PARA>There are 2,000 of these base stations right around the country and there is one case where co-location has taken place after regulatory intervention. It is a complete and absolute joke. It is a fraud and a mockery of the Australian people. In answer to question No. 2373 the minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to deliver pay television services by cable on power poles is one for the carriers, subject to the . . . Telecommunications National Code.</PARA>
<PARA>Austel has advised Ku-ring-gai council that the carriers do not have any right whatsoever to appeal to DEST under the telecommunications national code. It is a complete joke and a fraud, yet this minister has the hide to go around claiming that there is some adequate system of regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same answer the minister pointed out, admitted, that Telstra would be putting 20 per cent of its pay TV cable overhead on power poles. Yet he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as the majority of Telstra's cabling will be underground it seems unlikely that there will be many areas where Optus and Telstra will both have cables mounted on power poles.</PARA>
<PARA>Because it is 20 per cent, because it is one street in five throughout Australia, the minister thinks it does not matter. But it is one street in five that will have not just one cable the thickness of a 20c piece but two; one street in five that will have not just one splitter box per power pole the size of a video cassette but two; and one street in five that will have not just one signal amplifier the size of a briefcase every few hundred yards but two. It is as though the minister is saying, `Well, something is happening in only Penrith, Liverpool and Blacktown; it is not happening in the rest of Sydney, therefore it does not matter.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another answer, this time to question No. 2372, the minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Code specifically provides a role for local councils to receive full details of the carriers' proposed activities to enable affected communities to be consulted.</PARA>
<PARA>Consultation does not happen. Dictation is what is happening. The carriers do not ask permission; they tell people what is happening. They do not ask, `Can we do it?' They say, `This is what we are going to do, and you can like it or lump it.' The minister should come in here and admit that the information superhighway risks becoming a dead end of poles and wires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We currently have 2,000 of these base stations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk briefly on royal commissions, Senator Crichton-Browne and other things. In my view, royal commissions are always set up by governments with an end in view. It is quite clear that royal commissions do not follow the rules of evidence and are open to political use. It has been alleged that the recent Marks royal commission was guilty of procedural unfairness. That may be so. However, what I can say is that the royal commission into Western Australian government activities was clearly totally unprincipled and totally without any procedural fairness at all. It took realms and realms of secret evidence that we will not know the details of for 30 years. That evidence was clearly used to colour the decisions that were arrived at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and principal conclusion of that $30 million exercise, after looking under every stone conceivable, was that there was no corruption in the Western Australian government. That was the finding of that royal commission. However, as a result of that, a premier and a minister went to gaol. The minister's sentence was overturned on appeal. If anyone looks at the facts in respect of Brian Burke, they will see that it was an outrageous decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper was absolutely without principle at that time. It attended the royal commission and reported it in lurid detail. These people were tried and convicted, in my view, by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. This lack of balance has also been shown by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> in respect of Crichton-Browne. I have had dealings with Crichton-Browne over many years. He was, without a doubt, the most successful secretary of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. Under Crichton-Browne's leadership, the Liberal Party won every seat north of Geraldton. We did not hold one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a strategy put in place by state member Julian Grill and me that won every one of those seats back from Crichton-Browne. He was, in my view, a formidable opponent. The fact that we hold those seats now is often not recognised by people in the Labor Party, who think we have always held them. It is one of the failings caused by some people's lack of history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found Crichton-Browne to be an extremely good chairman. Anyone who has had anything to do with committees would acknowledge that he is a very good chairman. He usually knows what he is talking about. He goes to some trouble to get the facts. He is certainly a listener; he listens to what people are saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other unusual thing about Crichton-Browne is that he keeps his word. That is more than I think can be said for the grubby lot in the Western Australian Liberal Party who have been pursuing him. If I had to choose a partner in any venture, I would rather have Crichton-Browne than the sleaze-bags of Chaney, Viner et al who have pursued him so vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> has jumped on this crusade I think is simply a reflection of the lack of balance that we get from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> from time to time. I think they really ought to review their procedures. I wrote a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> saying basically that, and it was never published&mdash;but I guess that is what is to be expected from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time that people in Australia took a very hard look at what is happening. In Western Australia we have seen the Department of Public Prosecutions, set up by the incumbent Labor government and in fact appointed by the then Premier, Carmen Lawrence, operating on the basis that is, as judges have recently said, in danger of perverting the course of justice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some four weeks ago a new lobby group emerged in Sydney concerning the Sydney airport noise problems. The group styled the Sydney Airport Forum is certainly no ordinary protest group. It was announced that the forum would raise up to $1 million and was headed by a high-powered group from the lower North Shore. A spokesman indicated that the forum would use its resources to initiate legal action, undertake detailed technical research and devise advertising campaigns.</PARA></TALK.START>

It seems remarkable that newspaper reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> contained little critical analysis of the group. The line was taken that here was a new positive development which would make up for the generally flagging and ineffectual efforts of the community based anti-noise groups to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stated aim of the Sydney Airport Forum is to ensure that `all sensible solutions are evaluated in a fair and open and non-political manner'. Motherhood statements like this are meaningless, but in fact the fine print states that the forum will `endeavour to promote a solution to the noise issues before local resident action groups take direct action towards the tourism and airline industries', and that starts to let the cat out of the bag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allied to the fact that the forum is headed by a director of the Sydney Tourism Task Force, an organisation which was one of the arch proponents of the third runway, makes a compelling case that the Sydney Airport Forum is in effect a front organisation to minimise the problems of the airline and tourism industries and minimise impediments to their growth at the airport. It is not surprising that, given the avalanche of propaganda for the construction of a third runway by business groups, it has taken this long for a front organisation for the continued expansion of the airport to be formed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sydney Airport Forum, with a few gullible acolytes, can take its place along with other industry fronts such as the Forest Protection Society, representing loggers and woodchippers; the Litter Research Association; and the Keep Australia Beautiful Society, representing the producers of waste. The forum indicates that its considerable funds will be used prior to the next federal election. Given the fact that the forum's members are overwhelmingly right-wing and given its denigration of other airport protest groups such as the No Aircraft Noise Party, anyone who did not come down in the last political shower would have to conclude there is a good chance of a brace of dummy Independents coming on, at least in the seat of Bennelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's policy is to expand Sydney airport, concentrate the noise on the minimum number of voters but minimise the effect on right-wing Labor members. The Liberal Party's policy is to expand Sydney airport, disperse the noise on the maximum number of voters but minimise the effect on Liberal members. The Sydney Airport Forum's policy is to expand Sydney airport, spread the noise anywhere except Hunters Hill but minimise the effect on the tourism and airline industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday evening at Red Hill in Canberra, an Australian Federal Police officer shot dead Mr Warren I'Anson, a person with schizophrenia. This was the latest in a highly disturbing number of shootings by police of people with a mental illness. Most of these incidents in recent times have occurred in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This incident was a tragedy and the circumstances are particularly appalling. Mr I'Anson himself was an active volunteer worker in the mental health sector and assisted many other people with a mental illness. His own support worker suggested to him last Thursday that he seek voluntary admission to hospital only 24 hours before his death. I understand she was told by the ACT mental health crisis team that there were no beds available. Apparently, the police were called on Friday and forced their way into Mr I'Anson's home, where he was fatally shot within 45 minutes. There was no attempt to call Mr I'Anson's family or friends for assistance in the period before his death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing this issue tonight, I do not wish to lay the blame for this tragedy at any individual police officer or any other person. Certainly, one could suggest that there may be a cultural problem with the police in Victoria, where incidents of this nature have sadly been commonplace. But any blame for these incidents does not necessarily lie with the police, who in many cases should not have been put in the position they were in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe what these incidents highlight is the failure of state and territory governments not only to properly implement the national mental health strategy but also to provide basic mental health services. Indeed, there is evidence that funding and services in mental health are being cut in some states and territories. In my role as chair of the caucus mental health working group, I have spoken to dozens of people across Australia&mdash;including consumers, carers and service providers&mdash;and have heard continuing horror stories about the lack of services and cuts to services by state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most frequent question I am asked by these people is: what can I do or what can we do as a federal government to monitor the states and to ensure that the states and territories are doing the right thing? This is a particular problem in Victoria and South Australia. We have heard previously from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) about the way the Kennett government takes money out of the health budget in Victoria faster than the Commonwealth can put it in. In South Australia, the South Australian Mental Health Services has been abolished and absorbed into the South Australian Health Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The reason that this federal government initiated the national mental health strategy in 1992, under then Minister Brian Howe, was that mental health, like Aboriginal health, had traditionally been a state responsibility but had been badly neglected. This government believed mental health to be a basic social justice issue and, accordingly, sought to increase the Commonwealth's role. The Burdekin report, presented in October 1993, was further evidence of the inadequacy of mental health services, and this resulted in the federal government's commitment of $269 million over four years to the national mental health strategy, announced in the May 1994 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the mental health community has the right to ask: where is this money going if people still cannot get basic services and if people are being shot by police? Many groups are now calling for a royal commission into the deaths by shooting of so many people. I certainly believe that an inquiry of some kind should be held and that its terms of reference should include an investigation into the levels of services provided by state and territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this subject, however, I am pleased to point out that today the Minister for Human Services and Health has written to all state and territory health ministers seeking their views on the formation of a task force to look at these incidents involving people with mental illness in crisis. The suggestion will be made that those health ministers involve their police ministers. The minister has also written to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr)&mdash;another minister who is very interested in social justice&mdash;about this issue. So there are signs that this federal government will make a responsible and quick response to the tragedies of so many people being shot by police&mdash;police who should not have been called in the first place&mdash;and to these issues of people with mental illness in crisis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak this evening about the Ballarat Technology Park and the ISSC Southern Region Data Centre. This coming Friday, 24 November, the Premier of Victoria, the Hon. Jeff Kennett, will officially open the Ballarat Technology Park and the ISSC Southern Region Data Centre in my electorate of Ballarat. At the same time, the Victorian Minister for Health, the Hon. Maree Tehan, will announce the western Victorian telemedicine project&mdash;a project to enable western Victorian hospitals to consult specialist radiologists and pathologists in Ballarat and Melbourne on a 24 hour a day, seven day a week basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both these events are major achievements for Ballarat and the region. The Victorian government has been actively involved and I should acknowledge its commitment to meeting the challenges of the information age under the agenda 21 project, which has enabled country Victoria to take up the many innovative opportunities of the information age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ballarat Technology Park, on the campus of the University of Ballarat, comprises nearly 29 hectares fronting onto Geelong Road. It was officially launched in February 1995 by Victorian regional development minister, Roger Hallam. The development of the Ballarat Technology Park has involved a partnership with the city of Ballarat, the initial project being the ISSC Southern Region Data Centre&mdash;a $14 million building development at the Ballarat Technology Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building project has been constructed by local building contractor H. Troon Pty Ltd. The building of the single- and two-storey construction will provide 200 workstations and a sophisticated computer environment in an airconditioned building. The area will be landscaped to fit with the local environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first tenant of the Ballarat Technology Park is an IBM-Lend Lease joint venture, ISSC Australia, which will provide computer outsourcing facilities on a commercial basis for clients in Australia and Asia operating from the new Southern Region Data Centre. The provision of Vic Roads and the Public Transport Commission outsourcing facilities in the Ballarat region is the core of this new development. Other ISSC clients to be served at the Ballarat Technology Park include Lend Lease, Cathay Pacific, the SECV and a $50 million project to supply computing services to the Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">IBM intends to invest up to $90 million in the next five years to operate the centre at Ballarat. The company has funded a chair in information technology at the University of Ballarat and will provide up to 20 scholarships and 10 traineeships. IBM will develop research links with the university and the institution will be able to tap into IBM's global facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The University of Ballarat is at the forefront of providing the skills necessary for the new information age. They have structured their computing degree to ensure that students develop lifelong learning and generic skills over and above the traditional discipline skills of a computer specialist. They are attempting to develop IT specialists with the interpersonal skills to enable them to communicate with the rest of us mere mortals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Collaboration between the University of Ballarat and the Ballarat Technology Park will enable the university to build IT elements into many of its courses and enhance graduate employability. In the information age, companies to be globally competitive will need to derive advantage from working smarter, using the computer as a cognitive tool. Tomorrow's graduates will need a synergistic interweaving of traditional disciplines and IT knowledge and skills. The University of Ballarat has responded to the challenge by making it possible for students to interweave the study of IT with their chosen course and complete a double degree in four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ISSC site at Ballarat is expected to employ about 350 people within three years. IT related industries are anticipated to employ over 3,000 people within the region within five years. </PARA>

We are justifiably proud of the University of Ballarat. Under the stewardship of Vice-Chancellor David James the university is at the cutting edge of IT development and has formed a close partnership with the community. The staff at the university are to be congratulated for their pro-active approach and commitment to this extraordinarily exciting development. </PARA>

It appalls me that an elected representative of the people can abuse the rights of public office in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suburb of Ravenswood was originally built as a housing division.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ravenswood residents have every right to be outraged, as is shown in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS> newspaper today. Narelle Cameron of the Ravenswood Primary School P&amp;F said that everyone in Ravenswood is not a `no-hoper' and that in fact, although many of them are unemployed often through no fault of their own, many are also in work. Nobody&mdash;and I repeat nobody&mdash;deserves the verbal abuse offered by George Brookes on Monday of this week.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After five years of ACT Labor government the agreement was not signed.

I take this opportunity to call on the new ACT Liberal government to sign the agreement and confirm the commitment of the people of the Australian Capital Territory to their environment, and confirm that the people of the ACT are willing to carry their share of their environmental responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of the ACT showed their support for our waterways during National Water Week this year through a festival that is run in my electorate called Aquafest 95.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Aquafest was launched at Lake Tuggeranong College and was run in conjunction with the National Water Week. The theme for National Water Week this year was `protect, conserve and get involved'. National Water Week was to focus all Australians' attention on ways in which to protect our waterways, as well as encouraging all of us to reduce our water usage. It was also about encouraging all of us to become more involved in maintaining and improving our water quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many practical suggestions, such as using low phosphorus washing powders because phosphorus contributes to blue-green algae. It was suggested that we use less washing powder and only wash when there is a full load. It also suggested things like washing the car on the lawn so that the soapy water did not get into our waterways and disposing of food scraps and any oils properly to keep them out of our waterways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highlight of National Water Week in the ACT was Aquafest 95.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Water is a prominent feature in the Tuggeranong Valley, with the Murrumbidgee River flowing through the valley and the ACT. Many of my constituents have enjoyed, as I have, the recreation spots on the river like Pine Island and Point Hut. Indeed, the city of Canberra is the largest population centre in the Murray-Darling Basin. I find it extraordinary that we are not a signatory to the Murray-Darling agreement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other prominent reminder for all of us in the valley is Lake Tuggeranong.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I mentioned today in a personal explanation following question time, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper there were some comments about me by a former mayor, now gaolbird, Dr Wayne Bradshaw. He used to be the mayor of the city of Wanneroo and had considerable power in the Liberal Party structure in the northern suburbs. Dr Bradshaw said that I had approached him and sought his support; he had rejected it because he thought I was not a very good candidate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These particular assertions made in the Kyle hearings going on at present are absolutely absurd. According to this particular sequence of events, I would have just beaten Dr Bradshaw as the candidate for Moore in 1989. In actual fact, the words he used in the inquiry are very telling. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seven years of living in Wanneroo, he wasn't a member of one community activity, so I thought that ruled him out to be a suitable politician.</PARA>
<PARA>In the council minutes for October 1990, then Councillor Bradshaw said the following in relation to a council debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, I consider Paul Filing personally anti-Wanneroo. To the best of my knowledge he has lived here for six or seven years in Wanneroo and has not been a member of one organisation in Wanneroo. I am personally yet to see him do one thing that has benefited Wanneroo.</PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting because that particular debate arose from the fact that Dr Bradshaw&mdash;who, at the time was a Liberal Party branch president as well as being mayor&mdash;had banned me, the sitting Liberal federal member for the area, from attending council functions, including citizenship ceremonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had actually written to him, asking that he reconsider that ban as a matter of urgency or I would take up the matter in this place with the minister for immigration because I considered that he was overstepping his delegated powers as the mayor in granting citizenship.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to continue from the shadow minister's comments of last evening. It is with some gratitude that I lived some 20 years ago, in terms of coming out of school and being able to readily access work. I guess that, at that time, I took that for granted. It has been a constant theme in recent years, over the last decade or so, that youth unemployment has been one of the great issues facing our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 2) 1995 picks up some of those issues. The shadow minister made a range of comments; it is, of course, the role of the opposition to draw out the weaknesses in the current program. In my comments this morning, I will just touch on those issues which are particularly of my own experience within my own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of regional unemployment is just that much more acute, because of the lack of opportunities for access to education and for access to stable employment. There just is not the choice there. It has been part of my role as a member, in the last 2 1/2 years, to bring to the attention of the parliament those extra and additional burdens which have come from the way that our nation has evolved over recent decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing these regional issues, I want to touch on at least three categories: those people living in the cities, those people living in the smaller and more remote communities, and those Aboriginal people who find it that much more difficult than their urban friends do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the regional cities&mdash;as Professor Gregory, I think, has outlined in his analysis&mdash;we are getting pockets of second and third generation unemployment. Whilst there has been some effort to bring universities out to the region, in the case of, say, Whyalla, the choice&mdash;as everyone would agree&mdash;is nowhere near as good or as available. The cost of students having to go to the cities&mdash;that is, the metropolitan areas&mdash;is quite extraordinary and is something that is not often enough recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that there is a greater incentive, in purely financial terms, to be on unemployment benefits than to, for example, have access to Austudy is an issue that is constantly raised with me, because, in the regions, the costs are much greater. Whilst the parliament does offer to young people the living away from home allowance&mdash;something like $40&mdash;it comes nowhere near recognising that added cost. That is just briefly touching on the regional city situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people living in the more isolated communities&mdash;the country towns and the wheat and sheep belt areas&mdash;do not have that fundamental choice of secondary education. This problem is insufficiently recognised. The cost factors are the same as those I have previously mentioned for the regional cities. The living away from home allowance goes nowhere near acknowledging those factors, let alone the destabilisation of home life when people have to go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is of particular significance to the Aboriginal people in the difficulties that they face. We all understand that the literacy and numeracy levels of their young people are, in many cases, not sufficient to enable them to go on to secondary or tertiary education. I acknowledge the efforts of the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), in regard to Abstudy. When I was in the Pitjantjatjara lands only last week, it was acknowledged and appreciated that some effort had been made towards the simplification of form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In touching on other issues, I will pick up some of the themes from the shadow minister's comments last night. In the last 13 years there have been approximately 50 labour market programs initiated by this government. We still have the entrenched reality of unemployment. We are getting used to the fact that, as we come out of each recessionary cycle, long-term unemployment is ratcheting up. If it was six per cent in the last cycle, it is eight per cent in this cycle. That pattern continues, and the numbers of our long-term unemployed are increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be a different approach if we are going to break the back of this issue. The recent Yellow Pages small business index survey gives us one signpost that we as a nation must heed&mdash;that small business believes that there are far too many hurdles for them to make a contribution to breaking the back of unemployment. There are some huge issues in the culture, and in the attitude of government and the parliament, which can improve and enhance the role of small business. After all, in the last decade small business has provided 870,000 new jobs, despite all the hurdles that are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I offer those comments as a positive contribution. Labour market programs have their place, but if we see evidence of long-term unemployment ratcheting up there have to be new and innovative programs developed. Such programs should begin a sustained attack on unemployment and bring it down with the aim of creating long-term stable jobs, not simply recycling people from long-term unemployment back into short-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks on this theme by referring to the amendment to the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Youth Training Allowance) Bill (No. 3) which will be moved by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). It will state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the House condemns the failure of the government's measures to assist young unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA>Wherever you are in the political spectrum, I do not think that anyone is suggesting that people are deliberately creating programs which are not intended to improve the situation. But we do have a culture which does not harness all the tools that we have as a nation. Whilst this bill rearranges the deckchairs a little, the fundamental issue is one of involving small business, and of recognising that all Australians, whatever their political beliefs, have that basic desire to have, wherever possible, security and long-term stability of employment. If we do not get that balance right in our economy, we, as a parliament, have not contributed as well as we should have to the wellbeing of our nation . </PARA>

Secondary participation has increased from around one in three going on to year 12 when the government came to office to around three out of every four going on to year 12 now. Commonwealth growth funding for the TAFE and training sector has also seen participation increase in that sector and the higher education undergraduate population has increased by over 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has happened because young people these days need additional skills to be able to enter the work force. The kinds of unskilled jobs that were available to 15- to 19-year-olds, particularly the 15-year-old school leavers, have simply disappeared. To enter the work force in the 1990s, young people require more than a basic year 10 level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those 15- to 19-year-olds who do remain in the work force, a high percentage are unemployed. A smaller number are in the work force, but of those a high percentage are unemployed; and this is a fact which seems to have escaped, among others, the honourable member for Goldstein. The honourable member for Goldstein referred to comments made by certain media proprietors, Messrs Packer and Murdoch, on the same subject. I think that they also failed to grasp that the percentage teenage unemployment rate refers to a diminishing number of young people from ages 15 to 19 in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate the point, one might imagine a situation where the government in the future has been extremely successful and overshot the Finn targets which aim to have 95 per cent of this age group completing year 12 or a similar qualification by the year 2001. One might imagine a situation where we had exceeded that target to a point where there was only one teenager not in further education or training, only one teenager in the labour market, one teenager finding himself or herself unemployed. Of course, the statistical rate of teenage unemployment in that case would be 100 per cent but it would refer simply to one individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the treatment of statistics, I think the honourable member for Goldstein has a lot to learn and the media proprietors to whom he referred also have a lot to learn. On that topic I simply express the hope that Messrs Packer and Murdoch know a bit more about Rugby League than they do about statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also correct a remark made by the honourable member for Goldstein in dealing with apprenticeships and traineeships, and again I refer to the numbers. It is true that the government has been very successful during its period in office in seeing the labour force grow. The labour force has increased by around 25 per cent, from some 6 1/2 million to around 8 million. At the same time, the number of apprentices and trainees commencing has also increased. The opposition should be aware that, when they left office, apprenticeship and traineeship commencements were of the order of 35,000. In the latest year they numbered some 70,000. So we have doubled the performance that was registered under the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, 88,000 young people unemployed is still too many and I endorse what the honourable member for Goldstein said about youth unemployment tending to concentrate in particular regions. That is why the government has adopted a structure of area consultative committees along with the case management regime to ensure that the attack on unemployment, particularly on youth unemployment, is concentrated in those regions where greatest assistance is needed. I thank those who participated in the debate. I commend the bill to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Changes to the Austudy/Abstudy supplement scheme</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austudy/Abstudy supplement scheme is a loan scheme under which tertiary students can forgo part or all of their Austudy or Abstudy benefits, up to a maximum of $3,500 a year, for an interest-free loan of twice the amount of benefits forgone, that is, up to $7,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students who have already received Austudy or Abstudy at the time of application may maximise the amount of supplement they are able to receive by forgoing some or all of those benefits previously paid. However, under the existing arrangements this must be done by specified cut-off dates of 31 May, for benefits received during the period from 1 January to 31 May, or 30 September, for benefits received during the period from 1 July to 30 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes to abolish these cut-off dates so that students can trade Austudy or Abstudy benefits at any time before the end of their eligibility period. The student, therefore, will be able to take the maximum amount of supplement to which he or she is entitled at a time of their own choosing. This will mean that a student who applies late in the eligibility period will be able to obtain a greater amount of supplement than under the existing arrangements. The amendments will take effect from 1 January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supplement loans are also available to a second category of students. Dependent tertiary students who meet all the criteria for Austudy or Abstudy apart from the parental income test are able to obtain a loan of up to $2,000 a year if their parents' adjusted income is under $50,850. Only a small number of students have chosen to take up this option. The government has decided, therefore, that, from 1 January 1996, loans for students from families with parental income above the Austudy or Abstudy limits will no longer be available. This is consistent with the government's commitment to target assistance to those in greatest need. The bill includes amendments to give effect to this decision. Students from low income families who are eligible for Austudy or Abstudy will not be affected by this change. These students will continue to have access to supplement loans of up to $7,000 a year. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently a person who is in receipt of benefits under the act is obliged to tell the department, within seven days of their occurrence, of certain events that may affect the level of benefit being paid. In some circumstances, a failure to do so could lead to a person being imprisoned for up to 12 months. The government has decided to increase the amount of time a person has to tell the department of such events from seven to 14 days. It has also decided to remove the criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it still remains important that the department becomes aware of changes in the circumstances of a person receiving a benefit, because it could mean that a person is receiving more benefit than the legal entitlement. Therefore, in place of the criminal sanction, the bill inserts a provision that makes a person liable for a penalty of $10 for each week, or part of a week, up to a maximum of $1,000 where a person fails to inform the department within 14 days of an event which affects eligibility. Failure to notify changes in circumstances is now the most significant factor contributing to the size of student assistance debt. It is hoped that this change will encourage the earlier reporting of changes and will ultimately reduce the level of student indebtedness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am certainly not aware of these amendments. It is, I have to say for the record, all too typical of the legislation that has come through from this department that a bill is no sooner introduced than it is amended. You get the impression that this is a government which is simply trying to think on the run in putting forward legislation. It knew that there was a possibility of an election towards the end of this year, which the govenment has now backed away from; yet it has rushed legislation in without, once again, thinking it through. Of course, the monumental example of the unthought-through government measure was Working Nation, which took something like a year to invent after the initial announcements were made without any of the supporting detail for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now got what one would suppose would normally be a straightforward piece of legislation coming before the parliament, and before it is even here it is amended. This is a government that seems unable to undertake even the simplest of tasks without making a welter of them. Of course, it means that, because it cannot get its own act together, it is unable to provide the opposition with adequate courtesies in terms of the handling and treatment of this legislation. I do not consider it at all satisfactory that amendments should be made available to the opposition, as I understand from the government that they have been, only hours before the bill is introduced into the parliament. It is quite unsatisfactory that quite substantial amendments&mdash;as I see from the sheets of paper that have just been presented to me&mdash;are now to be made to the legislation without the opposition having had adequate time to consider them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation amends the Student Assistance Act 1973 to make changes to Austudy which were foreshadowed in the May budget. The bill contains two significant amendments and a number of minor changes. The changes having been foreshadowed in the budget, one would have thought that this legislation could have been brought before the parliament considerably earlier than November; there has been an extraordinary timelag in the bringing forward of this piece of legislation. It has now been brought forward at the death knock of this year's parliamentary sittings, and, even now, the government cannot get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation proposes to replace family payments for 16- and 17-year-old secondary students with a new student payment, and to restrict entitlement to Austudy to Australian citizens. Some other amendments relate to the elimination of Austudy category 2 loans, changes to category 1 loans, the imposition of a fine for failure to notify change of circumstance, and the removal of the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major changes to the bill are contained in schedules 3, 5 and 6. Schedule 3 of the bill restricts Austudy to Australian citizens. In 1994, approximately 47,000 permanent residents received Austudy benefits. Letters have been sent to such people by DEET, informing them of the requirement for them to become citizens to remain eligible for Austudy. This measure has been presented by the government as a tighter targeting measure which will prevent rorting of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schedule mirrors an amendment to HECS, the higher education contribution scheme. In relation to that amendment, the coalition foreshadowed an amendment which would restrict the government's proposals to persons who would take out permanent residency and commence studies from 1 January 1996. HECS is different from Austudy in that it is a loan, while Austudy is a direct payment involving considerable moneys and ought, in the first instance, to be directed to Australian citizens. The restriction of Austudy to Australian citizens is expected to provide savings of $10.34 million in 1995-96, $19.93 million in 1996-97, $20.65 million in 1997-98 and $21.43 million in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedules 5 and 6 are related amendments. Schedule 6 abolishes family payment for any person over 16 years of age. Schedule 5 establishes a new basic student payment. These amendments represent a shift in the philosophical justification for financial assistance to 16-year-olds and over. The justification for schedules 5 and 6 is that any financial assistance for children 16 years and over ought to be targeted to support their engagement in full-time study or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assumption underlying this has to be questioned. The government's blithe assumption that, somehow or other, anyone receiving assistance who is over the age of 16 years is going to be engaged in full-time study or training is not an accurate one. Whatever the government may desire to be the case, that is not an accurate assumption. There are many young people in that position who wish to be in employment&mdash;either full-time employment in the workplace or part-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of these amendments is that families will be worse off. We have heard a great deal of noise from this government about how much it cares for families and looks after those families most in need. What we have before us is yet another piece of evidence of the disregard of the interests of Australian families, particularly those who are most disadvantaged. It is clear that this legislation is something of an embarrassment to the government. The minister has come in here to read a speech which the department has prepared for him and which he has delivered in his usual impassioned style. But no-one else from the government is around to clearly support and argue for this piece of legislation, lest they be seen, I suppose, to participate in this further damage done to Australian families, because the net effect of the legislation, as I have said, is that families will be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current family payment is more generous than the proposed student payment, and the means test which is being imposed on this benefit is more stringent than that which used to apply to the family payment. The new student payment, as I understand it, will consist of a lump sum payment of $500 per year to be paid in two instalments. There will be no graduation of the student payment according to the level of income. Persons on low incomes will be able to apply for Austudy in addition to the basic student payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current family payment is $564 a year&mdash;$64 more than proposed for this payment. Families at present who are on low incomes can apply for either Austudy or additional family payment. The means test for the new basic student payment at this stage seems to be more stringent than that which applies to family payment. Eligibility for student payment will be subject to `means testing arrangements that are similar to Austudy'&mdash;those are the words that are used. The exact details of the means test are yet to be defined. As seems more and more usual under Labor, we are debating legislation with dubious substance, the details of which are yet to be determined. And, as we have seen, the government still has further details to put before us which it has just thought of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current family payment assets test threshold is $584,500. Under Austudy the assets test threshold is $393,750. In addition, the family payment test has hardship provisions which allow for circumstances where families have high asset value but no or low income. Austudy has no such provisions. This has been the cause of constant complaints from rural communities that, despite low income, their asset value excludes them from being eligible for Austudy. The replacement of the family payment system with student payment is estimated to provide savings of $19.69 million in 1996-97, $19.21 million in 1997-98 and $19.03 million in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that these new measures are advantageous in that families no longer need to deal with both DEET and the Department of Social Security, but will now fall under the umbrella of DEET alone. Whether families will welcome falling under the Department of Employment, Education and Training is a significant question that families may like to ask themselves when they look at the consequences of the policies pursued by this department, and its horrendous size. Being under this department could be quite a crushing burden for many families to carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other changes which the bill makes are relatively minor. Schedule 1 relates to category 1 loans. These loans enable students on Austudy to trade in part of their payment for a loan double the amount traded. This schedule removes the possibility of combining broken periods of eligibility in applying for the loan, but enables students to take up a loan at any time of the year. It also removes the cut-off date for repayment of such loans. This last amendment is expected to provide savings of $6 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 of the legislation abolishes Austudy category 2 loans. These loans are for students who would be eligible for Austudy payments but are excluded by the means test. Such students could take out interest free loans of up to $2,000. The government has decided to do away with these loans, as the demand for them was not as great as expected. Apparently, only about 4,000 to 5,000 students took up this option, although the department estimated that some 11,000 to 15,000 students would avail themselves of these loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an important question to be asked about the nature of the students who took out these loans. My recollection is that this measure was introduced to be of specific benefit to rural students. Indeed, it was recommended by the Chapman inquiry that loans be made more freely available so that students who might be eligible for Austudy payments but for the assets tests could avail themselves of loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be valuable for the government to provide information as to whether or not the 4,000 to 5,000 students who took out these loans were distinctively rural students. Indeed, that raises the question of whether or not the abolition of these loans will be of particular disadvantage to rural students. If that is so, this will be just another example of rural Australia and farming families struggling to make a go of it under the mismanagement of the country&mdash;another blow to these families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that this measure will provide savings, which will be only $760,000 in 1995-96, $2.7 million in 1996-97, and $3.13 million in 1997-98. There is a question about this measure and I would appreciate it if the minister, in his response, could provide to the parliament some information about the nature of the students who will be excluded from loans by this particular savings measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I do find it a quite extraordinary justification for cutting out a measure that fewer have used it than the department anticipated. Presumably, it was of great value to these 4,000 to 5,000 students&mdash;not an inconsiderable number. They needed these loans&mdash;and they were only loans. It is not as if the government has been hit with expenditure in this area that was much greater than expected. It is not as if we are facing a major blow-out here. In fact, the expenditures are not great and, presumably, the measure was of value to these students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 of the bill abolishes the Austudy and Abstudy dependent spouse allowances. Spouses will be able to apply for the parenting allowance which commenced in July this year. This particular change has no financial implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 7 imposes a $10 weekly fine for failing to notify the department of a change in circumstances which may affect eligibility for Austudy. It is anticipated that this measure will generate revenue of $3 million in 1996-97, and another $2.5 million in identification of overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 8 clarifies the application of the parental income test in the case of persons in state or foster care. Schedule 9 of the bill gives the secretary greater discretion in negotiating the collection of debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all remember, 1994 was the International Year of the Family. The silence coming from the government in relation to this year has been deafening. It seems that we have, in this legislation, further evidence that the government does not have families clearly in its focus, because it is restricting eligibility for family payments and actually reducing access to assistance for families who need it. </PARA>

Working Nation is supposed to be in operation fully now, yet we find youth unemployment 29 per cent higher than it was when Working Nation was introduced. We have the most appalling performance from this government on a matter which is of fundamental importance to families.

It is a fight which she is probably losing despite the bravado we are seeing at the present time. Frankly, the government cannot sustain the continued presence on the front bench of this minister, who now has no public credibility whatsoever.

I do not think anybody, when they look at the record of this government, could believe for a moment that they have had the interests of Australian families at heart, or the interests of the young people of those families. If they had then we would not now be facing these appalling conditions where, as I have said, youth unemployment is higher than it was when Working Nation came down. </PARA>

They are trying to get some effective assistance to become, once more, full participating members of this society. We have the highest rate of youth suicide in the world, and unemployment is clearly a very significant contributor to that, especially for young people in rural areas. Here we see the government bringing before this parliament a piece of legislation which makes a virtue of the fact that it is cutting out educational loans to these young people.

And what is the reality? The reality is that we have the lowest number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force for three decades. What an abysmal failure. Why has this come about? Why has there been this loss of focus, why has there been this betrayal of young Australians? It is because the government has not had its eye fixed on the ball. It has had its eye fixed on one priority only, and that is how it can preserve the interests of its mates in the ACTU. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister for employment, training and family services, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has very well stated the general backdrop to training and unemployment and the various issues. The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill is a budget measure, and I want to touch on some of those government decisions over the last three years which impact on students. All governments like to be the bearers of good news and the irony of this, of course, is that there are some budget savings. We have heard about the loan withdrawal, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us think about the tax increase and impact on the cost of living for students: wholesale sales tax on food, rent, repairs, clothes, the whole lot. In one bound, the government puts great hurdles in front of young people struggling with their increasing costs. In regional areas, there is fuel excise, that wonderful tax gatherer that the government has used over the decade or more&mdash;up to $10 billion it now collects. It impacts drastically on the cost of education for every young person. Whether they are trying to catch the bus every three or four months to spend time back with their families, or whether they are catching a bus to the university, whatever it is, these costs impact on the students of Australia. Of course, we will not talk about, in this discussion, the HECS contribution and the attempts at increasing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly touch on interest rates. In a variety of ways, interest rates impact on every aspect of Australian life. The other day I had one example pointed out to me by a state member, on state debt, which I think is worth noting. In the 1980s the state government of South Australia was paying something like $150 million on its outstanding state debt. During the 1990s, for a variety of factors we will not dwell on here, it went to a bit under $750 million. So there we have $500 million or $600 million dollars just in interest payments that that particular state is liable for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst all this discussion goes on about the role of the state and its contribution to the welfare of students&mdash;and no doubt it will come up at the federal election&mdash;the reality for the state of South Australia was that, with those three interest rate rises of last year, despite all the struggling to balance the books, or at least trying to balance the books, that $80 million or $90 million they tried to trim off to get to some balance was wiped out in one hit by those interest rate rises. That has an impact on the ability to develop facilities, to offer allowances and to allocate extra places in the universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to inflation. Inflation is on the march again in this country for a variety of reasons. That in itself just makes the hurdles in front of students that much more difficult. It has been said many times that all that the overwhelming majority of students wants to aim for is permanent and stable employment. In an earlier discussion I touched on the issue of regional Australia, where it is just that much harder and that much more difficult. I will not revisit that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my brief contribution this morning I say to the government: please acknowledge, at the very least, the impact that these increases in taxation, increases in costs, whatever they might be, do have on the students of Australia. We cannot continue to delude ourselves that they are just incidentals and off to the side&mdash;some sideshow in the general life of the nation. I now touch on a little inequity that people have brought to my attention in recent days in relation to the formal training allowance. There is a group between the ages of 18 and 21 that has the same costs, and increasing costs, because of the economic policies of this government. Those who are doing a CES approved course are denied $30 per week. They are denied $30 per week if they are doing a full-time course and $20 per week for a part-time course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That makes the difference for these young people to at least survive with a little bit of dignity. It is just another anomaly in the programs of the government. I appeal to the government to acknowledge these extra costs that are put on students and to acknowledge that, every time you take something away from them at the same time as you add a cost to them, you are making it just that much more difficult for them to contribute and to become citizens who can live with dignity and a positive approach which this nation will benefit from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fine. I am pleased to hear that, because it was a great concern of mine. In the original statements of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) and in the way in which this matter first came to the notice of the House, it appeared that the government was taking the step of putting 16- and 17-year-olds into a relationship with the government as its direct mendicants; and I am delighted to hear the minister say that that is not going to occur. I notice that the provisions of the explanatory memorandum allow for those additional family payments to continue where there are larger families, and we also have the incremental arrangement for families with more than three children, as the explanatory memorandum sets out. I thank the minister for the clarification. I am delighted to hear it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will confine my remarks to the citizenship provisions, which I think are a valid step for the government to take. Benefits in many areas should be confined to those people who are Australian citizens. I note that it is the government's intention, with regard to the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995, to provide for students who are permanent residents to receive Austudy until they achieve the age of eligibility or the period of residency that will entitle them to seek Australian citizenship, which is normally two years after the person has been granted permanent resident status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guarantees requested of migrant families&mdash;barring refugees&mdash;are such that, in most instances, there is no need for this provision. Families migrating to Australia should be prepared to carry the cost of education for their offspring until their students reach that entitlement status of two years residency and thus become eligible for Australian citizenship. I see no reason why the Australian community needs to further extend its largess to permanent residents who are waiting to receive citizenship. I see no anomalies there. There will be circumstances where a special benefit is needed, in cases of refugees or other people suffering hardship, and I am sure that the act could make allowances for that. I commend the government on this step, which is a wise one, and the minister's assurance concerning families is pleasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do note, however, a cheese-paring attitude in cutting payments down, thus saving $19 million per year for the first three years of this process. If any area of the Australian community needs support, it is Australian families. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) makes nice statements about having `family television'. That is no sop. That indefinite, pie in the sky promise of a family television station&mdash;`It will never happen; let's give it to Murdoch!'&mdash;is no substitute for support of the families of western Sydney, western Melbourne or anywhere else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank those honourable members who participated in the debate. I address some of the remarks that have been made. I want to begin, though, by assuring the Committee that the basic student payment does have the interests of young people at heart. It will clarify service delivery arrangements for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds. It has been admitted that, for some time, there has been confusion about whether the Department of Social Security or the Department of Employment, Education and Training should be the organisation to help these clients. Indeed, the opposition itself&mdash;Senator Tierney in the Senate in his committee report on Austudy&mdash;expressed concern about this very matter, about the need to get streamlined service to these clients in the face of apparent gaps between what happens in the Department of Employment, Education and Training on one hand and in the Department of Social Security on the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that the integration of all support for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds within DEET will help. If they are studying, they have available assistance through Austudy, Abstudy or now the basic student payment. If those 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds happen to be seeking work, assistance is available through the youth training initiative, again within the one department. The government believes that it is appropriate to locate services to all 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds in that one department because it also reinforces the expectations of the community and the government that young people should be supported actively to develop themselves through education and training or active jobsearch and not to stay passively on Department of Social Security welfare benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear the opposition's concern for young homeless people. A key element of the government's amendments to this bill is that they are explicitly intended to provide special support and protection for recipients of the Austudy student homeless rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) raised four questions which I will attempt to address in this response. The basic student payment, he said, is less generous than the basic family payment&mdash;$500 against $564. That is true, but I would point out to him that the new arrangements for the timing of the payments provide a much more sensible arrangement for assisting students, providing payments, as they do, at the beginning of each semester in the year of study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I turn to his assertion that the assets and income test for basic student payment is more stringent than for basic family payment. For a start, I turn to the income test. Farming and business families will be better off under the basic student payment assets test, but I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threshold for the personal income test will be similar to the current basic family payment and Austudy threshold of $6,000. However, the threshold for the parental income test will be similar to the basic family payment threshold, which will be $61,020 in 1996. That approach&mdash;I am sure the honourable member for Goldstein will agree&mdash;will ensure that higher income families will also receive assistance for their student children. The assets test will be similar to the assets test applying under Austudy. The family assets test, not including the family home, will be $393,750 next year&mdash;and that is less than the threshold applying under the basic family payment, which is $559,250. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the honourable member for Goldstein should remember that a 50 per cent discount applies to the value of business and farm interests owned and operated by one or more assessable family members. And when one applies the 50 per cent discount, remember it is to net assets excluding the home or, in the case of a farm, the homestead and curtilage. So it is net assets, free of debt, with a 50 per cent discount applied. That means that the assets threshold, say, for a farming family would be $787,500, which I think is slightly above the average farm value. Certainly, from data relating to success rates of Austudy applicants from rural areas as opposed to urban areas, there is little or no difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the fourth matter that the honourable member for Goldstein raised, the matter of category 2 loans, I am afraid I do not have the information available to me about the geographical location of those people in receipt of category 2 loans. But if he was attempting to make the case that, somehow or other, students from income-poor rural families would be excluded from loans because of the abolition of category 2, I should make the point to him that category 2 loans are available for the relatively better off students. They are available to students from families where the adjusted family income is just over $50,000. I think he has difficulty making out a case that we are affecting students from income-poor rural families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the broad, it is all part of the government's effort to tightly target student assistance to those students in greatest need. Remember, it is a big program; it involves spending of about $1.7 billion this year assisting over half a million students. We need to make sure that those benefits get to students who need them most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I will address is the honourable member for Goldstein's claim that youth unemployment now is actually higher than it was when Working Nation was introduced. I heard him say it last evening and he said it again today. On neither occasion has he given the committee the benefit of any figures. If I can help him with figures, the seasonally adjusted financial year average for teenage unemployment&mdash;the 15- to 19-year-olds&mdash;in 1993-94, which was the year that Working Nation was introduced, was 110,000. In 1994-95 it was 94,000&mdash;a drop of some 16,000. The rate of unemployment among those teenagers in the work force fell from 32.3 to 27.7 per cent and the rate of teenage unemployment as a proportion of the age group fell from 8.6 to 7.4 per cent over the period. As I say, I would be obliged if the honourable member for Goldstein would present the figures at some stage. </PARA>

<PARA>The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 1995 seeks to amend the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973 by, amongst other things, modifying the eligibility provisions for the Austudy scheme for certain permanent residents. These amendments clarify when those provisions apply. The bill currently refers to the day a permanent resident student first satisfied the residency requirements and provides that, if that day is more than 12 months past, the person is ineligible to get Austudy even if he or she does not currently satisfy the residency requirements. These amendments will clarify that the person who does not currently satisfy the residency requirements will not be affected by the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also introduce slightly different rules for permanent resident students who are not yet 19 years of age and who are eligible for the independent rate of Austudy because they are orphans or because their parents cannot exercise normal parenting responsibilities, or they are unable to live at home with their parents because of exceptional circumstances, or they are refugees, or they are in state approved care arrangements. Permanent residents in one of these groups will be able to get Austudy until they turn 19. This is because they cannot apply for citizenship in their own right until they are 18 and they then have one year in which to become Australian citizens. Once these students turn 19 they will, like all other Austudy recipients, be ineligible for Austudy after a particular day if on that day they satisfy the residency requirements but they have not continuously satisfied them for at least 12 months, and have not been approved for citizenship. </PARA>

The amendments were circulated yesterday as soon as caucus approval was obtained for them. I am also informed that Senator Hill's office was briefed fully on the amendments on Monday.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister said, the amendments appear to be relatively minor. However, we have not had time to study them and frankly I do not believe that Senator Hill's office has had a full briefing on these amendments. I have been in contact with them in the course of this debate and I have been unable to get from them any view of that kind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the department is under the impression that a briefing was given, it does not seem to have been a terribly satisfactory briefing because Senator Hill's office does not appear to be clearly aware that they had been informed of these amendments before yesterday. We just have to leave the matter as it stands there, and that is unfortunate. It is not a major issue in terms of the substance of these amendments but it is a matter of process and I register a protest about it.

I note that fact, and I am sure that the people of Australia will note that the government seems to be in a continuing state of confusion on these matters.

<PARA>The purpose of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is to amend the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983, the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952, the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965 and the Public Service Act 1922. Details of the various amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements the decision of the government which was announced in August 1994 to abolish the Economic Planning Advisory Council, the council, and establish in its place an Economic Planning Advisory Commission, the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government established the council in 1983, there was a clear need to improve consultation among business, trade unions, community groups and government, on economic issues. Over the past decade, EPAC has contributed substantially to promoting a broader understanding of Australia's medium- and long-term economic and social prospects and consultation is now much more widespread than in the early 1980s. The need for a body like the council has diminished accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now intends to build on the council's achievements by establishing the new commission. The new commission will assume the role of the office of EPAC rather than that of the council itself. Its public information role will be expanded and its new functions will allow it to focus more directly on the provision of advice to government on medium- to long-term social and economic issues. The commission will also have an expanded capacity to undertake special projects, such as the major national strategies conference `Shaping our future' held in November 1994, and to undertake task force work on particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Public Service Act will achieve two aims. As honourable members are aware, the annual reports of Commonwealth departments and budget funded agencies are a most important element in the overall accountability process. The Public Service Act requires annual reports to be prepared in accordance with guidelines approved by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. In March 1994, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts endorsed revised guidelines which require departmental annual reports to be tabled in both houses of the parliament by 31 October each year. The amendments to the Public Service Act will require secretaries to furnish their annual reports to ministers no later than 15 October. In turn, ministers will be required to table the reports in each house on or before 31 October each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that a secretary considers that the department's annual report cannot be given to the minister by 15 October, the amendments will allow the minister to grant an extension of time. However, if the minister forms the opinion that the report cannot be tabled by 31 October, he or she will be required to advise the parliament before that date of the reasons for the delay and the date by which the report will be tabled. The bill also makes special arrangements for the tabling of annual reports when parliament is not sitting on 31 October in a particular year and a house does not allow papers to be tabled out of session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will apply to annual reports for the 1995-96 financial year and subsequent years. However, in keeping with the arrangements which were put in place for the 1993-94 financial year, annual reports of all departments for the 1994-95 financial year have been handled in accordance with the new requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendments to the Public Service Act which the bill contains will facilitate personnel management in the parliamentary departments. Under the present arrangements, many of the powers of the Public Service Commissioner are conferred on the Presiding Officers in relation to the staff of the parliamentary departments. However, the act does not contain any provision which allows the Presiding Officers to delegate those powers to officers in their departments. They may not, for instance, delegate their power to appoint and promote staff, to create and abolish positions and to raise or lower classifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lack of a power to delegate means that the Presiding Officers are required to perform routine personnel management functions which are performed in other departments at relatively junior levels. These amendments would allow the Presiding Officers to delegate any or all of their personnel management powers, except the power to recommend certain matters to Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments would also confer on the Presiding Officers powers similar to those enjoyed by secretaries of Commonwealth departments in relation to the cancellation of promotions and the approval of promotions following a joint selection committee process. They would also allow the Merit Protection and Review Agency, which currently has no jurisdiction in relation to the parliamentary departments, to review promotions at or above the senior officer grade C classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, honourable members will recall that, following the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure in February 1994, the committee of the whole house was abolished and, consequently, the title of `Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees' was changed to `Deputy Speaker'. The Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act currently defines the term `Deputy Presiding Officer' in relation to the House of Representatives to mean `Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees'. The bill includes an amendment to correct the reference to the Deputy Speaker's title. The bill also amends the Parliamentary Allowances Act, which is administered by the Minister for Administrative Services, to correct the references to the titles of the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker in that act. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister and Cabinet (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1995 is an omnibus bill which amends four separate acts. As I understand it, these are the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983, the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952, the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965 and the Public Service Act 1992. It is a non-controversial bill in all aspects and the coalition will not be opposing it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of the main provisions of the bill seeks to amend the Economic Planning Advisory Council Act 1983. The bill abolishes the Economic Planning Advisory Council, known as EPAC, and establishes an Economic Planning Advisory Commission. This follows an announcement by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on 16 August 1994, that he was establishing a new so-called economic round table to replace EPAC, and that EPAC would be re-established as the Economic Planning Advisory Commission.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not exactly sure what has happened to this round table or where it disappeared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EPAC was established as a creature of the former Hawke government. It has, over a number of years, done some good work and it has done some other things about which the coalition has had some reasonable degree of criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government's relationship with the economic community through EPAC and now, supposedly, the commission&mdash;like the government's relationship with the ACTU through the accord mechanism&mdash;will have some influence in the broader community. The legislation does, I understand, do away with the tripartite consultative process, and the commission will rely more on advice to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and third acts that are amended by this bill are parliamentary acts: the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 and the Parliamentary Presiding Officers Act 1965. The bill makes minor technical amendments to both of these acts, principally to remove gender specific language and to update title references. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth act being amended by the bill is the Public Service Act 1922. The bill amends the Public Service Act to implement the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts to require departments to report to the parliament by 31 October each year. To enable that reporting to parliament by 31 October, the bill requires that annual reports be presented to ministers by 15 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes arrangements for reporting when parliament is not sitting. It allows the minister to grant exemptions from the deadline, subject to advising the parliament. It also provides for the granting to Presiding Officers of the ability to delegate various personnel and management tasks. The coalition has no problems with those amendments. They seem, at least, sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation of annual reports to parliament is an essential process now that the old system of estimates committees has changed. Much more reliance is now placed on the annual reports of departments and agencies. They have become a crucial, core element of the data and information available to the parliament for the examination of the workings of government. Therefore, the amendment in this bill to the Public Service Act is a very important amendment. The coalition has no objection whatsoever to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives me an opportunity, however, to talk about the subject stated in the title of the bill, the Prime Minister and the cabinet. We have a tired Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and an exhausted cabinet, and it seems to me that the process is not really working very well. You would recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that several years ago our current Prime Minister knifed the former Prime Minister, Mr Robert J. Hawke, and took his job away. This week we had an outstanding example of the former Prime Minister turning around and knifing the current Prime Minister, and taking away from him the spotlight on a major industrial relations dispute which has really socked this nation hard and badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Prime Minister, the member for Blaxland, comes to his job dishonestly. He had to steal from the Hawke government the prize&mdash;the prime ministership&mdash;through a whole series of manoeuvres that took several months while the country and the government were destabilised. Then in 1993, on 13 March, we went to the polls for an election to `legitimise' the Keating government. Quite honestly, it seems to me that the man himself took from the people an honest expression of their desire by dishonestly making all sorts of promises which the government has never kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look down the list of broken promises, we find it is an incredible list. Commitment to no tax increases was junked almost immediately after 13 March with the August budget. There were tax rises in wholesale sales tax, wine tax, petrol excise and tobacco excise, and it goes on and on. We are still paying the increases in wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the budget this year, on 1 July, once again, wholesale sales taxes went up across a huge range of products. The government proposed this year that we were going to tax construction materials, notwithstanding the fact that the housing industry is in one of the worse shapes it has been in for a very long time&mdash;it is really on the bottom. And the government proposed to go out and tax building materials. I will say that it is a good thing that this parliament had more sense than the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Willis), and, of course, the cabinet and the ERC, and rejected that little proposition. But it was a major broken promise. This government said, `No tax increases.' Paul Keating told the people, `Don't vote for this coalition mob because they are going to cost you a general goods and services tax, a broad based consumption tax, and we will keep the faith, we will make sure you don't pay any more taxes.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether it will or not, but there are one heck of a lot of people out there, including a lot of independently funded retirees in my electorate, who will never see those tax cuts and who will never see any benefit from those tax cuts. Yet the government, the Prime Minister and the cabinet tell us that people are going to be able to retire without having to resort to the age pension because of the government's compulsory scheme. What they forget to tell us is that it only occurs for people who enter the work force in 2002, and after they have worked 40 years they ought to be able to retire on their superannuation earnings with about the same amount that they would get on the pension&mdash;if their union dominated superannuation fund actually produces the goods, comes up with a profit and makes a very reasonable return on its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say this: an awful lot of people in this community will never see those tax cuts. A lot of people, quite frankly, will leave us&mdash;either leave our shores purposely or die&mdash;between now and the time that these so-called tax cuts, which now show up as superannuation contributions only for the work force, ever come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another broken promise: commitment to no more budget deficits after the recession we had to have. Remember that one, Mr Deputy Speaker? No more budget deficits. We were promised in this year's budget that in this financial year, 1994-95, the government was going to run at a surplus. That is in great doubt&mdash;it is in absolute doubt. There is very little likelihood that the government will meet its projections and manage the surplus. The surplus, of course, after increasing taxes which the government promised not to increase, was really only based on asset sales&mdash;that is, privatisation of government owned assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Victoria, some of my constituents have concerns about state government sale of publicly owned assets, and they write to me about that and they express their concerns. This is really some kind of ideological battle that I do not understand because this federal Labor government has sold just about everything that there is to sell, everything that is not absolutely nailed down. I say to the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) that there is not much left to sell. The people's bank that would never be sold has gone, has it not? The Commonwealth Bank, the people's bank, privatised, not owned by the government any more!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the government is going to sell long-term leases to the airports, it is going to sell the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the list goes on and on. By the time we get to government there is not going to be anything left to sell. This Keating government will have sold it all. There is not much of an ideological battle left to fight anymore. It is all gone. It has all gone to finance the budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said we would dispose of some government-held assets for two reasons&mdash;firstly, to improve their efficiency and their productivity for the benefit of the people of this country; and, secondly, to retire debt, and to provide funds to buy new, more productive assets that the nation needs to make business enterprises more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need more infrastructure. This government has let our national infrastructure run down. It has run down badly and we need capital spending and capital growth to assist industry to be more effective.

As far as I am concerned, that is another broken promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government attacks state governments. It has put the clamps on state government spending and made state governments become more efficient. At the same time this government's own spending has continued to increase at a rate greater than inflation, year after year. This government said there would be no taxes for age pensioners. Remember that one? That one did not just disappear into the never-never, it went under the carpet and down the black hole. I do not think we will see it resurrected in the life of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a very limited life. We do not know when this Prime Minister will have the guts to go to the polls.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thought it would probably be March, but the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said that the government would dump that important adjustment of parliament's sitting schedule&mdash;made by the former Treasurer, Mr Dawkins&mdash;which accommodates a budget prior to the beginning of the financial year. The government will dump that commitment. It will have a budget in August this year to give it more flexibility about when we go to the polls. How cynical can you be? Who knows when we will go to the polls? When we do, this mob will not be returned again. There is no question about that. </PARA>

He took them out and it became pretty nasty, and our reputation as an international supplier was being horrifically damaged.

One, the economists will tell you, is by increasing savings. I am not sure about that but I can tell for sure that one way of attacking the current account is by doing something about trade. Australia is a trading nation. We need to sell more to other people than we buy from them if we want ever to reduce our debt. That means we are highly dependent on trade&mdash;trade in and trade out. We do not do our trade very much good when we shut down the wharves and when we shut down the coalmines.

It is because the union bureaucracy is losing relevance. People are deserting the unions in droves: they are marching with their feet and they are marching with their dollars. As long as they do that, the union movement itself will continue to collapse. It drew the line in the sand but it is damaging the nation badly. </PARA>

Everybody gets the same. They all dress the same. They park in the same car park, if they work at the same job location. They all treat each other as human beings&mdash;as part of the company and as part of the culture of trying to improve the company's productivity, and the company's profits, so that there is a bigger share for everybody.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is considering a replacement for the Economic Planning Advisory Council that has, since the election of the Australian Labor Party, advised the government. It was conceived, I believe, by Prime Minister Hawke to be something of an independent sounding board. I remember that, in its first days, there were some concerns being expressed by the Prime Minister and others that EPAC appeared to be too independent. The EPAC reports were even made public on some occasions, for the community to make an assessment of whether or not the economic directions they were setting were in tune with community attitudes. The role of EPAC has changed and gradually it has become more secretive, more prone to be a reflection of government attitudes and less inclined to be an independent beacon for the Australian economy, the government and the businesses and families of Australia. We have now, putting it into a full quango format, a legislative proposal to change the name and revamp EPAC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a wonderful occasion for this House to indicate to the government some of the areas that it believes it should set as testing and landmark goals for EPAC. While the business community and the union movement are concentrating on what is called `best practice', I prefer it to be called `world best practice'. The way in which `best practice' is used around Australia now has devalued the term. `Best practice' can mean the best thing we do in our street, the best thing we do in our family or the best thing we do in this place. It is not related to the concept of total quality management, quality assurance or any of the international standards that are measurable standards, where you set yourself a goal and you make a measured assessment of where you need to be and how you are going to get there. `Best practice' is a denigrated term in Australia, and I believe it should be scrapped because it means little, particularly as it is tossed around hither and thither by the union movement. Best practice does need to indicate Australia's relative stance in the world community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that the new commission should do is to start to set a few standards: world best practice standards, quality achievements, total quality approaches. It should adopt, for government and government agencies, a process whereby just the very best of world standards will satisfy us so that we can actually measure ourselves against a goal. What the community wants is some way of measuring government performance. When we come to an election, it does not want the process of the group that can denigrate the other the most, or tell the most lies, or appear to be second worst in a contest, to be the standard by which success of government is measured. It wants to have a scorecard, a report card process, where governments can actually be rated against their commitments, be rated against their achievements. Those achievements can then be evaluated against what world standards are, what best practice really does mean, what quality management for government should be aiming to achieve and where the long-term future for Australians and their families rests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has refused to adopt any of these modern management techniques in any of its practices. It will skirt around proposals and come up with agencies like merit protection agencies. It will come up with all sorts of techniques that are a meaningless way of allowing us to continue the slow drift that has been the practice of this government since it came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is none of the dynamics that Bob Hawke brought to this place left in this government. In fact, in the current industrial dispute, those dynamics&mdash;faded somewhat, `lacerated,' the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says, to some extent&mdash;were brought back to play and have produced results. Now there are no dynamics. It is all a matter of managing crises and managing a grey stability that produces no results for the citizens of Australia. I believe the new commission needs to focus on some of the real issues that are worrying Australians and the community, whether it be the union movement, the employers or the families of Australia. I think it needs to set itself a few targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, if the whole resources of the Attorney-General's Department were turned over for three years to unravelling the complexities of our tax act, that would yield multimillion dollar results down the track for Australia. The government has no intention of giving anybody that brief. Michael Duffy used to talk about it as some sort of dream that he had. It would be a wonderful goal to allow an economic commission to try to unravel the processes of taxation and set some real targets for this body that is supposed to be part of the agenda of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the government has added heap upon heap, page upon page of complexity to our tax system. The cost of administration is often as much as the tax itself for many small businesses. We have a system where the government does not care about the cost of compliance or collection but only cares about whether it gets its money in. What a wonderful goal to give to a government agency, to turn loose the talents, ability and imagination of competent people in Australia to unravelling and to decomplexifying our tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about allowing such a commission to look at the unemployment problem&mdash;particularly the problem of young unemployed people&mdash;and to try to take out some of the factors of confusion, lack of hope and lack of challenge that young people in our cities and country towns face at the moment? There are some answers and there are prospects for young people. Some government programs contribute in some way towards alleviating the difficulties which confront young people, but there has been no national focus. Every now and then a minister jumps up to introduce some smart new program&mdash;such as the half-baked program called Working Nation&mdash;which has not been thought through. The programs consist of the best ideas collected from here, there and everywhere, half of which do not work and half of which do work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we not turn an expert or a competent body of some of Australia's brightest people&mdash;both in the bureaucracy and in the private sector&mdash;loose on a project such as this? But, no, the government will not allow the commission to tackle any large projects such as this. Why do we not turn the commission loose on our overseas debt? Only a few months ago the Prime Minister said, `This is the foreign debt we've got to have. It doesn't really matter all that much, anyway.' The fact that the ratio of our current account deficit to our gross domestic product is the worst in the world does not appear to worry the Prime Minister one iota, one jot, one tittle or one ounce. Australia was with Mexico at the bottom of the pops in 1994. Mexico has improved this year, but Australia remains slinging around at the bottom with a minus five per cent ratio. This ratio was calculated by the OECD by taking the ratio of our current account deficit and comparing it with our gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will not focus on the problem, nor will it focus a commission on the problem. The government has not tried to gain answers in any real way so that it can set up a chalkboard goal that we can aim for and so that the Australian community can measure the government's achievements against the government's attempts. I do not think this government would do this sort of thing. This government would rather grope around making day-to-day decisions and being critical of an opposition that it says has no policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason the government wants the release of the opposition's policies is so that it can go into the negative mode that it is so good at. The government wants something to criticise. The government wants to pull down because it cannot build up. This government has no proposals for anything positive and it has no vision or hope for Australia. This government would rather destroy. A destructive approach seems to be more in the nature of this government and its Prime Minister than is solving problems and giving challenges to the body that the government is putting into legislative form today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An economic commission should be doing positive things for Australia, but the government will not give it the goal of wiping out the complexity of our taxation system. The biggest bugbear for our business community is the complexity and the cost of administration of our taxation system. There is the unemployment problem&mdash;particularly youth unemployment&mdash;but the government will not give the commission this problem. The government will not give the commission the problem of the overseas debt to tackle. The commission is not even to look at the vexed health question. The health area is a very confused area where the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is under attack for things she has done or has not done and for things she can remember or cannot remember. The minister is an amazing woman for detail when it happens to suit a political point, but she is hopeless if she tries to remember something that should be right in the front of her mind from the time when she was Premier of a state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health costs have run away. Australians think that the situation is disastrous and they do not know how they can keep paying for their health needs. One only has to visit the retirees of Australia to understand their pain and anxiety when they look at future health costs, particularly the cost of private health insurance. There has been no effort made to resolve the problem. The minister mucked around with this thing for months and months and then she released some sort of paltry deal-making process between funds and hospitals which does not satisfy anybody and which people do not understand anyway. These problems would be great challenges for an economic body such as the one we have got set up here in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House some of the facts that need to be looked at when we look at things like taxation, employment and overseas debt. For instance, despite the claims that we are not going to move to indirect taxes, when this government came to office in 1983 the personal income tax collection figure was $24.6 billion. This year the figure will be $55.04 billion, which means that the personal income tax collection figure has more than doubled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the total tax take over the 12 or 13 years that this government has been in office, we will see that in 1983 the total tax take was $44.9 billion, or almost $45 billion, and the total tax take now is $105.3 billion. There has been a disproportionate increase in those areas of taxation unrelated to personal income tax. Therefore, the greatest proportion of increase for this government&mdash;a 240 per cent increase in the total tax grab&mdash;has been in the indirect taxation area. Yet this is the government that says, `We are not into indirect taxation.' What more indication could we have that the government's sophistry and its results are two different things? The government makes statements but does not perform. I think most Australians have come to acknowledge the Prime Minister as the master of opposite-talk. If he says unequivocally that he will do something, they know with complete certainty that he will do the opposite. That is the trust&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The most important provisions of this bill are aimed against police corruption. Members will be aware that the current Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service has uncovered distressing instances of corruption and other serious misconduct. Such abuse of power and of the community's trust can never be tolerated in any police service. I particularly regret that serving and former members of the Australian Federal Police have admitted to the royal commission their involvement, with members of the New South Wales Police Service, in corruption and other reprehensible behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the administration of the Australian Federal Police are strongly committed to ensuring that the force is never debilitated by a culture of corruption and misconduct. The institutional culture of a police force is of vital importance to a community. A police force stands at the threshold of the criminal justice system and is in effective control of the enforcement of the criminal law. Each police officer has an extensive authority over all other citizens, coupled with a wide discretion over its exercise. Subsequent stages in the criminal justice process, including courts and prisons, are largely dependent on the activities of police services, and will inevitably be affected by their deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is, of course, particularly dependent on the integrity and efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. Firstly, it is the prime agency for the enforcement of the Commonwealth's criminal laws. In this area, it is the Australian community's first line of professional defence against crime and disorder. In addition, the Australian Federal Police provide a vital link in effective cooperation with international law enforcement bodies. It is essential that the Australian Federal Police maintain the confidence of these bodies, as well as the public's confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, the government initiated a major and innovative reform of the legislation which governs the Australian Federal Police. The reform was designed, in part, to introduce a new and unique employment scheme which would inhibit the occurrence of the deep patterns of corruption discovered in other police services. One aspect of those reforms was the replacement of tenure with a system of fixed-term appointments. Another aspect was providing the commissioner with chief executive powers in relation to appointments within the Australian Federal Police, including the power to end the appointment of any police member or civilian staff member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principles underlying this employment scheme is that the commissioner should have a clear and specific responsibility for the integrity and operational efficiency of the Australian Federal Police. Naturally, the scheme also envisages that the commissioner should have the powers and authority necessary to fulfil these responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the commissioner's power to terminate the appointment of members or staff members of the Australian Federal Police is subject to only two exclusions. The current legislation states that the commissioner must not make use of this power merely because of an act by a member or staff member where a disciplinary charge has been or could be laid in relation to that act, or merely because a court has found the individual guilty of a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These exceptions were provided in order to separate the Australian Federal Police's disciplinary processes, which can result in dismissal as a penalty for disciplinary offences, from the commissioner's general power to end a person's appointment. In practice, the limitations on the commissioner's dismissal power can lead to situations which are clearly inconsistent with the policy aims of the AFP employment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, it is not clear that the commissioner can terminate the appointment of a member of the Australian Federal Police even if the member admits publicly that he or she is guilty of corruption or other seriously reprehensible behaviour. To dismiss that person from the Australian Federal Police, it might be necessary for the commissioner either to invite the member to resign voluntarily or to initiate disciplinary proceedings. The commissioner's hands could be equally tied if the person were to be convicted of serious criminal offences by a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes this situation to be unsatisfactory. Corruption in a police service can seriously undermine the professional self-respect and morale of the decent and honest police who comprise the majority of members. It can also seriously diminish public confidence in the affected police service. Immediate and effective action may be the only way to minimise the harm. On occasions it will not be desirable to wait for lengthy disciplinary or court proceedings to be finally resolved before acting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the bill will remove the present limitations on the commissioner's dismissal powers which relate to disciplinary offences and criminal convictions. The intention is to give the commissioner a broader and more effective power to end an appointment where the commissioner has lost confidence in a person's suitability for the vocation of policing or for continued employment in the Australian Federal Police. The amendment will, in particular, permit the commissioner to act quickly and decisively to end the appointment of a person where the commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that there has been serious corruption, gross abuse of power or serious dereliction of duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government believes it is necessary in the public interest for the commissioner to have a wide discretion to end appointments, it recognises that the employment rights of individual members and staff members within the Australian Federal Police should also be protected. Currently members and staff members are protected in two ways in the event that they are retired by the commissioner before the end of their term of appointment. First, the person who is retired may seek judicial review by the Federal Court of the commissioner's decision to end their appointment. Second, the retired person is entitled to compensation for the lost part of their appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this bill will widen the scope of the commissioner's powers to end appointments, the government believes it is also reasonable to extend to members and staff members additional remedies against the possibility that the commissioner's power might be exercised unfairly or unreasonably. Consequently, it has been decided that, in addition to the existing protective measures I have outlined, individual members and staff members who have their appointments terminated early will also have access to the remedies against unlawful termination of employment given to employees in division 3 of part VIA of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. At present the Australian Federal Police is excluded from those unlawful termination provisions by the industrial relations regulations. The relevant regulations will be repealed following the commencement of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes one exception to the opening of the unfair dismissal remedies to the Australian Federal Police. It provides that, where a person's appointment has been ended because of their conduct or behaviour, the commissioner may make a declaration that the conduct or behaviour amounts to serious misconduct and that the serious misconduct is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on professional self-respect or morale within the Australian Federal Police or on its reputation with the public or with an Australian or overseas government or law enforcement agency. Where a declaration of this kind is made, the person who has been retired will be excluded from the operation of the Industrial Relations Act provisions concerning unlawful dismissal. Such persons, however, will retain the present rights to compensation for their early retirement and to seek judicial review of the commissioner's declaration, as well as the decision to end their appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, the commissioner will be able to make a declaration only where the commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds, that there has been serious misconduct by the person who is retired. Serious misconduct is defined to include corruption, a serious abuse of power, a serious dereliction of duty and any other seriously reprehensible act or behaviour. It is also necessary that the commissioner believe that the serious misconduct is actually damaging, or is likely to damage, the Australian Federal Police in one of the ways I have indicated. This is in line with an agreement between the AFP and the Australian Federal Police Association which provides for the commissioner to exercise this power in cases of serious corruption and gross abuse of power. Further procedures will provide for consultation with the association in the exercise of the power and for me to receive reports annually on the use of such powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly these are special circumstances. They are circumstances in which immediate action by the commissioner is needed to maintain the internal integrity or the public reputation of the Australian Federal Police and where it is not appropriate that an outside tribunal should be able to remake the commissioner's decision. The amendment will permit the commissioner to make a declaration either before or after the behaviour or conduct in question becomes widely known. This is to allow the commissioner to act to pre-empt the threatened damage to the morale or reputation of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains several minor amendments concerning two separate matters. One group of amendments is intended to give the Governor-General the power to authorise the commissioner and the deputy commissioners to appoint or promote persons as commissioned officers with the Australian Federal Police. At present the legislation permits the Governor-General to give this authority only to the commissioner. The new arrangements are administratively more convenient. The amendments allow for appropriate safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of amendments deals with the disciplinary obligations of staff members when granted special leave of absence for service with an industrial association. The effect is to extend the existing provisions which deal with members to staff members as well. The amendments have no financial impact. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) for his second reading address. It gives some clarity to what is a short bill but not necessarily a bill that is easy to understand, particularly when, under the procedures that we now follow, a person does not readily have access to the second reading speech in a printed form when reviewing the bill and explanatory memorandum. At times it is very necessary to look at the detailed provisions and try to understand the nature of the proposals that the government has submitted. The bill is designed to amend the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 and deals with dismissal of Australian Federal Police officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When passing the Industrial Relations Act the government sought to exempt the Australian Federal Police from unfair dismissal in provisions of that act through a regulation which exempted all contract based employment, being a relatively new initiative in the area of the Australian Federal Police. However, recent interpretations in the courts in relation to these matters have cast doubts on whether this regulation is legally effective in relation to Australian Federal Police employment conditions. It seemed to us, therefore, that the bill was to remedy this unintended situation and, at the same time, to relax the conditions under which the commissioner may dismiss an officer from the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is often the case with amending bills, the amendments contained in the schedule in item 5 of the bill and provisions relating to dismissal are amended. The purpose of the amendment is stated in the explanatory memorandum as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This item reflects a concern that subsection 26E(3) of the AFP Act imposes unnecessary limits on the Commissioner's authority over individual appointments thereby affecting the Commissioner's ability to fulfil his or her statutory responsibilities for the AFP's operational efficiency and internal administration.</PARA>
<PARA>By way of background, the government did introduce major reforms to the operation of the Federal Police in the 1980s. In the Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989, amongst other things, the tenure of officers was abolished and replaced with fixed term appointments or contracts, as I identified earlier. Under these provisions the commissioner was prevented from ending an appointment merely because of an act or omission for which a disciplinary charge has or could be laid against a person or because a person has been convicted or found guilty by a court of a criminal offence within the meaning of the Australian Federal Police (Disciplinary) Regulations. The effect of this was that the commissioner could not terminate the appointment of a person who had been convicted of corruption or other reprehensible behaviour merely because of that conviction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To dismiss the person, separate disciplinary proceedings would have had to have been instituted. These provisions were set out in sections 26E(2) and 26E(3). The provisions in section 26E(2) provide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to this Act and the regulations, an appointment under sections 25, 26 and 26B ends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) when the term of appointment ends; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) if, before the end of the term, the Commissioner determines, in writing, that the appointment ends on a day specified in the determination, being a day earlier than the day on which the term ends, but not earlier than the day on which the determination was made&mdash;on the specified day.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsection (3) was the limiting section. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner must not make a determination under subsection (2) merely because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) of an act of omission of the member or staff member concerned in respect of which a charge has been or could be laid against the member or staff member under the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) a court has convicted the member or staff member of a criminal offence within the meaning of those Regulations, or has found the member or staff member guilty of such an offence without recording a conviction.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment in this bill removes section 26(3). The effect of that amendment is that the commissioner will be able to dismiss a person, irrespective of whether or not their behaviour has been or could be subject to a criminal or disciplinary charge. An officer may be now dismissed without being found guilty. A person whose appointment is ended will be able to appeal against the determination under the unlawful determination provisions of the Industrial Relations Act of 1988 or by judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act of 1977 and through the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next amendment of the bill deals with dismissal for reasons of corruption. Item 6 of the schedule inserts a new section 26F into the bill and it provides that, if a person is retired under 26E(2) because of serious misconduct, the commissioner may make a declaration to that effect. Proposed new section 26F provides that the commissioner must believe on reasonable grounds that the officer's behaviour:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) amounts to serious misconduct by the person; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) the professional self-respect or morale of some or all of the members or staff members; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the reputation of the Australian Federal Police with the public, or with any section of the public, or with an Australian or overseas government or law enforcement agency . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the bill, serious misconduct is defined to include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) corruption, a serious abuse of power, or a serious dereliction of duty; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) any other seriously reprehensible act or behaviour by a person, whether acting, or purporting to act, in the course of his or her duties as a member of staff or not.</PARA>
<PARA>The declaration must be made within 24 hours of the determination under section 26E(2) and a copy must be given to the person affected. But most importantly, if a declaration is made of serious misconduct, the dismissal will be excluded from the operation of the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act of 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result of these amendments is that there may be potentially three different classes of dismissal under the act. In each case the commissioner will be required to make a written declaration to that effect under section 26E(2). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be the situation where a person is dismissed for serious misconduct and the commissioner has made a declaration to that effect under proposed new section 26F. In that case, the dismissal will not be subject to unfair dismissal rules. Then there is the situation where a person has been dismissed but there has not been serious misconduct as defined under section 26F. In this situation, a declaration is not made and the dismissal will be subject to the unfair dismissal rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Potentially, there is a third class of dismissal. There may be a situation where a person is dismissed for serious misconduct and yet the commissioner does not make a declaration to that effect under 26F. This separate class exists because the legislation provides that under section 26F the commissioner may&mdash;I emphasise `may'&mdash;make a declaration of serious misconduct. In these circumstances, the dismissal will not be subject to unfair dismissal provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains minor amendments. The first item deals with the minister's power to appoint an acting deputy commissioner if the position is vacant. The second item provides for delegation of the commissioner's or deputy commissioner's disciplinary powers to staff members when the commissioner or the deputy commissioner is absent. Items 3 and 4 deal with the power of the Governor-General to authorise deputy commissioners as well as commissioners to make appointments or promotions by the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the act will provide that a federal police officer may be dismissed without actual proof of guilt, without separate disciplinary proceedings being instituted. For a dismissal, the commissioner needs only to believe on reasonable grounds that there has been misconduct. However, the position of a dismissed officer is largely protected by the fact that there are appeal mechanisms in place. Where there has not been a declaration of serious misconduct, the person who is dismissed may challenge the decision through the industrial relations system or through judicial review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that the employment contract under which the Australian Federal Police are employed provides for compensation for dismissal. Where the dismissed officer is facing charges, compensation moneys are withheld until the charges are decided. Compensation is not paid if the officer is found guilty of corruption or other charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the drafting of the bill an agreement was reached among the Australian Federal Police, the police association and the ACTU in relation to the power of the Australian Federal Police to dismiss officers. The Australian Federal Police Association does not believe that the bill accurately reflects that agreement in that proposed new section 26F should apply only to gross misconduct and not just serious misconduct. It is difficult to see the practical differences between gross and serious, but that is a matter that the association has raised. It is also concerned about the lack of easily accessible appeal procedures. As the bill removes unfair dismissal provisions in relation to dismissal for serious misconduct, a person is able to appeal only through the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police Association is concerned about the increased potential for a commissioner to abuse his position with the introduction of more flexible and more expansive dismissal provisions. Its concern is framed in the light of the finding of the Fitzgerald royal commission that the commissioner of the Queensland police was himself corrupt. However, such concerns must be considered in the light of the benefits that this legislation bestows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will be supporting the bill on the basis that it is essential that commissioners be given maximum flexibility to fight corruption. It is vital that commissioners be in a position to be able to dismiss corrupt officers effectively and swiftly. This is, unfortunately, needed, as it has been demonstrated by the Wood commission in New South Wales that corruption does exist and it is known to exist also in the Federal Police. This is not to say that all or a majority of police are corrupt, but it is important that all elements of corruption are dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales royal commission this year has uncovered extensive and systematic corruption in the New South Wales police force and, as part of the process of uncovering corruption in that force, members of the Australian Federal Police have been implicated. According to reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, at least 10 Australian Federal Police officers, implicated in the royal commission, have admitted to corruption and have resigned. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> we read similar comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past few weeks, six serving AFP officers, including senior officers up to the rank of superintendent, have been forced to resign after `rolling over' to the royal commission and admitting corruption. A further eight former officers have been adversely named or have rolled to the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission has a charter to investigate corruption in the NSW Police Service but during its investigations into the Joint Drug Task Force, staffed by Federal and State officers, it has uncovered serious corruption by AFP officers.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Justice, in a speech which he made at the opening of new premises on the Gold Coast for the Australian Federal Police&mdash;I note that he made it in the electorate of my colleague the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan)&mdash;had some things to say in relation particularly to the Yakuza. I know that my colleague takes an interest in that body because of the serious threat that it poses to law enforcement. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally I am . . . disappointed that some former AFP officers have behaved corruptly.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that he hoped for a clean force. He made the observation that no minister should ever claim that there is no corruption.

He made the point that it would be naive&mdash;and he said that he is not that&mdash;and he said that he is not complacent on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My comments, however, in relation to this matter, I suppose, stem from the fuller report that I have seen on these matters contained in the issues paper that has been distributed by the Australian Law Reform Commission. That issues paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Under the spotlight&mdash;complaints against the AFP and the NCA</EMPHASIS>, in actually outlining why the Law Reform Commission was not going to be looking into these matters, did give, I think, for the first time I have seen it, some fuller statement as to what has been happening in the New South Wales royal commission. It said in paragraph 5.8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New South Wales Royal Commission into Police has recently heard evidence about a number of former and current AFP members being involved in corruption. Ten of the first 16 police officers who have thus far admitted corruption and given information to the Royal Commission are current or former AFP officers and were members of the now disbanded joint Commonwealth-State drug task force.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was also evidence given of corruption in the now disbanded Federal Narcotics Bureau. A current AFP superintendent, codenamed JTF 14, has admitted to improperly planting a knife at the scene of an arrest some 12 years ago. JTF 16, another AFP officer, has admitted to receiving $60,000 for leaking information on AFP operations and investigations.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Royal Commission has made no formal findings on any of these matters including the extent of any AFP members' involvement in corruption or on the general issue of corruption within the AFP. In these circumstances this inquiry has determined not to attempt to draw any conclusions from the Royal Commission investigation until relevant formal findings are published. However, the Commission welcomes general comments on these issues and other relevant issues arising from the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the first statement that I have seen about the nature and extent&mdash;I may not have followed the reporting closely enough&mdash;of Australian Federal Police involvement, and, while it refers to former AFP officers, it does refer to current Australian Federal Police officers. I note that the Minister for Justice in his speech said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I particularly regret that serving and former members of the Australian Federal Police have admitted to the Royal Commission their involvement, with members of the New South Wales Police Service, in corruption and other reprehensible behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>Presumably there are some officers in the Australian Federal Police to which these provisions may need to extend but, given the nature of the discussion in these debates, I wish to simply note that one issue that was raised in the Law Reform Commission report which gave concern to me was, in any disciplinary proceedings, the extent to which it might be possible for people to resign from the force voluntarily in advance of corruption issues being dealt with, thereby avoiding the consequences that might flow as a result of their corrupt activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, in his second reading speech, did mention that where there is a termination of employment there may still be some action against members arising from the terms of their contract. I would certainly like the minister's assurance that there will be in relation to these particular amendments, which do not deal with the question of voluntary termination, sufficient protection of the public interest to ensure that nobody escapes, fully or partially, the consequences of their actions if they have been corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important issue. There has been relatively little comment at a federal level about these issues, presumably because at this stage the royal commission has not concluded its examination in New South Wales. There have not been findings by that commission, but potentially these matters do have quite significant implications for the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are amending legislation to ensure that the commissioner has appropriate authority in these matters, I would certainly value the minister's assurance that there are not other issues which ought to be addressed in legislation of this sort but which we fail to address at this time, particularly in relation to voluntary resignations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that recently, in New South Wales, Superintendent Lysaught&mdash;I may not have the officer's title correct&mdash;attempted to resign but his resignation was not accepted by the police board in New South Wales. I would certainly like to know if there is a capacity to decline to accept resignations at a Commonwealth level and, if any of those who are mentioned in the royal commission are seeking to quit the service, that appropriate steps are taken to ensure that they are not able to do so if that is going to give them some particular advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention finally the issues paper of the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Australian Law Reform Commission has been looking at the issue of shortcomings in relation to, particularly, the complaints system. The fact that it is looking at these issues, particularly when complaints might be linked to corruption, is a matter that makes the issues raised in the paper by the Australian Law Reform Commission more germane. The commission has been asked to report on the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 and the complaints and disciplinary system in its entirety. It received that reference in March of this year; a final report is expected by June next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to preface my remarks by saying that I believe that most police officers at federal level, as well as in Queensland and indeed in the other states, are honest. They endeavour to do their job to the best of their ability. The reports that we have read of instances of corruption impact adversely on the ability of all honest police&mdash;the overwhelming majority of police at state and federal level&mdash;to discharge their duties to the community. Whenever we find reports such as those delivered by the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland or the continuing revelations from the Wood royal commission in New South Wales, it is increasingly difficult for police officers to carry out their duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, during the Fitzgerald inquiry, when police were endeavouring to go about their ordinary duties as police officers&mdash;whether apprehending speeding motorists, investigating domestic affairs or investigating crime&mdash;on many occasions the people to whom these police spoke said to them, `You are corrupt; we do not trust you.' This is why it is very important to adopt what the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is suggesting in the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill&mdash;that we should be creating a culture in the police force which is hostile to corruption. In this matter the minister enjoys the support of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of those issues where, as members of parliament, we do have a responsibility to the Australian people, to ensure that the legislation relating to police administration is appropriate and conducive to creating the kind of culture against corruption that we need in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us were dismayed by the revelations from the recent Wood royal commission, which implicated not only police officers in New South Wales, but also a large number of members of the Australian Federal Police. It was clear that the dismissals provisions in the Australian Federal Police Act were not adequate. The commissioner was inhibited from acting against police officers who were strongly suspected of being guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the only way the commissioner was able to dismiss officers was when those officers had been found guilty of misconduct. Obviously any officer who was found guilty of misconduct should be sacked, and certainly should not be left on the public payroll. But quite often there are very many officers who might well be guilty. If there is very strong evidence of their being guilty, and the commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that they are guilty, it is right that the commissioner should be able to act against those police officers prior to their actually being found guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are safeguards in the legislation. If a police officer is dismissed, and in due course is not found guilty, there would be compensation paid to that officer. What we need to do in this legislation is to achieve a balance. On the one hand, we need to consider the rights of the individual, the right of the police officer to fair treatment, and the right of the police officer not be permanently damaged as a result of smears. On the other hand we have to make sure that the Australian community maintains its confidence in the police system and in the criminal justice system. What the government of the day has to do is to achieve a balance, and the government has sought to do so in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the drafting of this legislation, there were discussions initiated by the minister. The Australian Federal Police were involved, the Australian Federal Police Association was involved, and also&mdash;for some reason&mdash;the government's master, the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There was widespread agreement that the commissioner did need powers that he currently does not possess, and that the commissioner should be given the power to dismiss officers, subject to reasonable safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those safeguards are set out in the bill that we are currently debating. Regrettably, the Australian Federal Police Association now suggests that the proposed legislation does not accurately represent the agreement reached in those discussions involving the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Federal Police Association and the ACTU. The association says that this legislation is not appropriate, and that the commissioner, while he ought to have powers to dismiss police officers guilty of gross misconduct, ought not to be able dismiss police officers guilty of a lesser standard of misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to entrench the powers of the commissioner to sack a police officer, or other staff, for corruption or serious misconduct. As has been indicated by the shadow minister, the coalition does not oppose the passage of this bill. This legislation will effectively change the grounds on which a police officer can be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is currently prevented from dismissing an officer until that officer has been pronounced guilty of misconduct. However, the bill will permit the commissioner to dismiss any officer where he has reasonable grounds to believe the officer is guilty. When evidence is given against that officer in a commission or where evidence has been given to the commissioner that that officer, most probably, is corrupt, the commissioner is able to act and can dismiss that officer, even if charges have not been laid against the particular officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing terms of employment contracts&mdash;a dirty word as far as the government is concerned&mdash;an officer is paid compensation if dismissed by the AFP for misconduct, but, where corruption or other charges are proven, officers found guilty of such charges clearly are not entitled to compensation and, if an officer is dismissed while facing charges, compensation is quite naturally withheld until the outcome of those charges has been decided upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police has endeavoured to come to an arrangement which is satisfactory to the community. Regrettably, at this stage the Australian Federal Police Association is not happy with the legislation. I hope that it will come to be satisfied with it. It is very important that we have cooperation between the commissioner and the police association. One of the problems that the association has had is that it says commissioners themselves are not necessarily untainted by corruption. We have had a situation in Queensland where the then commissioner, Sir Terence Lewis, was found guilty of corruption. I suppose the association is saying, `You have, under the legislation, the commissioner deciding whether someone should be sacked. What happens if the commissioner himself is corrupt?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No one is suggesting that the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is corrupt, but the scenario highlighted by the association is possible, although quite unlikely. If we are going to vest chief executive powers in someone, then we ought to be careful about the person in whom these powers are vested. I daresay the government of the day would have to look very closely at the quality of any applicant for the position of Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. I believe this has been done in this case and I would imagine that following the change of government at the next election we would continue to follow that very prudent procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people are concerned that the proposal in the bill might be unfair to police officers who are not found guilty of corruption, but the major problem that we have in society is that, at the present time, we are sustaining a loss of confidence in the police and the criminal justice system and the community is demanding that we, as legislators, redress that problem. We ought to make sure that confidence is restored. I believe the legislation currently before the chamber will go some considerable distance towards making a statement to the Australian people that the parliament will not tolerate corruption in the police forces in any shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has said that no minister should ever claim that there is not corruption within his or her force. That is a very reasonable statement. No matter how well intentioned ministers are, one can never be absolutely certain that there is no corruption. What one needs to do is to create a climate where there is a culture in the police service which is hostile to corruption. I daresay that governments across the nation are seeking to move in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Wood has said that, if there is an acceptance among a significant body of police that they can safely and intuitively corrupt others, that is a matter of very great concern and a situation that is totally unacceptable, and that the contrary should be the proposition. He pointed out that the vast majority of police are honest&mdash;I said that earlier&mdash;and that he had a great deal of confidence in young police in particular. I also endorse the comments made by Mr Justice Wood in this respect. I have met very many fine police officers in the federal service and also in the Queensland service and, clearly, they are doing an excellent job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Wood has gone on to say that the very best that could happen is that the band of detectives who have lived and developed in the tradition of corruption should get out of the force and do it as quickly as possible. That is all very well but, if one makes such a blanket statement, it could be that certain police officers who have served with great distinction for a very long time might be unfairly roped into the net and be deemed to be unsuitable officers whereas, in fact, they have endeavoured to do the best they can on behalf of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we ought to do is to support this legislation. I am pleased that every member of the House is indeed backing this particular legislation, which will ensure that extra powers are given to the police commissioner where he is convinced that a particular person is guilty of serious misconduct. One really ought to look at the bill just to see what is intended by `serious misconduct'. As the name suggests, it is behaviour which is of a very substantially concerning nature. Section 26F, which is to be inserted in the legislation, provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"26F(1) If a person is retired under paragraph 26E(2)(b) because of his or her conduct or behaviour and the Commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds, that that conduct or behaviour or any part of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) amounts to serious misconduct by the person; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) the professional self-respect or morale of some or all of the members or staff members; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the reputation of the Australian Federal Police with the public, or with any section of the public, or with an Australian or overseas government or law enforcement agency;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Commissioner may make a declaration to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(2) A declaration must be made as soon as possible, but not later than 24 hours, after the Commissioner makes the determination under paragraph 26E(2)(b).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(5) In this section:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">serious misconduct includes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) corruption, a serious abuse of power, or serious dereliction of duty; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) any other seriously reprehensible act or behaviour by a person, whether acting, or purporting to act, in the course of his or her duties as a member or staff member or not."</PARA>
<PARA>So the definition contained in the legislation is a definition which includes conduct of a nature which no-one could defend, and I think it is eminently appropriate that the police commissioner ought to have the power, in these circumstances, to dismiss people who the commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds, are guilty of serious misconduct. We are not talking about very minor conduct; we are talking about serious misconduct. It ought to be noted that there are provisions for appeal to the Federal Court where a police officer believes that his or her dismissal is not fair, and so there are safeguards included in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Summing up, it is important to recognise that the Australian community is entitled to have confidence in our police services in Australia. I think it is important to recognise that people who are serving officers in the police services of this nation are entitled to fair treatment, are entitled to reasonable treatment and are entitled to be considered as human beings endeavouring to do the right thing by their fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, because of the need to ensure that there is confidence in the police service, I believe that this legislation, which gives the AFP commissioner extra powers, is absolutely vital. It is completely unacceptable that we should read that large numbers of federal and other police officers are admitting corruption and yet under the existing legislation the police commissioner is unable to take action against those police officers until such time as they have been found guilty in a court. If there is a situation where a police officer is indeed dismissed pursuant to this legislation and he is subsequently found not to be guilty of corruption, then quite appropriately there are compensation provisions written into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend the government on the bill which is before the chamber. I think that it is a balance. The police association feels that perhaps the balance is not quite right. The police association feels that the legislation we are debating today does not quite represent the agreement entered into by the Federal Police with the association and also with the ACTU. The minister clearly believes that it does and that the legislation we are currently debating is appropriate, given all of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, I suppose it comes down to a judgment. One has to try and get the appropriate balance. The government and the opposition believe that the appropriate balance has been achieved; the association has some problems at the edges. I am sorry about that, it is regrettable that that has occurred, but I think the interests of the community in this matter should be paramount. The coalition has consulted widely in the Australian community and people have indicated to us that, essentially, they are happy with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing revelations, through the New South Wales royal commission, in relation to corruption meant that something had to be done. The minister claims, incidentally, that this legislation has not been caused by the New South Wales royal commission and that this restructure was under way prior to the reports we read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and other newspapers about corrupt officers. I do not know whether that is the case or not. But, whether it is the case or not, this legislation is necessary, it is appropriate, and I am very pleased to have the opportunity to support it in this place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns about this legislation arise out of the Fitzgerald royal commission. As the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) said, the opposition is supporting passage of the legislation&mdash;although not all members of the opposition are doing so with quite the degree of enthusiasm that he has. The matter of police corruption and how it is to be handled is one fraught with difficulty. All of us would acknowledge that the revelations in the Wood royal commission mean that some action has to be taken in the event that the commission makes a finding that certain Australian Federal Police officers are corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Fitzgerald royal commission in Queensland we had the spectacle of corrupt members resigning from the police force. Indeed, the then Commissioner Lewis himself attempted, as things got warmer for him in the course of that inquiry, to take a type of leave which would have seen him with his full superannuation payout. We had the situation there where certain officers found devices to resign and get their superannuation payouts. There was public outrage about it&mdash;and quite properly so. It certainly must not be allowed to happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that this bill attempts to address that matter. But it is not a matter that is going to be specific to the Wood royal commission. It is a law that will be in place for all time, unless parliament at some time in the future sees fit to amend it. I have no quarrel with Commissioner Palmer. I am very anxious to put that on the record. However, we do have to consider all the possibilities. We have evidence that it is possible that corruption within a police force can be run from the top&mdash;and that evidence comes from Queensland where Commissioner Lewis was in charge of the major corrupt activities of the Queensland Police Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great horror of the stories that unfolded there was that corruption was institutionalised within the Queensland Police Service because it happened at a senior level. One of the things that emerged, however, was that he was corrupt long before he got to be commissioner. In fact, on the evidence that came out, he should never have been commissioner. It was as he and others rose through the ranks of the police service that corruption became endemic. It did not become any more serious a problem once he was commissioner, except that one would suspect that an awful lot of honest cops would then have been looking for an easy way out of the police force and for other jobs because they would have seen themselves as part of something they just could not stomach any longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, in implementing this legislation, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police is not necessarily going to have personal knowledge on all occasions of all the police to whom this bill might apply. He is going to have to rely heavily on information put before him by his subordinates. We should have a concern not only about the role played in this by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police but also, or alternatively, by any ranking AFP officer. As I have tried to indicate, it can be senior police&mdash;but not necessarily at the most senior level&mdash;who can be responsible for institutionalising corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the Fitzgerald royal commission also revealed was that, when there had been responsible members of that police force who had attempted to do something about corruption, superiors who were corrupt made life absolutely intolerable for them. There was a suggestion that certain police were set up by corrupt officers on charges of corruption. Let me make this clear: honest police were being set up by dishonest police on charges of corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one celebrated case which goes on and on in our press in Queensland. I do not know the rights and wrongs of the case. I have no inside information on it but, in a nutshell, it involves a member of the Queensland Police Service who was convicted of the criminal offence of conspiring to murder another police officer. As I have said, this matter has gone on for years and was a quite celebrated case even before the Goss government was elected, so I am talking about something that goes back more than six years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Wayne Goss, when he was Leader of the Opposition, promised a pardon for this policewoman. The pardon has never happened. The policewoman has been released from gaol and the conviction has been quashed, because it was established that fabricated evidence was used in her trial. After a very long and noisy public struggle, since the election of the Goss government, she did succeed in getting established an inquiry into the whole matter. However, the inquiry, whilst it did not say she had committed the crime, did not exonerate her and did not recommend a pardon. In the course of the inquiry, she gave evidence that she had been set up by corrupt police, but other police gave evidence that she was the one who was corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is every other member of the public who does not know the inside story, I am utterly bemused by the whole endeavour. The policewoman has had her conviction quashed, but she still remains partly condemned because she has not been pardoned. I have not got up to plead her case today, because I do not know the facts that would make it necessary for that to happen. I give that as an instance of how one can get into some very murky water when it comes to the subject of unproven allegations of corruption in the police force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the defence against this provision in the bill before us today being used improperly is the power which we are now giving to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, at least nominally, of an appeal to the Federal Court. I, for one, do not see that as a totally satisfactory solution. It is a necessary part of a remedy for injustice, but I do not see it as a total remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the scenario that I paint were ever to eventuate&mdash;where senior corrupt police officers were attempting to set up innocent police officers in order to protect themselves from matters related to their own corruption&mdash;the chances are that you would get the result that the honest cops would just get out. They would get out from under, and you would have a wastage of the very people that we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There need to be some checks and balances in this, in a way that does not make it too difficult for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to act when action needs to be taken, but that simultaneously makes it too difficult for corruption ever to flourish under what purports to be an anti-corruption regime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill 1995 was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) on 18 October. The purpose of the bill is to allow the Police Commissioner to sack a police officer or staff member in cases of corruption or other serious misconduct. This bill appears to be prompted by the recent revelations of the New South Wales Police royal commission on corruption implicating the Australian Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFP was reported, in October 1995, to be not confirming the number of police who had resigned in connection with the corruption allegations. Later that month, it was reported that the commissioner, Mr Mick Palmer, had requested powers for the instant dismissal of officers, in the context of concerns that corrupt officers could remain on the AFP payroll for up to three years while they sought appeals through the merit review procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFP annual report for 1994-95 reveals the results of the activities of the Internal Security and Audit Division of the AFP over the past year. ISAD's primary role is to combat alleged corruption in the AFP. In the last year, the Operations and Intelligence Branch of ISAD investigated 87 references and completed 60 investigations. As a result, 47 of the allegations in those references were substantiated and 59 allegations were not substantiated. ISAD recommended, after completing the 60 references, that 39 criminal charges and five disciplinary charges be laid. ISAD further recommended, in four cases, that fixed-term appointments either not be renewed or be terminated. The division also recommended that seven of what the annual report describes as `other administrative actions' be taken. Two of the 60 references resulted in the laying of serious criminal charges against two AFP investigators. All this is obviously a cause for grave concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to ISAD, the Internal Investigations Division of the AFP investigates all complaints and allegations about the actions of AFP members. During 1994-95, the IID recorded 900 complaints about the AFP, made by 596 complainants. During the year, 1,101 complaints about the AFP were finalised by the Ombudsman. Only 70 of those complaints, or 6.4 per cent of the total, were substantiated. None of the substantiated complaints related to criminal activity. The largest categories of substantiated complaints were neglect of duty, misuse of authority, and complaints involving property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its present form, the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 empowers the commissioner of police to dismiss an officer by making a written determination that the officer's term of appointment is to come to an end. At present, the commissioner cannot dismiss an officer on the basis of nothing more than that the officer has breached the discipline regulations, or that the officer has been found guilty of a criminal offence within the meaning of those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the commissioner is not able to terminate the appointment of a person who has been convicted of corruption or other similar behaviour merely because of that conviction. The government states, in its explanatory memorandum, that to dismiss that person it is necessary for the commissioner to initiate separate disciplinary proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because AFP officers are employed on a contract basis, it was intended that they be outside the unfair dismissals provisions of the federal industrial relations legislation. However, recent court decisions have cast doubt on whether the existing power to dismiss officers is, in fact, outside the unfair dismissals legislation. In addition, dismissed officers may challenge the commissioner's determination, either at common law or under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 on matters of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the dismissal power will remove the restriction that requires the commissioner to initiate separate disciplinary proceedings. The implication is that, under the amended act, the commissioner may terminate the appointment of an officer irrespective of whether he or she has been convicted of a criminal or disciplinary offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill would also insert a new section into the Australian Federal Police Act giving the commissioner the express power to make a written declaration that a person's appointment had been terminated for serious misconduct. The section will apply where the commissioner believes, on reasonable grounds, that the officer's behaviour amounts to serious misconduct which is having, or is likely to have, a damaging effect on morale or the public image of the Australian Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill defines serious misconduct to include corruption, a serious abuse of power, a serious dereliction of duty and other seriously reprehensible behaviour by a person. If the commissioner makes a written declaration of serious misconduct, as provided for by the bill, he must do so within 24 hours of making the determination to dismiss the officer, and must give a copy of the declaration to the dismissed person. If the commissioner makes a declaration of serious misconduct, then the officer who is the subject of that declaration is prevented by the provisions of the bill from having any recourse under the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is stated in the explanatory memorandum to be due to `the special powers and duties entrusted on members of the AFP'. A dismissed officer the subject of a declaration of serious misconduct will still have access to the courts for judicial review of the decision made to terminate his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clearly a need to ensure that corrupt officers are removed from the AFP at the earliest proper opportunity. For this reason, the coalition does not oppose the bill. My personal support of the coalition position is, I must say, somewhat reluctant. I am not satisfied, despite the minister's assurance, that appropriate safeguards to protect innocent individual officers are contained in the bill. I urge further consideration by the minister of the alleged safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest it be misunderstood, I am on the record in relation to telecommunications and interception legislation as believing that corruption of police is one of the most insidious diseases that can affect society, and I do not resile from that at all. I am just a little concerned that there may be an over-reaction to the revelations in the New South Wales police commission, the Wood commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill ensures that corrupt officers of the category referred to may be dismissed peremptorily and enables the commissioner to dismiss them without reference to the proper dismissal procedures set out under the industrial relations legislation. A basis of the bill is that any concerns about depriving a dismissed officer of recourse under the industrial relations unfair dismissal provisions are balanced by the need to deal expeditiously with corruption and other serious misconduct in the force. But there is a need for parliament to take great care when it contemplates empowering the commissioner to sack an officer on unproven allegations of corruption or other misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police officers, more than most citizens, are well aware that in the eyes of the law one is innocent until proven guilty. The proposals in the bill make the AFP commissioner judge, jury and executioner in relation to allegations of serious misconduct made against a member of the AFP. Bearing in mind that it is not uncommon for criminals to attempt to set up police officers, we must be vigilant not to deprive police of rights accorded to other citizens. In my view, the safeguards to protect the rights of officers are not adequate to balance the broad power bestowed on the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill authorises the commissioner to exercise the power when he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the officer's behaviour amounts to serious misconduct that is damaging to morale. A low standard of proof is involved&mdash;certainly lower than the standard of proof `beyond reasonable doubt' necessary for a criminal charge to succeed. What is contemplated is that the commissioner will be satisfied on reasonable grounds, in effect, that an offence has been committed. </PARA>

The commissioner will make a written declaration under the provisions of the bill that the appointment of the officer to the force is terminated before its due expiry because the commissioner believes the officer's conduct amounts to serious misconduct likely to damage the morale and reputation of the force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To consider the adequacy of the safeguards, it may be appropriate to take a particular example. Assume that several AFP colleagues, themselves involved in criminal activity, a situation to which the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) has just made reference, have decided to frame an innocent officer who is suspicious of the activities of those officers. They put some narcotics in his locker and stitch up the evidence so that the case for corruption against him is convincing. This gives the commissioner, who is unaware the officer is being framed, reasonable grounds for believing that the officer is guilty of serious misconduct as defined in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner, it can be assumed, then carefully makes the prescribed written declaration and follows to the letter the procedure for dismissal. Once the commissioner has made the declaration, the officer finds himself in the position of being presumed guilty and having to prove his innocence. He has lost his job; his career is ruined; and, worst of all, his reputation as a person of honesty and integrity is in tatters. It is essential, in that situation, that the officer have a proper remedy against the dismissal. The factual situation I have set involves corruption within the police, but a similar situation could be set which does not involve corruption within the police. It involves the same sort of thing being done, not by corrupt police officers, but by criminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the remedies? A number might be suggested. First, under the disciplinary regulations there is no appeal to the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal. It might be thought there was a merits review to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Australian Federal Police Act does not make any provision for such an appeal. The officer might contemplate bringing proceedings at common law for breach of contract. He is faced with the position where he has to prove that he is innocent of any wrongdoing and bring a case in a common law court himself. What he has to do is to prove a negative. He does not at that stage even know properly what the case against him is. Short of being able to draft a statement of claim that will withstand a striking-out application, he may not be able to get the action off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be disciplinary charges brought, in which event there may be evidence brought against him, and there may be criminal charges brought, in which case he would have the opportunity of cross-examining those presenting the evidence against him. That would be something of a protection, but those charges may not be brought either before the police tribunal or before a court. If corrupt officers are involved, there may be good reasons found within the force for not bringing such proceedings: they may be regarded as a risk to other operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remedy the minister has particularly relied upon is the proceeding under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. Equally there is an action at common law for similar rights. The proceeding under the judicial review act is a proceeding in which there is a review as to a question of law. It is not a review as to an issue of fact. The only way that the proceeding would be got off the ground by the dismissed framed officer would be if he could demonstrate that the commissioner, in making his decision to terminate and to issue the declaration, had erred in law. He would have to demonstrate either that there was no evidence upon which the commissioner could reasonably act or that the commissioner had acted on irrelevant considerations. In order to do that, he would have to disprove the case against him without at that stage actually knowing what the case against him is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An application under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is usually got off the ground by a person affected by a decision of an administrative decision maker by obtaining reasons. There is a statutory requirement under the judicial review act for the decision maker to provide reasons on an appropriate request by a person affected by the decision. In the particular case of a decision to terminate an appointment under section 26E of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979, the right to reasons is excluded. The only point that might save an AD(JR) application for a dismissed framed officer is that there is no exclusion of a right to reasons from the commissioner for the making of the declaration, and that is the only safeguard he has. He is expressly disentitled from getting reasons for the termination but he is entitled to reasons for the declaration being made under this proposed new section. That would mean that the commissioner would be perfectly entitled to give very limited reasons that identify why he regards the termination for conduct or misbehaviour being serious misconduct. It does not oblige him to disclose the reason for termination, but only obliges him to disclose the reason for the making of the declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having to work his way around that, the applicant is seriously inconvenienced, and he still has the problem that he has to demonstrate an error of law&mdash;not an error of fact, an error of law. He has no other means of overcoming the problem. The action at common law for review on the law is hampered to an even greater extent because the action of common law administrative review does not give the officer an entitlement to anything that the AD(JR) Act does not give, and in fact there is no entitlement to reasons in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference is made by the minister to the agreement between the Australian Federal Police Association and commissioner, negotiated I understand with the involvement of the ACTU. The agreement requires the commissioner to consult with the association before terminating an officer's appointment. That is unlikely, in many situations, to be a very satisfactory solution. For a start, there is no guarantee that the officer will be a member of the association, which may not therefore have an interest in pursuing his case. Secondly, in the scenario I painted, other officers may have been involved in setting up the dismissed officer, which might affect the consideration that the association would give to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the association itself has no means of undertaking an investigation and may have no means of putting a case to the commissioner on behalf of the dismissed officer. That is the likelihood. In the light of that, any deficiencies in the safeguards in the bill will not be solved by being wallpapered over with an agreement which is neither contained in nor referred to in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an annual reporting requirement: the commissioner is required to report to the minister. This is a valuable monitoring tool but it is at best a general safeguard against improper use of the broad dismissal power and will not affect an individual case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are dealing with deficiency, there is a question arising in the drafting. Section 26F(1) provides that, if a person is retired under section 26E(2)(b) and that has arisen `because of his or her conduct or behaviour,' then the commissioner may make the declaration that has been referred to. The commissioner's power to make the declaration is preconditioned on the dismissal being on account of this conduct or behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words in which the conduct or behaviour is defined seem to assume objectively factual conduct and not an allegation of conduct. That may provide a further hurdle to be overcome by the dismissed officer in an AD(JR) application. It may also provide an obstacle to the commissioner, whose power to make a declaration could then be set aside if the alleged conduct on which he relied was not capable of being shown to be objectively factual. But in what forum it would be shown to be objectively factual I am unable to suggest with conviction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a danger that the entire police force will become tarred with the brush of corruption as a result of the disgraceful criminal activities of a very few corrupt police, but in overcoming that problem we do not wish to affect innocent officers. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will speak briefly in closing this debate. I will take the opportunity at a later stage to give a written response to members who have taken the courtesy to participate in this debate. I should say a couple of things in relation to the speech by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise that the genesis of this legislation was not a response to the revelations which have emerged from the New South Wales royal commission. Indeed, it was an issue which was raised with me shortly after the appointment of the current commissioner, Mick Palmer, and was taken up in discussions with the AFPA. The agreement that has been referred to predates any of the revelations that have emerged in the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance that has been struck is not a balance that has been tilted because of some reaction&mdash;or overreaction&mdash;to those matters. It is in line with the agreement between the commissioner and the AFPA, which provides for the commissioner to exercise these powers in cases of serious corruption and gross abuse of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a counterbalance. Currently, in most instances police have no review rights. This legislation provides, in the generality of all matters, that there is now access to the provisions of review in the industrial relations environment. It is a package which balances the legitimate interests of ensuring that instances of major wrongdoing can be addressed swiftly and expeditiously&mdash;without having officers against whom there are major allegations, believed to be sustainable by the commissioner, still remaining in the police force, which may be the current situation under some circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to realise that there is no support whatsoever for the proposition that there be some external merit review of the commissioner's determinations in these instances. Take that instance that the member for Tangney raised, regarding somebody who has been framed. If the commissioner is unable to see through the matters that have been put to him, how unlikely is it that some member of the AAT, presented with the same evidence from five or six corrupt police setting up another officer, would be able to come to any other conclusion? Merit review in this situation is simply not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these instances there is also a need to make sure that steps are taken quickly to purge police forces of those persons who can be a canker within them. It is a view plainly reflected in the agreement between the association and the commissioner, and it is a view that the public would regard as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise again that it is not an overreaction to the New South Wales matters: the agreement predates them. There are always testy moments in my relationship with the AFPA, as is natural in these situations, but the AFPA has a long involvement in this, and in the main I would only be able to repeat what Mr Justice Wood said of it, that it is seeking to bring about an environment and culture within the AFP which is not conducive to growing any corruption. That is important and I think the public would see it as important. I understand that the opposition supports the bill&mdash;notwithstanding what I thought was the most curious speech in support that I have ever heard in my life from the last speaker, the member for Tangney. </PARA>
