<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It gives me pleasure today to table on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the results of the committee's 338th report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accrual accounting&mdash;A cultural change</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 338 is the result of the committee's review of two reports presented to the parliament by the Auditor-General in 1994. The reports were <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit report No. 32 1993-94, Efficiency audit, Accrual reporting&mdash;Are agencies ready?</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit report No. 16, 1994-95, Follow-up audit, Accrual reporting&mdash;Are agencies ready?</EMPHASIS>. The audit reports contained an assessment of whether Commonwealth agencies were adequately prepared to meet their obligations to report on an accrual basis for the 1994-95 financial year. Prior to this the majority of Commonwealth agencies had been reporting on a cash accounting basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accrual accounting has been with us for a long time and is the basis for accounting in the private sector and for government business enterprises. Accrual accounting recognises revenue and expenses in the accounting period in which they occur, which contrasts to cash accounting which records transactions when cash is exchanged. Accrual accounting therefore aims to match the costs incurred during a particular reporting period with the benefits earned in that period&mdash;a commonsense approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's interest in promoting the use of accrual concepts has a long history. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 34, The trust fund</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in 1957, the committee argued that Commonwealth bodies operating on a trust account, rather than from the consolidated revenue fund, should keep a profit and loss account and a balance sheet which should be certified by the Auditor-General. Later, in 1982, the committee recommended that cash based accounting should be eliminated as the primary basis for financial reporting by Commonwealth authorities and, instead, that accrual accounting should be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also become clear in the committee's recent inquiry into the commercialisation of public sector operations that many Commonwealth agencies, particularly those which had moved to adopt a more commercial approach to program and service delivery, had found accrual reporting and accounting to be a valuable management tool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason the committee broadened its inquiry beyond the assessment of the readiness of Commonwealth agencies to produce accrual based financial statements for 1994-95, to the uses of accrual information by the government, by agency managers and by external reviewers, to facilitate better judgments about operating performance, economic impact and the stewardship of public resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the review, the committee received evidence at public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, at which the experiences of agencies within the Commonwealth, Victorian and New South Wales jurisdictions were canvassed. As well, information was sought from other states and territories, and from New Zealand, which has been at the forefront of introducing accrual accounting for government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing the progress in the Commonwealth arena, the committee was keen to examine: the use being made of accrual-based financial information both within agencies and elsewhere; the progress being made by agencies from accrual reporting to full accrual accounting; and the assistance being provided to agencies by the central coordinating agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 338 considers at some length the uses to which the information in accrual reports can be put. In particular, information can be used to make comparisons between reporting periods and between agencies. Such information has the potential to be of great benefit to the parliament, to which agencies are held accountable, and to the public through media commentators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the financial statement guidelines be amended to require the inclusion of a range of charts and tables to enable comparisons to be made and that the Department of Finance should collect, analyse and table in parliament a consolidated series of charts and tables enabling the comparison of the performance of all Commonwealth agencies against a range of key performance indicators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To assist those interpreting accrual based financial statements, the committee has recommended that the Department of Finance should develop a professional marketing strategy directed at the potential users of agency financial statements and also that the departments of the Senate and House of Representatives develop information and training packages on the new financial reports for parliamentarians and parliamentary staff. For its part, the committee intends to write to all parliamentarians and party whips informing them of the type of accountability and performance information that can be derived from such reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that accrual information is an essential tool for modern public sector day-to-day management. Without regular access to accrual information, it is not possible to make accurate assessments of the cost of service provision, and thereby the efficiency of program performance. It is of concern to the committee that as yet only a few agencies have recognised the value of accrual information, and even fewer have taken the initiative to explore the full potential of accrual information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that, at agency level, accrual based financial management systems should be introduced and more should be done to educate managers in how to make best use of accrual information. There should also be incentives to encourage agencies to adopt the reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the government should consider providing supplementary funding to agencies to help them redevelop their financial management systems so as to provide full accrual accounting functionality and also consider making available interest free loans to help in the transition from cash based to accrual based accounting systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also received evidence that small and medium agencies felt accrual accounting had for them limited usefulness. The committee feels that the weight of evidence does not support this contention but, nevertheless, has recommended that Finance consider sponsoring a joint working party to examine and make recommendations about appropriate financial management information systems for small and medium sized agencies, and facilitate meetings of agencies with similar characteristics with the aim of encouraging them to share the costs of implementing new systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee notes that there is a basic incoherence in the Commonwealth's financial management system&mdash;funds are appropriated on a cash basis, but end of year reports are now made on an accrual basis. This, in the committee's opinion, not only is inelegant but also sends mixed messages to managers. Managers are inclined to focus on cash&mdash;it is cash they have appropriated&mdash;but the end of year accrual reports mean they are held accountable for more than just managing cash. Such a system is likely to undermine the potential of the reforms undertaken to date. The committee has recommended, therefore, that there should be a major review of the Commonwealth's system of budget appropriations to consider the merits or otherwise of requiring that budgets be prepared and appropriations made on an accrual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Report 338 concludes with a discussion of the next major accounting reform for the Commonwealth&mdash;whole of government reporting. The committee believes that preparing such reports on an annual basis would provide information of great value to cabinet, to the government's key economic advisers, to parliamentarians and to many other external users. Whole of Commonwealth government reports would help inform strategic decisions about government priorities and policies and would enable the government to better account for its use of public resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much work needs to be done in teasing out the issues surrounding the preparation of whole of government reports, and the committee has decided to maintain its involvement in this area by conducting a separate and more detailed review of the issues involved. The committee intends to report on these matters in the course of the current parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I would like to emphasise that the recent introduction of accrual reporting across the Commonwealth public sector should be seen as only one step in the reform process. The committee has found that the core sector area still retains a cultural attachment to cash accounting, and the committee believes there is a danger that the reform process will stall unless the government sets new targets beyond just accrual reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should articulate a clear vision for the future of financial reporting in the Commonwealth, incorporating whole of government reporting, accrual management and, possibly, accrual based budgeting. A statement of direction from the government would give great impetus to the tentative steps now being taken by agencies towards accrual accounting and accrual management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to express our thanks to those people who contributed to the review by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. I would also like to thank the staff of the secretariat for assisting the committee in preparing the report&mdash;in particular, Laura Gillies, Donna Christophers, Jennifer Hughson, John Carter and our hardworking secretary, Grant Harrison. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report being tabled this morning&mdash;report No. 338 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accrual accounting&mdash;A cultural change</EMPHASIS>&mdash;is a very important one. The significance of the name of the report is that it is requesting and requiring a cultural change within the Commonwealth bureaucracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note in the address of the chairman of the committee, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), that the Commonwealth Public Accounts Committee has been requiring these sorts of changes for some time. In fact, it goes back to 1957 when report No. 34 on the trust fund was tabled. The committee then argued that Commonwealth bodies operating on a trust account rather than from the consolidated revenue fund should keep a profit and loss account and balance sheet to be certified by the Auditor-General. Later, in 1982, the committee recommended that cash based accounting should be eliminated as the primary basis for financial reporting by Commonwealth authorities and that accrual accounting should be adopted in its stead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the evidence we took in this inquiry we found that there was a great unwillingness to progress much past accrual reporting into full accrual accounting. If the Commonwealth agencies that we spoke to are going to progress further, become leaner and meaner and be able to provide the information that needs to be provided to modern governments, they will have to take on board the recommendations contained within this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found that a number of agencies said that it would take four or five years to implement accrual accounting across the board. The opinion of a number of members of the committee was that these agencies should follow our recommendations, such as recommendation 1, which was aimed primarily at the Department of Finance, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Finance should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)develop a professional marketing strategy directed at potential users of agency financial statements and with the aim of promoting the use which can be made of the accrual based information contained in financial statements;</PARA>
<PARA>It should even go to the extent of providing incentives for agencies to get up and going with full accrual accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough in the public sector today to be still using cash accounting systems. Local governments have been forced by their higher authorities into different accounting standards. They have not been given the choice that Commonwealth agencies have at the moment. It is now incumbent upon the government, as a result of the inquiry that we have undertaken, to force the issue along a little bit faster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note some of the comments that the new Auditor-General has made with regard to management practices generally in Commonwealth agencies. There is a hell of a lot of room for improvement. We could be doing things far more effectively and efficiently within the Commonwealth if this cultural change were allowed to take place in those departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with pleasure that I support the committee's findings and all the recommendations in this report. It has been a good subcommittee to work on. It has been very interesting. Certainly, it is an exciting time, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, if the government, the Department of Finance and key agencies take note of the recommendations that have been made in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman said, the committee believes wholeheartedly that accrual information is an essential tool for modern public sector day-to-day management. Without regular access to accrual information it is not possible to make accurate assessments of the cost of service provision. When competitive tendering is taking place it is not a level playing field if accrual accounting practices are not implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the indications that we had from a number of agencies&mdash;that is, that they are not moving at a very rapid rate towards implementing accrual accounting. We are recommending to the government in this report that it should hurry that process along, by whatever means it wishes to use&mdash;whether it is by a carrot or a stick or whether it is by incentives or a boot along the way. Ultimately, if we implement this system throughout the Commonwealth, the taxpayers of Australia will certainly get much better efficiency and effectiveness out of the taxpayers' dollars that are being spent by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to thank the staff who worked with us on this report, headed by Grant Harrison, John Carter, Laura Gillies, Donna Christophers and Jennifer Hughson. I also commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Charlton)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to endorse the comments that have been made by the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), another member of the committee, in connection with this report. I would like to emphasise that the choice of the name of that report&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accrual accounting&mdash;A cultural change</EMPHASIS>&mdash;was very deliberate. It represents, in effect, an appeal on the part of the Public Accounts Committee and from the Public Accounts Committee to the government to ensure that a cultural change takes place within the method of accounting within the Public Service and within the public sector generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was emphasised that modern public sector management cannot be as good as it should be without a firm and observable shift towards accrual accounting. It is understandable that traditionally and historically the public sector and those heads of agencies and people responsible for management of government departments and government agencies, instrumentalities and authorities would have been preoccupied with cash. They depended, to the extent to which they were able to pursue their responsibilities, on the receipt of cash and they measured the provision of the services for which they were responsible from the outlay of cash. It is not a satisfactory management tool. The private sector has long abandoned that simplistic approach to management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also interested in some of the extensions of this particular question. At present there are government agencies which are conducting their accounting on a cash basis. At the end of the financial period they are converting that for the purpose of reporting to an accrual basis. That represents two things: firstly, an acknowledgment on their part that the government should be determined that the transition to an accrual basis for both accounting and reporting will take place; and, secondly, in some cases some degree of inertia on the part of those agencies concerning the extent to which and the speed with which they will move to accrual accounting. But it becomes even more significant than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shift to accrual accounting within government agencies will simplify, as the chairman of the committee has also indicated, the next transition&mdash;that is, towards whole of government accounting and whole of government reporting. That will be a necessary and desirable extension. Also tied up with that is the whole question of the basis upon which and the way in which the aggregate budget is determined. That needs to be determined as well&mdash;and will be determined&mdash;on an accrual basis when all of these other measures are put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the last point that I want to make. Since the end of the Second World War there have been only four occasions, apart from an estimate of a budget surplus this year, when federal governments have delivered a budget surplus. Those four occasions were four years under the Labor government during the 1980s. The important thing about this is that there have been very few occasions when the recurrent elements of that budget have not been in surplus. In fact, the bottom line deficit for each of those budgets since the Second World War has resulted essentially from the fact that there has been a deficit in the capital account or the capital elements of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that means is that successive Commonwealth governments, national governments, have borrowed to finance investment, to finance public sector infrastructure. I say: why not? Sensible people do. People normally borrow in order to finance investment. That is the essential reason for most of those deficits since the Second World War. That then reflects on the fiscal capacity, on the fiscal stringency, on the fiscal responsibility, of national governments. People say, `There's that Australian national government budgeting for a deficit again. Why doesn't it ensure that it raises sufficient revenue to meet its commitment?' Let me emphasise that we do and we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, we quite correctly have borrowed to finance investment, to finance infrastructure. If we were to have the budget divided into those two separate areas&mdash;a recurrent budget and a capital budget&mdash;it would be clearer, and people would understand better the quality and the nature of budgetary management. The particular provisions that are in the report which the chairman has just tabled are a necessary first step in the total continuum towards more effective accounting and reporting processes across the whole area of the public sector and particularly in relation to the financial management of the national government and government agencies. </PARA>

For me, I think it is a great tragedy that, given the state parliaments in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland have been prepared to put into their criminal codes an offence against incitement to racial violence, we were not able to secure the support of the opposition to impose the same provisions for the federal Crimes Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to continue with the points I was making before I was so rudely interrupted last evening by the disruptive tactics of the opposition, which continued throughout yesterday&mdash;through important questions which they say go to the heart of the economic debate, when they did not bother to turn up for the MPI, when those opposite did not bother to turn up for debate on what they say are very important provisions in the industrial relations legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member. The level of noise in the chamber is far too high. I ask honourable members to keep their conversation down. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2V5">Mr SWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted last evening by the cynical political tactics of those opposite, I was talking about remarks that had been made by the New South Wales President of the Metal Trades Industry of Australia. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Manufacturing is presently growing almost 50% faster than the overall economy . . . As a consequence, the decline in the relative importance of manufacturing in Australia has been arrested with the sector's contribution to GDP in fact rising modestly from 15 to 16%.</PARA>
<PARA>He was really saying that we have had some notable successes in manufacturing industry, and he went on to talk about the reasons why that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, he made the point that we have become more enterprise focused, recognising that competitiveness is built and tested at the level of the firm. He went on to make the point that we have built new relationships in the workplace, encouraging management and employees to share a sense of citizenship of the business with enhanced cooperation and consultation being central to this new approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then went on to point out that we have established new markets with exports of higher value added manufactures growing by an average of 15 per cent over the past five years; that we have lifted our productivity performance, with manufacturing productivity growth being at least double for that of the economy as a whole; and that we have moved to reform our approach to and efforts in training in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make these points because if you took the point of view of the opposition about the importance of this legislation you would come to believe that none of these things was true&mdash;that we were not having productivity growth and export success and that we were not more competitive. The fact is we are, and we have that point of view put by someone not from this side of the House but by the President of the MTIA of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite would have us believe that this legislation would inhibit all those achievements that he spoke about. But it does not; the opposite is the case. We have a strongly growing economy with strong productivity growth, and an increasingly competitive economy which is delivering record jobs growth on the back of record investment and on the back of competitiveness. That was all confirmed yesterday in the national accounts. I would like to quote briefly from the BT Australia summary of yesterday's national accounts, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When one looks at the National Accounts, the phrase "This is a beautiful set of numbers" comes readily to mind.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not a quote from anyone on this side of the House but from BT Australia&mdash;`a beautiful set of numbers'&mdash;and it is entirely correct. Of course, it is completely inconsistent with the analysis of the economy from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BT Australia analysis of the national accounts yesterday backs up what the Governor of the Reserve Bank has been saying for many months now. In a speech on 11 July, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discerning listeners among you will know that, even allowing for some "catch-up", five years of 3 to 4 per cent growth has a different ring to it&mdash;and certainly a truer ring&mdash;than hollow sounding throwaways, like "five minutes of sunshine".</PARA>
<PARA>The national accounts of yesterday and the sentiments expressed by the MTIA of New South Wales blow away all of the doomsday predictions that have been put in this House by members of the Liberal and National parties. The Governor of the Reserve Bank went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would be in real trouble . . . if those responsible for monetary policy decisions allowed themselves to be persuaded to follow even a fraction of the short-term swings in sentiment we see in financial markets (and elsewhere).</PARA>
<PARA>I should imagine that `elsewhere' refers to many of those doomsdayers opposite. The economy is growing fast and it is growing fast on the back of sacrifices made by Australian workers who have recognised the need to make this economy competitive. It is growing on the back of the partnership between governments and the union movement which comes together in the Accord. The Accord is delivering great benefits to Australia. It is making us more competitive. It is creating the conditions necessary to underpin the export push over the last decade. It has been wage restraint on the union side during this period which has meant that there have actually been declines in real wages, not ones that have been  particularly appreciated by the work force but ones which they have worn in the interests of overall economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we get in this House in this debate about this bill? We get calls for further declines in real wages and the abolition of the industrial relations safety net and to give increased powers to employers to basically rip away the award system. As I said before, what the Accord has done for those on the shop floor has demanded not only responsibility but sacrifice. Over the past decade it would have been possible for unions in favourable conditions to have broken ranks and exploited situations to gain benefits for their members that would have undermined the economy. They did not do that. They do not do that in the interests of job creation and the long-term economic growth of this country. If the policies put forward by those opposite would come into play, you would blow the Accord away. When you blow the Accord away, you blow away any chance of a prolonged low inflationary, high growth economy. Those opposite will blow that away. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarks I was making go to the heart of the wages policy of those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has supported two wage increases in 14 years of $16. That is $1.10 a week for 14 years. That is the attitude of the opposition to working people in this country&mdash;$1.10 a week. They support the bank fees and charges that many banks are unfairly putting on low income people in this country. If you are a low income person in this country, you would pay $24 a year if you had under $500 in an account. The Leader of the Opposition has supported wage increases of only $1.10 a week in 14 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed those opposite have been getting a bit cocky lately. When this fact is put and reput out there right around the country, you can be sure that wages will be a central element of the next election campaign. Their attitude and opposition to the safety net increases that this government has continually supported will be noted amongst working people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can opposition members claim to represent battlers? What a joke! They have supported wage increases of $1.10 a week for 14 years and claim to represent battlers! They do not. They have never supported wage increases, and they do not support the Accord. If they cannot support the Accord, they cannot deliver on growth because they cannot deliver on low inflation, and then they cannot deliver on jobs. That is the central element of the debate running up to the next election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at what has occurred in other parts of the country, we really get down to the nitty-gritty of the attitude of opposition members to industrial relations. They support Jeff Kennett's minimum wage in Victoria of $8.60 an hour. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main purpose of the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill is to change the totally unworkable unfair dismissal laws in this country which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) originally brought in under the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. They became operable on 30 March 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, there have been numerous changes to those laws. They were changed under the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2), becoming operable in June 1994. They were refined again when the regulations made under the Industrial Relations Act were changed, especially section 30B, relating to exclusion of certain employees. Today we are debating the third change to these laws, and<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the minister still has not got it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has pointed out to the government time and again what is wrong with these laws so that the laws could be changed. The minister refused in every case to accept that, but with the passage of time he has had to keep changing the laws. Of course, the reason the government are making these changes now is that it has become so embarrassing to them that they want to clear the slate before the next election so that they do not get any further flak from this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not going to work. We have had in excess of 10,000 cases filed for hearing before the Industrial Relations Court in the short 15-odd months that this legislation has been operable. If the minister would only look at the heartache and strain it has put on family businesses, the cost to these businesses and the sheer utter waste of money spent fighting these ridiculous cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all else, the legislation is inhibiting employment. Tens of thousands of workers have not been put on in jobs because of this legislation. I hear some rumblings from the other side. Even Bob Carr, who is now Premier of New South Wales, said about this legislation on 30 April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in the Federal law.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth . . . I want to revise the Federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Premier of New South Wales clearly recognises the deficiencies in this legislation. It has been strongly loaded towards the employee. Bureaucracy has overruled the merits of the case that are to be heard and there has been no regard whatsoever for the people who create the jobs, namely, the employers. That is epitomised by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he made comments such as, `Small business operators who can't make the grade should give up and get a job.'</PARA>

If he is truthful in that statement&mdash;which would perhaps be a little unusual for him&mdash;it is time this government went. That is the only conclusion you can come to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to highlight four examples of how ridiculous these laws have been. I take one example in New South Wales from journalist Anna Obrart of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. She is head of employment law at Townsend Partners Solicitors. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the driver of an LPG tanker was not accurate in filling out his employment application form. He forgot to report that he had previously rolled a truck, an accident which may have barred him from being employed as an LPG tanker driver. After he was employed, he broke the speed limit on an interstate run. He cheated by fiddling his hours. In clear breach of company policy, he did not provide his name to another driver after he had damaged the other driver's car in an accident which he had caused. He failed to turn up to a disciplinary meeting. A second meeting was scheduled. He failed to provide an excuse for not turning up at the second meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he finally did turn up, he was rude and abusive to the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>Guess what? The employer dismissed him. But what did this fellow do under this legislation? He had heard about what a lurk it was. He immediately lodged an application before the Industrial Relations Court. What did the court find? She goes on to write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The court acknowledged that the employee had lied about the hours worked and noted that the employee's attitude to work left a lot to be desired.</PARA>
<PARA>So far so good. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet, despite the many acknowledged breaches on the part of the employee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the court found that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it was the employer who was in breach&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>because of procedural technicalities, for heaven's sake. It appears that the merit of the case had nothing to do with it whatsoever. So the employee had to be reinstated to his former position despite this track record. The court has put someone out there who is an unsafe driver. The court also ordered that he had to be treated as if he had been in continuous employment when he had been sacked; therefore, he was awarded compensation in excess of $20,000. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unbelievable, indeed, as the honourable member says. Let me give an example from Western Australia. A fellow working in a funeral parlour actually mixed two corpses up. One was to be buried and one was to be cremated. He mixed them up and the wrong body was cremated. The fellow was sacked. He had also heard about what a lurk these ridiculous industrial relations unfair dismissal laws were. He took it to the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. They found that he had done the wrong thing, but the company had to pay $8,000 compensation to this employee. It is worth reading out the note on it. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An assistant at a Perth funeral parlour who was dismissed after two corpses were mixed up and the wrong one cremated has won $8,000 compensation in the IR Court of Aust. The Court heard that the cremated body was supposed to have been buried the next day, but was put in the wrong coffin. At the time the case was being heard, relatives of the two dead men were considering taking action against the company . . . for grief suffered as a result of the mix up. The company claimed the dismissed man's failure to check the identification tag on the body before both preparing it for the funeral and placing it into the coffin amounted to gross misconduct.</PARA>
<PARA>What do you tell the relatives who turn up&mdash;`I'm sorry, you've been to the wrong funeral'? They dismiss this person, and he wins $8,000 compensation under this federal legislation. That is incredible indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two cases in my electorate that I want to dwell on. They are mundane cases in some ways, not spectacular, but this is the sort of thing that is going on. A person who runs&mdash;I will not identify the name&mdash;a small family manufacturing and engineering business in one of the larger towns in my electorate contacted me about a fellow whom he had dismissed. The fellow had a bad record of not turning up when he was needed, particularly for overtime, as is required in the state award that he was working under. The fellow was rude&mdash;I will not use the words he used&mdash;to his employer. Eventually, after a number of warnings, he was dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employer contacted me about it because the employee claimed compensation under the industrial relations unfair dismissal laws. I received this letter, dated 23 January this year, back from the Senior Adviser, Ashley Mason, of the office of the Minister for Industrial Relations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since your letter was written, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia has found that your company acted within the law in dismissing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this fellow. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that this decision lays to rest many of the concerns which were expressed in your letter.</PARA>
<PARA>So far so good. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions do not prevent an employer from dismissing an employee, as I believe your case demonstrates. Instead, the IR Act simply&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress the word `simply'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">requires an employer to have a valid reason for a dismissal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as the court found that this fellow had. Following this letter, this fellow appealed again. This company had to go back to court&mdash;and they do not get their legal costs even when they win the case&mdash;and fight it all again. In his last letter to me, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the costs will run into tens of thousands of dollars</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .       . . .      . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as we are suffering financially, physically and mentally.</PARA>
<PARA>In the appeal the court found that, while they had adhered to the state law, there was a transgression of the federal law, which overrides the state law in this case, and they had to shell out on top of this another $1,300 compensation to this employee. It is madness indeed. This business is at its wits' end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that pales into insignificance compared with another case in a major town in my electorate, and again I will not mention names because I do not want to distress the people there. This business, which is a carpet and curtain cleaning business, is run by a family. There are three members in the family&mdash;a husband, a wife and a son&mdash;and they employ a full-time person plus an office girl, who works almost full time. It is a little family business, which has been in business for some decades. The business is struggling to do the right thing. It is trying to keep its head above water in the recession, because when a recession comes in the first thing you cut out is getting your carpets cleaned. They wrote this long letter to me about this person they put on. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment commenced on 24th November, 1994 . . . related to us, and over the years had helped us out casually on a few jobs, so he knew beforehand what type of work he would be doing and how our business operated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He did 7 working days intensive training, to learn how to use the machinery properly and the cleaning procedure we followed, he was then carefully watched and instructed further on what we expected each day, each job he was given was explained, he was constantly instructed regarding care of customers property and our property . . . we could keep close contact with him and be on hand for anything he was not sure of (our other van did all the more complicated jobs and most of the travelling.) he was very confident, and although we constantly revised him and reinstructed him on procedure and he was going quite well. We randomly rang customers to see if they were happy with their jobs he did, and they were.</PARA>
<PARA>One month after that, they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our first major problem happened on 22nd Dec, 1994 when he was sent to clean a lounge suite and some carpet, he didn't put plastic coasters under the timber table and caused a permanent furniture stain on the carpet, so we had to claim insurance to replace the carpet. When questioned about this he said "yes, I thought about that but thought I'd take the chance".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was cautioned on his negligence, and told to lift his effort in all aspects, as we had also found that he had started to tell lies about his jobs, times he was at the jobs etc. The second major problem was on 1st February, when he was sent to a customer's house to clean a lounge suite (we had cleaned it regularly before without problems). The customer rang us with a major complaint saying he had used his floor presprayer on the lounge suite, it was all covered in watermarks and had taken two days to dry&mdash;had never been cleaned this way before. She also had to wash her curtains and window, as he did not move the lounge away from them and they were badly watermarked. The lounge had to be put through insurance as he had permanently ruined the material and the customer fixed the curtains. (we use a small hand held spray bottle to pre-spray lounges and this was how he was trained.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When questioned about this job he had no excuse, he had been fully trained and had cleaned quite a few lounge suites before, using the right procedure. He was given a second warning regarding his job, and although he settled down again, he still continued to lie about what he had done and we constantly had to check up on him. Including changing his equipment out of the new van into an older van as he was bumping into things and not looking after the new one no matter how much we requested him to take more care, and it was not 12 months old.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To survive, as the member says. The employee took some time off at this stage and, when he came back, they say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the employee's first 5 jobs after that resulted in 3 of them being call backs for bad workmanship. One of them for once again overspraying a lounge and marking the wall. We warned him again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the third major warning&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">about his work performance, but he did not seem to care . . . We felt he wanted us to dismiss him, and was pushing for this . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our third major problem came when we received a complaint from a customer from where he had cleaned a lounge suite on 3rd May. It took a while for her to let us know as it was her parents' house, and they were away, we tried to fix the problem but the facts are, he once again used the floor pre spray (in blatant defiance to instructions) on her parents' lounge suite, he didn't pull it out from the wall, he didn't wipe over the wet timbers immediately, but left it to the customer, when it was his job to do it, and completely disregarded every instruction he had been given repeating the same mistakes he made 1.2.95 only worse. We could not put this one through insurance (we felt they would wipe us if we did as it was the same operator, for the third claim&mdash;and an actual repeat of the same error from the second claim&mdash;we have only had one claim in 11 years before this, and that was for a mat that went out of shape and was disregarded as a carpet manufacturers fault not ours when it was settled.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wall has to be repainted (had just been painted that week) the lounge timbers have to be sanded back and restained and part of the lounge replaced. And the lounge recleaned as he didn't even pull it away from the wall and clean the back. All up it is going to cost us over $1,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, for that job. They talk about another instance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the same day, 25th May, when he was asked to talk to one of us about the situation one last time he just said "cut the crap, I'm leaving any rate, I'm not happy with the job and I haven't been happy for months." We also discussed that he hadn't been doing his jobs properly or looking after his van &amp; equipment properly. It was mutually decided he would leave in a week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were many more complaints and incidents involved but I have TRIED to cut it to the quick.</PARA>
<PARA>They then go on to talk about the new operator who started up the next day when it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . discovered that the machine had been overfilled with oil, and if this hadn't been found out it was very probable that it would have blown the oil seals on our new machine and ruined the motor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we had a meeting and decided even though the employee only had 3 more days with us, we felt he couldn't be trusted, he could do untold damage to our equipment with a flick of the wrist. Or in helping on a job with the new employee he could damage some other customer's property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We rang the Department of Industrial Relations award advisory service, explained the circumstances and asked if we were in our rights to dismiss him immediately, we were advised we had the right to dismiss him immediately&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which they did. But they then go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his brother works in this field for Telecom in Sydney and is well versed in the law regarding dismissal rights and we felt that every action&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that he has taken&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has been calculated so he could bring this claim against us . . . </PARA>
<PARA>which he has done. I will not go on about the other things but they say they could list further misdemeanours and other things that he had done wrong. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are a small business, in the country and our business is reeling under the recession set back and now the drought. We are not whingeing about this, but coping and trying to improve our business and fighting back. But, when this type of thing happens, some questions need to be asked. Where are our rights as Employers and owners of our business to protect our livelihood and what we have worked for all our lives. If he wins his claim against us and is awarded any amount of money, it will be the "proverbial straw that broke the camels back" and a family business that has been built up over a period of 11 years will no doubt demise. We are only just holding our head above water now.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been to reconciliation. They tried to steer him in the right direction there, but he would not settle. He wants six months compensation pay for his dismissal. It now has to go to the Industrial Relations Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This little company which now has a $30,000 overdraft against the bank&mdash;I rang them yesterday to check where it was up to&mdash;has run up thousands of dollars of bills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill amends the Industrial Relations Reform Act in four specific ways. They are as follows: first, an application with respect to alleged unfair dismissal has to commence now in the Industrial Relations Commission rather than the Industrial Relations Court with the obvious intention of ensuring that a number of cases are resolved by amicable agreement at an early stage and therefore minimal cost to both parties is ensured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is now specified that the Industrial Relations Commission can by agreement between the parties have  binding arbitration in a particular case. In other words, the parties have the capacity to minimise their costs by having a decision made, which is binding on both by their agreement, by the commission rather than the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, amendments are being made to ensure that the legislation does not apply in state jurisdictions where the state laws have adequate remedies for employees who have alleged unfair dismissal. Finally, in dealing with the matter the Industrial Relations Court has to consider all of the circumstances of the case both procedural and substantive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it ironic that the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) in his contribution was referring to a case in which clearly the predominance of procedural considerations was the basis on which the court made its decision&mdash;that is, the truck driver case. That is the very problem one of these amendments is designed to cure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the legislation, as it will now stand, where you do have some degree of procedural failure or procedural unfairness on the part of the employer, it will not be sufficient by itself to found an unfair dismissal case. The question of the substance of the issues involved, what the employee has done and whether they have come up to scratch will still be considered. I think that is a very important and worthwhile change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues in this legislation and the amendments ultimately go to the core of the question of power in our society and to the issue of whether the employment contract is to be deemed in our society to be just another contract or whether it is to be seen for what it is; namely, one of the foundation stones of the social structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long line of both common law judicial interpretation and statute law in English speaking countries on the question of the rights of employees in respect of their work and on the questions of unfair dismissal and remedies that employees who have been arbitrarily or capriciously dismissed by an employer have. The first major case, which established the common law position with respect to unfair dismissal, was the Adami case in 1909 in England. From memory, that was a case determined by the House of Lords. It was held that the maximum damages an employee can obtain for unfair dismissal is the term of the contract. In other words, if you are hired on a weekly basis, if you are paid weekly, then if you are dismissed by your employer unfairly the best you can obtain at common law in damages is one week's pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At contract law in common law, there are two remedies historically: damages and specific performance. It was also held in this case and other cases that specific performance of an employment contract is not going to be awarded by a court. These are decisions that have very heavily influenced the common law in this area in Australia. The reason given&mdash;I think this illustrates the flaw in the traditional common law position with respect to employment&mdash;is that to have anything else could ultimately lead to a quasi slavery position. In other words, if you have an employment contract that the employee wants to get out of by resignation or whatever, and the employer wants to continue, to allow the employer to specifically enforce the contract against the will of the employee would effectively be slavery. The employee does not wish to work for that employer any more, but the employer would be able to force that employee to do so. The reality of that, of course, is that such a situation is fairly unlikely to arise. The reverse situation, that of an employee who wants to continue to work for an employer and the employer who wants to get rid of them, of course is infinitely more common. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This illustrates the basic weakness in the common law position, which is ultimately the reason you have to have legislation with relation to unfair dismissal. Implicit in the common law position, as one would expect, with its origins in 19th century British liberalism, is the notion that the parties to an employment contract are equal, that in reality, in the practical real world that we live in, the employee and the employer are equal. There are some instances where that is true, but they are, in real terms, a relatively small minority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the vast majority of cases in employment contract situations, the power is predominantly with the employer. If any members of the House would like to discover the reality of that, then they should just go out, as I have done as a union official, and start representing them because you learn very quickly that the real power in the employment relationship is almost always with the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you have a situation where the law treats the two as nominally equal when in fact they are not, the end result is that the law does not mean very much and the protection it offers to employees is minimal. That was the case with British and Australian common law for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attempts to restrict the employer's untrammelled right to hire and fire have been at the centre of the battle between labour and capital since the industrial revolution. It is notable recently that we have seen an American entrepreneur, Jack Simplot, take over some Australian companies and make statements with respect to his desire not to employ anybody who was a cigarette smoker. It was interesting to see him on TV the other day saying, `I'll hire who I like.' In other words, there is no possibility for anybody else&mdash;the society at large, the labour movement, the government&mdash;to say, `No, there are certain rules about how you hire, when you hire, who you hire and the like.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That reveals the real bottom line position of employees generally; that is, the employer does not want any restriction at all on their power to decide who will be working for them and who will not be working for them. Employers basically oppose any form of unfair dismissal protection for employees. The great difficulty in this matter, in reaching some sort of sensible and balanced unfair dismissal legislation, is that the government and the labour movement are negotiating with forces in our society that do not acknowledge that there should be any unfair dismissal protection at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the big problem. It is very hard to have dialogue on an issue with a force that does not even accept that what you are talking about should exist. If you want an illustration of this, just look at Victoria. Until 1983 there was no unfair dismissal protection at all in Victoria. The federal system was hopeless because of the former Liberal Attorney-General, and subsequently Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, and some of his more legally creative interpretations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, it was deemed that there was no right of a federal award employee to take an unfair dismissal case, because, after that person had been sacked, he or she was no longer an employee and the employer was no longer the employer&mdash;they were an ex-employee and an ex-employer. Because, under section 51(xxxv) of the constitution, an industrial dispute had to involve an employee and an employer, there was no longer any industrial dispute because it was now a dispute between an ex-employee and an ex-employer. That is a classic example of conservative sophistry designed to produce a particular outcome&mdash;namely, no rights for workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian system that was introduced by the Labor government was not flash. It had substantial weaknesses. For example, I was involved in a case brought in July 1991 by five employees of Coles New World who were sacked essentially for union activities, for standing up for their rights. That case was taken on behalf of them by their union&mdash;by me&mdash;to the Victorian Industrial Relations Commission. Now, four years later, we are still waiting for a decision. I could cite examples of matters which I litigated in the Victorian commission in 1987&mdash;when I was first a union official&mdash;which had still not been decided when I left the clerks union in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of cases in that jurisdiction were settled between the parties for very small sums&mdash;a week's pay, two weeks pay, changing the dismissal to a resignation and the like: things that, in the vast majority of instances, were a minor fleabite to the employer, with very little reward for the dismissed employee. Since the election of the Kennett government, that admittedly inadequate system has virtually been gutted. That is the reason why we need federal legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This act was introduced to ensure that all workers in Australia have the ability to seek justice if they are arbitrarily or unfairly dismissed. This is the second time that the legislation has been amended. We have heard all sorts of wild rhetoric about backflips and things like that when in reality what is happening is finetuning based on experience. Experience has demonstrated that, yes, procedural matters have let cases succeed when, on the merits, they probably should not have succeeded. Therefore, there is a need for amendment&mdash;surely a sign that the government is closely monitoring the legislation to ensure that the balance is kept at an appropriate level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 9 June of this year approximately 10,000 applications had been issued, of which 7,300 had been concluded. Ninety per cent of those had been settled by agreement between the parties. If my experience in earlier unfair dismissal matters is any guide, the vast bulk of those will have been settled for pretty small sums of money&mdash;some of them for no money at all but for things like changing the dismissal to a resignation. Of those that have been contested, the worker has won 276, the employer has won 217 and in a further 194 cases the employee has withdrawn the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably true to say that there have been a few isolated decisions that have been rather peculiar, but I caution members to be very careful about listening to one side of the argument. We had from the honourable member for Parkes a very evocative and interesting account of a couple of cases, and at first blush some of those things can sound a bit disturbing. But you should always be very wary of judging any matter until you have heard both sides of the argument. For example, in the case of the funeral parlour employee, questions come into my mind about procedures, training and a variety of other possible issues which could explain the events that occurred. Obviously what happened is very shocking, but just to assume that it was his fault, without having heard anything on his behalf, would be a grave mistake. It is very easy to scare people about these issues but we should be very careful about making judgments about any individual case without having actually heard the alternative point of view&mdash;as presumably the court or the commission did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core issue in this is the nature of the work and employment relationship in our society. In my view and in the view of people on this side of the House, workers have some form of equity in their jobs. They determine in most cases where they live, their living standards, their social relationships, their self-esteem and their standing in the community. They are the dominant part of people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For most people, the employment contract is, after the family, the most important part of the social framework in their existence. So it is natural that they want to struggle to assert some degree of power or some form of control over that relationship and to preclude the other party in that relationship from having completely untrammelled arbitrary power to just dismiss them at a whim for no valid reason whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment contract, in the view of people in the Labor Party, is different from a contract to buy a loaf of bread. That is the difference between the two parties. The Liberal Party's view is that ultimately they are the same thing; it does not matter. They believe that it is a contract between two equal parties but, if there is unequal economic power, so what!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences for an individual worker of an arbitrary dismissal can be extreme. They can receive a black mark against their name for having been sacked. In some cases, workers because of age may find it difficult or impossible to get another job. They can experience separation from their friends in the workplace and the social network that is usually built up around work. There will obviously be a loss of income and potential unemployment for a serious length of time. Why should an employer, without any form of recourse to an independent umpire or a proper decision making authority as to whether or not the dismissal was done fairly and properly, have the arbitrary power to remove these entitlements from an employee?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at the line that we get on these issues from the coalition. Ultimately, this issue demonstrates that the coalition is a class based party: it is a party of employers; it is a party of the better off; it is a party of the wealthier elements in our society. Also, this issue demonstrates that the coalition's claims to represent battlers in our community are hollow and hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not heard in this debate what form of unfair dismissal regime the coalition would support. It is fairly easy to criticise and say, `Yes, you got it wrong here and there,' but have they come out and said, `Look, here's the unfair dismissal system that we would propose; here's the system that we would operate under; these are the rights we think workers should have'? No, they have not. Why haven't they done that? Basically, they and the people who support them do not agree that workers should have any unfair dismissal rights at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Political pragmatism at both state and federal level will probably mean, as it has with the Kennett government in Victoria, that those opposite cannot absolutely and totally destroy an unfair dismissal regime, but they will try to gut it from within; they will try to leave a sham, a shell, a facade, which gives the appearance of some rights but which in reality removes most of the them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said&mdash;apparently the New South Wales Premier has concurred with this&mdash;that the unfair dismissal legislation has impacted on employment. These sorts of claims are very hard to test. If you look at the critical test of what sort of employment growth we have had since the act has been in force, you would have to question those claims. Clearly, we have had very high employment growth since the unfair dismissal legislation has been in force. So there is not much evidence, apart from anecdotal evidence, of the unfair dismissal legislation restricting employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to concede that there probably are instances where individual employers have not employed somebody because they are frightened about potential unfair dismissal cases. But, in those cases where it has happened, is it because of the content of the legislation or is it because of the hysterical scare campaign that has been run by some employer organisations and the coalition on these issues? What you have had is a gross monumental beat-up of the threats to small employers, medium sized employers and the like in respect of this legislation to the point where, if any decision has been taken by individual employers not to employ because of the legislation, I would suggest that it is not because of the substance of the legislation; it is because of the scare campaign that has been run by the conservative forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are arbitrarily dismissed, why shouldn't you have the right to have some form of umpire's decision about whether you have unfairly had removed your livelihood&mdash;your social network, your self-esteem and your capacity for future employment? In the vast majority of cases, the workers do not get their job back and they often get very limited compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues are, in a sense, a broader window into the industrial relations policies of the coalition. In an era when massive international change is occurring, the profit share in the economy is back to the highest levels on record and wages have been restrained, they want more power for the employers. They do not just want the employers to get what they are getting now and workers' power in society to be what it is now; they want the shift to occur even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Change is happening in a variety of ways in industrial relations. Enterprise bargaining has emerged because of changes in the structure of production in the workplace. In the past, awards that covered thousands and thousands of people were appropriate vehicles to deal with contract of employment issues across a very wide range of people, workplaces and the like. But diversity in the workplace and the production process means that those issues often now have to be dealt with at a more micro level. That is why that change is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is managing that change, ensuring that reasonable rights for workers are retained, that the imbalance in power between employees and employers is not exacerbated, and that there is a safety net which ensures that basic social protections are provided for people who are economically and industrially weaker. That is evolutionary change. It involves ensuring that those who are weaker are protected. The Liberals want to tear away the safety net. They want to make sure that employers have untrammelled power, economically and managerially, and unfair dismissals are the sharp end of their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, with regard to the suggestion that unemployment is higher in Australia because of the regulated labour market, we need only have a comparison with the United Kingdom, where there is a totally deregulated labour market, bodgied unemployment figures to minimise the number of people who are unemployed, and unemployment levels that are roughly the same as Australia's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comparison with New Zealand that is often made by the coalition misses one critical point&mdash;that in the last few years in New Zealand, starting under the Labor government and subsequently under the National government, the real incomes of different levels of society have diverged enormously. They carry on about the gap between rich and poor in Australia. If they want to see a real problem on that front, they should look at New Zealand. The key thing that has been brought about by the sorts of policies they support in New Zealand has been a massive increase in the gap between lower paid workers and people who get a better reward for their labours. I commend the legislation to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speeches made by such persons as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), who was, of course, a career trade unionist prior to becoming a career politician, are always made with a very limited understanding of the genuine problems and, for that matter, aspirations of working people, which many small business owners get to understand in a very interesting way. These people do not have academic backgrounds. They are not lawyers. They are just ordinary people who have frequently started in a job with other workers and, through their energy and savings, have advanced to owning their own small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind you&mdash;it is a pity the member for Melbourne did not hang around for a minute&mdash;of the remarks of one of the most respected Labor politicians in recent years, Kim Beazley Sr. He said that when he joined the Labor Party it represented the cream of the working class, and when he left it it represented the dregs of the middle class. They are not my words; they are the words of one of your more respected and long serving members in this parliament and, of course, a minister in his time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts are that people who run small businesses in particular, and people who are really suffering from the impact of this foolish legislation, are people who were working people, who were wage and salary earners and who earned it at the coalface&mdash;not as school teachers, not as university lecturers, not as professional trade unionists. Of course, something like 14 of the last 18 Labor members to come into this House came from that sector. That is no doubt the reason that Kim Beazley Sr felt inclined to make those remarks on his retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those ordinary working people who have elevated themselves to this dreadful&mdash;according to the member for Melbourne&mdash;category of employer have a very good understanding of the aspirations of their work force. They also are keen to employ and retain them. There is no class distinction; there is no boss-worker attitude there. In fact, I would defy the few present here today to walk into the average small business and instantly identify the boss. He or she frequently looks very similar to, dresses very similarly to and works at the same rate and in the same work and safety conditions as everybody else employed there. If you spot someone in long socks and neat grey shorts, you can bet that he is not the boss but the visiting salesman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You create this farrago that the boss always hates you. The simple fact is that, while you can convince workers of that, you, the trade union official, have a job and you stay in the job. It is not like that in the workplace. In so many small businesses I know, it is a fact that the employers go down to the pub for a drink with their blokes after work. I have served beer in that situation over 20 or 30 years. Unlike your legally qualified previous speaker, the member for Melbourne, I as a hotel keeper used to spend most of my time mixing with them. I know how they think and I understand their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you this: when those sorts of people move from being a worker to an employer, they have learnt one thing very clearly&mdash;good workers are still hard to find. Good, reliable staff who can go and do a job on their own are hard to find. When those people are found, employers stick to them like glue. The great tragedy in any small business is the day one of those people tells you they are leaving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting thing in this argument about people's rights to compensation is that nobody&mdash;bar me&mdash;has ever stood up in this place and said, `What about the boss?' A boss takes on someone, who frequently has limited skills, and trains the person in the business. During that period, the boss may not get the level of production that warrants the salary that the arbitration system dictates, but does it and eventually builds these people up to the point where someone else recognises their value and takes them away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot blame individual employees for improving themselves. That is what the Liberal Party is all about. But it is amazing that when the boss walks up to someone and says, `I have got to let you go'&mdash;maybe because the bank manager rang him that morning and said, `If you don't reduce your payroll, I will bounce your cheques'&mdash;he is a villain and he should pay compensation. Take a look at the reverse procedure where a valued employee wanders in one day and says, `I am leaving.' From my experience of years ago employees have said, `I'm going up to the next town 600 miles up the track; I think I have had enough of working for you.' You say, `But there is no work up there,' and they say, `We know that, but we have saved a bit and we can get on the dole when we get there.' Why is it that in that circumstance, if this principle properly applies, there is no compensation for the boss?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You laugh at that prospect because bosses are nasty; they are dreadful people&mdash;notwithstanding the fact, as I have pointed out, that half of them started as employees and took that giant step, usually mortgaging their houses and their families' future. Very few people start their business the day they turn 18. They simply start in a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are never compensated when their valued employees leave. The simple point I want to make is that there is not a boss in existence who comes to work in the morning with a sneer on his face thinking to himself, `Who can I sack today?' and who does not have grave concerns for his employees. That is the other problem&mdash;the member for Melbourne has probably never had to sack anyone in his life. It is a very difficult thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joke is that there was a rule that employers had to confront the individual personally&mdash;it was a convention&mdash;and tell them they were leaving. It was considered totally improper to send them a letter through the mail saying, `Don't come Monday.' In small business that was an absolute no-no, but these laws make it obligatory. That is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything in these laws is designed to widen the gap between employer and employee. Let me give you an example that occurred in the last couple of months in a business run by my son and elder daughter. This bloke was actually promoted. It was the worst thing we could have done for him. I say `we' because I talk to my kids and they tell me what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within a short period of time in his new position, and contrary to written standing orders, this bloke left a cash register in a very exposed position, with the key in it, and, around the corner in a rather exposed office, he left the lid off the floor safe. Both were unattended. He had obviously done it before because the guys that came in and scooped the money out of both of them&mdash;about $3,000&mdash;did not waste any time. We possibly could have made the allegation that he was involved. Was he sacked for that? No, he was not. He was counselled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, in another aspect of his responsibilities, he allowed people conducting retail outlets associated with the business to purchase goods that were in stock in the wholesale establishment. He knew about it because that is where he was. It hit the cash flow of that business to the tune of about $150,000. Was he sacked for that? No, he was not. But it became obvious&mdash;this is the new rule&mdash;that it was time to write him a letter and ask him to lift his game, and that is what they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They put down in writing the matters about which he had been counselled. His performance did not improve in a general sense and, lo and behold, through his negligence, a brand new lawnmower was stolen out of the place that was under his control. That was the last straw. They dismissed him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They took advice. They had followed due process. They got to the arbitration commission, where the commissioner said, `You have the opportunity to go on to the court but let me advise you that you will lose. Count yourself lucky and just pay this person.' The previous speaker made the comment that these payments are always small amounts. This was a month's wages, some thousands of dollars, and that is not small bickies in a small business, particularly when you have not got it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner advised that this matter be settled after he put this question to my two children: `In the process of giving him all these verbal warnings, did you threaten him with the sack?' They said, `No, we just consistently drew his attention to the fact that he wasn't doing the job he had been employed for.' They gave him evidence of some pretty serious breaches but he said, `If you didn't threaten him with the sack each time, by due process you have lost.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine the typical small business person, walking around their establishment with two or three employees and seeing them doing something wrong&mdash;they might just be breaching their own safety rules. It would be no good him saying, `Johnny, don't do that again. Please lift your game. Please be more careful.' He has to add, `If you don't, I'm going to sack you.' What would the atmosphere be in that sort of workplace? What decent employer would want to conduct themselves in that fashion? It is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are with a piece of law that says, `Don't communicate verbally with anyone; don't just quietly sit them down and tell them that you think they need to improve their effort this way and that way. Write them a letter and threaten them with the sack.' That is your legislation, not ours. I find that outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go from the outrageous to the stupid. I got a phone call the other day from a constituent who runs a roadhouse. That person employed a female casual operative on weekends. She rang up during the week and said, `Listen, boss, I can't come on the weekend; I'm otherwise engaged.' He said, `Okay, you're a casual; thanks for giving me a couple of days notice. I'll get somebody else.' And he did. The following week she rang again and said, `I can't come this weekend either.' He said, `Okay, I'll get the girl I got last weekend.' Then she rang the third consecutive week with the same message. He said, `Thanks very much for ringing again. The other girl's doing a good job.

It is just ridiculous. It is creating an atmosphere in the workplace that is outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Melbourne also quoted the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, who said publicly, `This legislation is impacting on employment.' The honourable member for Melbourne does not really want to know about that, so he queries the statistics. Let me give an example that was brought to my attention of how that works in terms of people in employment. If you get a group of people working at a particular job, you might have a problem with one of them, maybe the most senior. You go and take advice and they say, `There is no way that you can sack that person; they would take you to the cleaners under the existing unfair dismissal law. Let me tell you how to get out of it. Sack everybody in the department and outsource the operation. That then becomes a restructuring. You are entitled to do that. You can restructure and outsource in a fashion that is entirely different from what you have now and you achieve whatever efficiencies you want and you get rid of this person or persons.' But that might mean six people lose their jobs when the target is only one. That too comes under the category of the stupidity of this legislation, and that is what is now happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can you remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, how many years ago the word `outsourcing' had never been heard of and never mentioned in this parliament? Why do you think it has happened? It has happened because of the government's legislation. Outsourcing was not a word of the Fraser government; outsourcing is a word that was always in the dictionary but to which you people have given a special meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proves another point. In the end, whatever your tax laws, whatever anything else that is unfair and wrong, people will find a way around that. We will be back in here soon wanting to pass legislation that says that you are to outsource only half your business or some other rubbish, because outsourcing is also not very smart from the point of view of trade union bureaucrats. Very few outsourced staff join a union. They are killing their own business, but they have been doing a very good job of that for a long time. You only have to look at the figures. The public sector has 67 per cent union membership, and what is it down to in the private sector, where people have a little more choice? Twenty-seven per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions are starting to offer overseas holidays to people who join. They are saying, `Come join us. Have an overseas holiday.' Is that why you join a trade union? You would think they were Coles. But workers will not be had. I think Deakin University recently did quite a comprehensive survey of workers and their attitude to trade unions. Forty-seven per cent of them said, `We are in a trade union because that is the only way we could get the job. We have no faith in the officials. We do not want their help, but we had to buy our job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is Australia&mdash;the country, as noted this year in Australia Remembers, which was fought bitterly for by the now older people in our community. We fought not only to defend this bit of real estate; we fought to defend a few values. I always thought one of those was that, if you wanted a job and someone was prepared to give it to you, you ought to be able to have it without some restriction, like paying up to get through the front gate. It is about as un-Australian as bowling underarm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts are that this legislation will improve things a little bit but, with the examples I have given you, I can assure you it is reducing people's opportunities to get jobs, it will reduce trade union membership and it is very foolish. Let me say in closing&mdash;this has been referred to&mdash;of course people should have access to an independent umpire if action is brutal and unfair, but it has also got to be fair to both sides. In the examples I have given, clearly the employer had a right and in fact the employer should have been able to go. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The words that are proposed to be omitted by the opposition are all words after `That'. That means the entire legislation. That does not make a great deal of sense to me. The four members of the opposition who so far have spoken in this debate have recognised, rather belatedly I think, that this legislation represents improvements to the industrial relations legislation as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill will amend six acts, some of those amendments represent purely technical changes. Some of them are of moderate importance. Perhaps the most important are those amendments which concern unfair dismissal. If I have time I also want to say something about one provision of this legislation about which I am concerned, and that is the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened as much as I could to the contributions made by the four members of the opposition who have so far spoken in this debate: the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I am not going to say, even though on some occasions in relation to some of the observations and comments they made I may have been tempted to, that they sounded like rednecks in connection with industrial relations and their attitude towards employees. I stop short of saying that. Let me say that on occasions some rednecked sentiments were expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one denies the fact that there are difficulties in the whole area of industrial relations of one kind or another. The very fact that governments enact legislation in an attempt to deal with some of those questions indicates that there are problems and inadequacies. Legislators and governments have a responsibility to review those inadequacies and attempt to do something about them&mdash;especially when one of the fundamental issues involved is one of equity, is one of civilised behaviour, is one of mutual respect and is one about the way in which human relationships and humane relationships should exist between people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and others could have been forgiven, in connection with some of those comments made, for believing or thinking that Australia still remained in the period when we had masters and servants. We no longer live in an era when we talk about masters and servants, thank you very much. One of the fundamental principles by which the International Labour Organisation carries out its responsibilities is that labour is not a commodity. No, labour is not a commodity. Let me assure members of the opposition and the wider community that, while democratic socialist parties like the ALP are in government, those governments will not tolerate any arrangements which may view labour as a commodity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been made about the fact that there have been 10,000 of these unfair dismissal examples brought to the industrial relations process&mdash;10,000 out of a total employment of wage and salary earners in Australia of 8 1/2 million. So you can throw off a figure such as 10,000. The implication of that is that most of them are vexatious, unreasonable or fraudulent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me indicate what those 10,000 matters represent. Over 10,000 matters under the unlawful termination provisions of the IR Act had been filed with the court by 9 June this year. Approximately 7,300 had been finalised. Only seven per cent of the applications, however, were dealt with by the court. These figures contrast with a total of 452 other matters&mdash;matters not related to unfair dismissals&mdash;that were lodged with the industrial court by 29 May this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the approximately 7,300 matters concluded, over 90 per cent of them were either settled or discontinued. Of the contested matters determined by the industrial court, 276 have been decided in favour of the employee and 217 have been decided in favour of the employer&mdash;that is about 500 out of the 10,000 matters we have heard so much about. In terms of settlement, they have been evenly divided between employers and employees. It does not take me a great deal of intelligence to try to assess what message members of the opposition are trying to convey. I will say something more about that almost immediately. In 86 cases the employee abandoned his or her application and in 108 cases the employee simply failed to appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I would deal almost immediately with some of the attempts that have been made to convey certain attitudes towards this legislation. I said there were redneck attitudes towards employees. Yes, there were. But members of the opposition attempted to give the impression that they were being so calm, so dispassionate, so objective and so fair. Were they indeed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of those 10,000 cases, we have heard examples from members of the opposition of what they consider to be, I suppose in a sense, aberrations in the whole area of industrial relations. There cannot be too many of them. Let anyone go through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. There cannot be too many cases, because most of the speakers repeated the same cases. What did they refer to? They referred to examples of theft. They referred to examples of lies. They referred to examples of sloth. They referred to examples of dishonesty, of misrepresentation, of abuse, of absenteeism, of assault and of sexual harassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is fairly clever. If you want to discredit something which is designed to protect the nature of the relationship between employer and employee, pick out a few particular cases that you think can be used to misrepresent that legislation and to discredit it. How better to discredit legislation than to say, `Now, here is a person who thieved from his or her employer and had to be reinstated.' There were 10,000 cases&mdash;and I have indicated what happened with those 10,000 cases&mdash;out of 8 1/2 million wage and salary earners in Australia. If the implication of the comments and the contributions that have been made is that workers in Australia are thieves and liars and are slothful, dishonest people who misrepresent and abuse their employers, who are deliberately absent, who molest others, who sexually harass and who assault, I reject it absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned as well by others&mdash;these are those same people who have been drawing our attention to some of those particular cases where, in order to amass sufficient information to fill a speech of 20 minutes, they had to repeat examples which were given by some of their colleagues&mdash;that during the last 14 years, and this better than perhaps anything else indicates their attitude towards the welfare of employees in Australia, they have&mdash;that is, members of the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;supported only two wage increases for employees in Australia. Those wage increases represent $1.10 per week. That means that, if the opposition had had its way over those 14 years, the wages and salaries of wage and salary earners in Australia now would be $1.10 higher than they were 14 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the comments being made about the battlers. We have heard members of the opposition talking in passionate, concerned tones about the battlers. Let me make it perfectly clear, if it needs to be made clear: there is one political party in Australia in a position of political responsibility which shows any continuing concern for the battlers, which has put into place whole structures of legislation and arrangements to make sure that this country we live in is a civilised country, with civilised relationships, civilised rights and civilised entitlements, as well as civilised responsibilities. That is the Australian Labor Party, and no other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not try to convey the impression that Australian workers are thieves and liars, that they are slothful and dishonest, that they misrepresent and abuse their employers, that they are regularly absent from their workplace, that they molest and assault others and that they sexually harass their workmates or subordinates. I do not try to create that impression at all, because it is not true. Those who want to discredit this legislation, of course, have tried to convey that impression&mdash;but I do not think they have done so very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One member of the opposition also expressed concern that technical inadequacies in the procedures adopted by an employer to terminate the employment of an employee had brought about the reinstatement of the employee. In some sense, members of the opposition have suggested that technical inadequacies which bring that about are a fault of the law. We are presumed to know the law. We are required to know the law and act according to it. But when it comes to a question of the law which relates to unfair dismissal, members of the opposition see the fault as lying not with those people who are presumed and expected to know the law but with the law itself. So you discredit the law because there was some technical inadequacy in the preparation of the dismissal case by the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Murderers and rapists have been released from custody, dismissed by the court as a result of technical inadequacies in the law. Workers deserve no less. Who would suggest that, if there were technical inadequacies in a case brought against an accused murderer or rapist, he should be locked up anyway? That is not the way we operate&mdash;nor should we. That is not the basis of our criminal law&mdash;and it is not going to be the basis of our industrial law either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criticism has been made also of the fact that there have been three occasions now since 1993, when the initial Industrial Relations Reform Act was enacted, on which the act has been amended. So what? We review legislation, we review the adequacy of the legislation, we look for deficiencies, we seek to find improvements and, when we identify and find them, we enact amending legislation to correct it and make it better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, that concept of unfair dismissal is completely unexceptional. Of course there are examples of unfair dismissal. As the legislation makes clear, if a dismissal is harsh, unreasonable or unjust, it is unfair. If that has the effect then of depriving a person of his or her livelihood, they are entitled to some redress; there should be remedies available. If a person has been unfairly dismissed, what are the remedies which might be available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first remedy is reinstatement. If that is not possible or practical, then the second remedy is compensation. Would members of the opposition prefer that we fine, flay or incarcerate the employer responsible for that unfair dismissal; is that your preference? So far, members of the opposition have made a lot of reinstatement or compensation. What are the alternatives? They are the only alternatives available to an employee who has been unfairly dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we should look at the employer who carried out the unfair dismissal. Perhaps instead of providing some sort of compensation or reinstatement for the employee we can provide a penalty against the employer. Oh, no&mdash;God forbid! No such suggestion has been made by members of the opposition, nor would I make such a suggestion. The sensible solution to circumstances of that kind is to provide either for the reinstatement of the employee who was unfairly dismissed or appropriate compensation. When industrial relations is enacted people who are involved in the industrial relations area have a responsibility as well to make sure they know the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite those criticisms by members of the opposition about the legislation, let me cite what some other responsible authorities and organisations have said. Ian Spicer, for example, from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, `ACCI welcomes this bill.' This is the bill from which the members of the opposition want to delete everything after the word `that'. Ian Spicer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ACCI welcomes this bill which implements the federal government's recent commitment to amend procedural fairness laws to specifically recognise voluntary arbitration by the Industrial Relations Commission in the act to provide that applications are made to the commission, not the court, and to preserve the operations of the more realistic state systems. The government has demonstrated its bona fides.</PARA>
<PARA>Ian Spicer, not Martin Ferguson, not Barry Jones, said that the government has demonstrated its bona fides by introducing this bill. The ACCI believes the bill should establish a more realistic federal framework for dealing with unfair dismissals. He also said, `The federal government has taken account of the ACCI views.' Yes, we have. We consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU supports it. Bert Evans from the metal trades industry said the amendments are consistent with proposals put forward by them. The Chamber of Manufactures said that improvements need to be made now in the handling of unfair dismissal applications. That is the nature of this legislation. It is good legislation which is based on civilised concepts about the social nature of the productive process which involves employers and employees. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to just pick up on a few comments of the previous speaker, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). He talked about the ACCI and gave the impression that it was all in favour of this. The ACCI has made some positive comments about it. They were the initial welcoming comments about the changes. That is what the previous member talked about&mdash;the initial welcoming of the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the changes, but there are still some problems with the legislation. The latest comments by the ACCI are that it has reservations about the following things: onus of proof, lack of a filing fee and a filtering mechanism, the inclusion in the act of the ILO recommendation, costs, the provision concerning absence or sickness, and the lack of power of the commission to determine applications other than on a voluntary basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether it is amnesia or selective quoting or what, but in this place we have people who want to put different points of view. Just to balance it up, I thought I should say what ACCI is now saying so that we have at least a true reflection of ACCI's position. In many respects, I come to this legislation and say, `It is about balance.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a quote earlier from one of the government members&mdash;I think it was the member for Lilley (Mr Swan)&mdash;about a sense of citizenship at the enterprise place. The people that have really encouraged a sense of citizenship at the enterprise place for over a decade now, where the employer and the employee work together for common goals to benefit the employee and the employer and the community generally, are those in the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties are the ones who started this debate off in the late 1970s by saying that it is at the enterprise level where men and women, whether they be employers or employees&mdash;it does not really matter&mdash;have to put their shoulders to the wheel and work together in harmony for everybody to benefit. It was the Liberal and National parties which really started that whole debate off, to refocus away from the confrontational position which particularly the ACTU had built up in this country of ours since, I guess, 1969 in the O'Shea case. After that, the union movement was put above the law of the country, so there was this confrontational period in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of us are glad that a lot of that is now behind us. Certainly in relation to the philosophical and intellectual debate about how we can manage our enterprises better and how we can improve interpersonal relationships between employer and employee, we are glad that is behind us. It has been the coalition that has argued that debate for a long time. Even though the enterprise situation is not fully developed in this country, at least we are moving to that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I affirm very strongly that the coalition is about having a sense of citizenship at the enterprise level, where there is that sense of cooperation and a sense of working together for everybody's benefit. I think there has to be a large degree of trust. Looking back on the way in which industrial relations legislation has developed in this country, we had it from 1904 up to 1988. The then Minister for Industrial Relations, Minister Willis, said when introducing the bill, which we are amending today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the most substantial revision of Australia's federal IR system undertaken since the system was established in 1904.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very substantial bill. One would think that if they were going to take on a huge change&mdash;he said it was the most substantial revision in 84 years&mdash;they would have really got this balance right in the mood in which Australia was then moving. But they didn't. That is why we are here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has to keep on correcting the legislation which they brought in. There has to be a delicate balance. The previous speaker for the government, the member for Charlton, said that we are arguing over minor things. He went through a whole list. I think he included things like absenteeism, lies, sexual harassment, resignations on own volition, abuse, molestation and assault.

Being honest about it, what we are really on about is that we ought to have legislation in place that makes these certain types of actions which have occurred very clear, legislation which certainly rectifies that and gives a clear message that things like, say, 2 1/2 years of absenteeism are not legitimate grounds for you to be able to come back and say that the employer has to pay compensation for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are coming to that point. We ought to have legislation in place&mdash;that is what this debate is really about&mdash;but we need to use our commonsense. We are trying to sort this out so that these ridiculous applications do not blot the system and cause great delays and expenditure. To some people, that expenditure might be minor but other people, to whom it might be a substantial amount&mdash;whether it be $2,000 or $10,000&mdash;might just say, `We'll pay compensation and get it off the agenda. We don't want to get into a court case. We don't want to argue it.' That is what a number of employers are doing, and a number of the actions that are now being taken should be able to be precluded by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody in the coalition wants to see employees ground into the dirt, but that is the impression given by the government. That is definitely not so. Our view is that getting over this huge overseas debt is dependent on Australian men and women, employers and employees, working together. That is the goal of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way in which this country can survive given the huge increase in debt caused by the Hawke and Keating governments. They have dug a hole for our future generations of Australians. There is no way out of it if we do not have good relationships at the enterprise level. That is what we are about as a coalition&mdash;making sure that the type of legislation which comes into this House gives a genuine balance. There is a great need for that balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the first one to say that there are circumstances in which employers do the wrong thing by their employees. Some employers do that, but this legislation is trying to give a balance. The legislation has gone too far one way and has allowed certain applications to come into the industrial courts which really are not legitimate. That is what we are saying&mdash;and both sides of the House, I think, would agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is that government members want to maintain credibility with the union movement. They want a harsher position on employers so that they can go out at election time, beat their drum and say, `We're fighting for you.' But the consequence for this country is that people have been kept out of jobs, and there is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you talk to employers&mdash;large, small or medium&mdash;they will always say, `Why take on the risk if you are going to have these problems?' This is just one of the illustrations they give. Other on-cost items are involved, but the employers come back and say, `One of the problems now is the very complex procedures which we have to go through if we want to dismiss somebody who, on anybody's evidence, has clearly broken the rules and is not acting in good faith in his employment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation today in Australia where our net foreign debt is $180 billion, having gone up by more than seven times in 13 years. There has been a remarkable explosion of debt. More than eight per cent of people are unemployed, yet there are niche markets in the world which many small business people and companies are operating in and could get more involved in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the real retardations for small businesses in this country is the industrial relations situation. That is only part of the problem, but it is still a part. Very few people on the government side have been employers but, if they were to go out there and speak to the 80 per cent of Australians who are employed in small business about the hindrances associated with employing a 16-year-old, a 25-year-old or a 45-year-old, they would be told, `Look, I agree that there should be a fair procedure, but I've read in the papers that people who have blatantly lied and who have stolen from a company have been reinstated. If I employ someone like that and go to the arbitration courts or the industrial courts, what will happen? They will be reinstated, otherwise I might have to pay $5,000 or $6,000. It's not fair. The best thing our family can do is to work an extra three or four hours each and not employ anyone else. We don't want to have that lifestyle, but we're not going to employ anyone while the legislation allows for these vexatious claims to be made.' It also costs the government money to have the courts, the commissions and industrial commissioners held up with these types of claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is reaffirming very strongly the fact that we want at the enterprise level a harmonious, energetic and positive relationship between employers and employees. It has to be on a fair basis. There is no doubt about that. There should be procedures through which employers should have to go if they are going to dismiss an employee, but the legislation in this parliament&mdash;this is what we are complaining about&mdash;leaves open these opportunities for people who were not unfairly dismissed to claim that they were unfairly dismissed. That is what we are saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am amused by this government's line that we have a master-servant attitude. Obviously, the polls are saying that the Labor Party has to smear the coalition as having this attitude of master and servant. Let us reflect on the decision by the Labor Party to put Martin Ferguson into the seat of Batman. Was that a master-servant attitude? The masters of the Labor Party determined who would represent the people of Batman. It is the best public example of the master-servant approach in Australia today. Who administers this attitude? The Labor government, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the whole Labor Party machine. The people who talk about master-servant attitudes are the old socialists who are still around, but they are still active. Here we have a classic example. The members of the community should have been able to select from the grassroots of their community a person to represent them. But the masters brought in the bigwigs. They rolled them into town, placed them in a house and said, `This person will represent you up in Canberra.' Isn't it marvellous to be in a debate in which this concept of master-servant is portrayed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition moved away from the master-servant attitude a number of years ago, but the Labor Party is still in it up to their eyeballs. The old socialists are still working away at it. But it does clarify the Australian people's image of the difference between the parties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. This bill will do a number of things. It will ensure that all unfair dismissal applications commence in the Industrial Relations Commission rather than in the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. It will allow voluntarily binding arbitration of claims by the AIRC to encourage non-legalistic solutions. It will allow any state system to operate which provides an alternative, adequate remedy which generally conforms with ILO convention No. 158, and it will require the court to consider all the circumstances of an unfair dismissal case in deciding whether a dismissal is justified and what remedy should be given if it is not. It goes to some other issues and I will certainly be canvassing some of those during my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to clarify that the Industrial Relations Court of Australia can have jurisdiction to enforce coal industry awards made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the combined exercise of Commonwealth and state powers. This amendment complements the amendments made by the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1994 to integrate into the mainstream industrial relations jurisdiction the jurisdiction previously exercised by the Coal Industry Tribunal. </PARA>

Unfortunately, the thinking that he was pursuing is very reflective of the frontbench. His mathematics do seem to be rather poor. Some 10,000 cases have been brought before the court, but he fails to mention that we have actually created 670,000 new jobs in the lifetime of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the government's period in office has been marked by the lowest industrial disputation in a very long time. We are also looking, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said yesterday, at the longest sustainable low inflation growth this country has experienced since the late sixties, early seventies. Of course, it suits the opposition to talk about the foreign debt and to make all sorts of scurrilous and mischievous imputations about it. We can only reflect on the nature of truth, which has been a great issue in recent days in this parliament and in the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has been consulting with all the players in a time of very rapid industrial change. You actually have to have amendments to legislation because you want to make sure that the mechanisms you put in place will work. We have consulted with all the players&mdash;state jurisdictions, the unions, employer organisations&mdash;and, therefore, have brought in a number of amendments that will seek to improve the situation. At the bottom of it, we will not put in place a set of industrial practices that effectively say to employees, `Take the contract or take the sack.'</PARA>

Two and a half years down the track, I do not know what the opposition's policy is. I do not think it has one. We have heard all sorts of warm, fuzzy noises from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the industrial relations spokesperson, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), but I am not reassured, and I do not believe the people of Australia will be reassured, by an alternative government of this country that is not prepared to have the courage of its convictions to say what its industrial relations policy will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that the coalmining communities of Central Queensland which form my constituency remember Blackwater and what the current Leader of the Opposition tried to do. No amount of posturing from the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott)&mdash;who mentioned the meatworkers in the course of an aside across the chamber, which I will refer to somewhat later in my remarks&mdash;can change the fact that this opposition is trying to minimise itself as a target for any sort of sustained analysis of what it actually stands for and is hoping to slide in at the next election on a platform of no policies and warm, fuzzy noises. It simply will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition have said&mdash;and I am sure I will be corrected subsequently if I am wrong&mdash;that they will certainly not accept any Accord arrangements with the ACTU. That is a very marked difference between the government and the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment on the key objectives of Accord Mark VIII, which has just been signed off in recent months with the ACTU. One of the reasons we now have at the end of the 1990s a fair, inclusive and socially just society that we can be very proud of is the role that the trade union movement has played in this country, both in its industrial wing and its political wing, in making sure that the rights of working families have figured in the discussions and the decisions that have been made to the benefit of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, the political wing of the trade union movement&mdash;the Australian Labor Party&mdash;has been prepared to live up to our commitments, under the ILO conventions, to make sure that the work and family related responsibilities of working people are respected. Slowly, employers&mdash;in some cases kicking and screaming&mdash;have agreed that there is some justice in the claims that we have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal has been achieved in the lifetime of this government in this area. It is therefore very disappointing to see some employer organisations steeped in industrial archaeology, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said. It is the sort of thinking that comes from the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind members of the key objectives of the Accord Mark VIII. This is the commitment from the peak employee representatives: sustainable economic growth and substantial reduction in unemployment; a lower inflation rate to ensure continued economic prosperity; enhanced national savings; a better retirement income for all workers; and maintenance and improvement of living standards. They are the key features of Accord Mark VIII which the government and the ACTU have been able to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of responsible attitude that our trade union movement has taken to important national issues. It is not the sort of thing that the opposition would ever be able to negotiate because they are coming from a completely different standpoint. I fear that in the, thankfully, unlikely event of the opposition sliding into power on the basis of no policies at all the Accord will be out the window&mdash;ideologically, the opposition could not handle such a sophisticated negotiation&mdash;and we will revert to industrial disputation. Workers, quite understandably, will seek to improve their position at the cost of a wages push that will affect inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important things that we have been able to achieve, with the cooperation and support of the trade union movement, has been to break the back of inflation. That is what will improve the outlook for the country. We have also been able to get trade union commitment to the importance of a national savings plan&mdash;something that the opposition has never been able to come to grips with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer and was advised that such a plan was necessary, he said that it was all too hard.

But nothing will change the fact that there are two parties involved in making sure that such matters do not get to the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a huge responsibility on employers to make sure that, as part of their enterprise agreements, they have effective ways of dealing with issues when employees are not measuring up to their responsibilities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go to the changes that we have put in place, particularly in relation to the coal industry, which is part of the changes that we are making in these amendments. It is fair to say that many of my constituents, who are members of the CFMEU mining division, expressed great concern about the incorporation of the Coal Industry Tribunal into the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I am sure there is still concern at the coalface&mdash;indeed, there are currently a number of disputes, subsequent to the incorporation on 1 July, happening in both New South Wales and Queensland&mdash;I am pleased to say that at the national conference, which was held six weeks after the incorporation, the general vice-president, Tony Maher, had some very positive comments to make. Justice Deirdre O'Connor was also reported at that meeting. I will quote from the September 1995 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Common Cause</EMPHASIS>. Tony Maher was talking about the first six weeks experience, indicating that perhaps employers may have overestimated the benefits of the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. He said the important thing that we can see is that it has enabled the union to `legitimately pursue protected industrial action in pursuit of enterprise bargaining agreements'. He is quoting an issue at CRA's Vickery mine. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vickery employees are the first in the history of the coal industry to have a legal strike. The reaction of the Commission has been cautious and constructive&mdash;it will conciliate the differences rather than penalise the workers.</PARA>
<PARA>The other thing that I think there was a great deal of concern about among members of the CFMEU mining division was that the former chairman of the Coal Industry Tribunal, Deputy President Duncan, would not be available to do all of the decisions. A number of commissioners and cross-jurisdictions from both Queensland and New South Wales are involved. This process was apparently working quite well. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is consistent with advice given to the union prior to the abolition of the Tribunal, that the AIRC is first and foremost a facilitator rather than a arbitrator.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will probably be at least 12 months before we can say for certain how workers will fare under the new system. The union remains extremely cautious about the system and has ensured maximum co-ordination between the national office and district officials in these early days.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very reassured to see that, in spite of a lot of reservations, the national body of the union is taking a very constructive approach to this new era in the incorporation of the CIT into the national group. At the same time, it is the responsibility of union officials and IR people at different sites to make sure that there is a constructive enterprise model, and they must educate both management and workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes that are left to me I want to make reference to the meat processing industry, which the member for Maranoa made an aside to. Here is an example of great concern to my constituents in Rockhampton and an example of how, under a coalition government, we would see the law of the jungle take over. What we have seen from AMH over a long period is an attempt to rip apart any kind of reasonable industrial position for the meat workers. Members of that work force&mdash;and, indeed, other members of the union&mdash;were very concerned about whether our industrial relations legislation was going to work to protect and support them. I personally attended hearings into the AMH dispute in Brisbane because I was very concerned to make sure that our legislation did work to protect the rights of both parties.

This is an amazing statement, a hypocritical statement, given it is being made at a time when the gap between rich and poor in this country has never been wider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of 12 years of Labor government has been that we now have close to a million people out of work and numbers of families who have been unable to find jobs for their breadwinners for several generations. Indeed, Australia is at a very difficult stage. The Labor Party has been an absolute disaster. The disaster that the Labor Party has been for this country is proven when one looks at the sad and sorry history of the industrial relations legislation and particularly at the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which is now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to amend a number of acts, including the Defence Act, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act and the Industrial Relations Amendment Act (No.2) 1994. A large number of those changes are quite minor, but the major changes relate to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 as subsequently amended and most particularly concern the unfair dismissal provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was indicated by the shadow minister, the coalition does not oppose the changes which are being made. But we have a major concern that what the government is seeking to achieve through these amendments certainly does not go anywhere near far enough. The unfair dismissal provisions were introduced as part of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. I must say that the government has rolled over already on a couple of occasions. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) claims that the unfair dismissal provisions were very important and would work, yet this is the third occasion on which major alterations have been made to what were the government's original proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fairly obvious, from what previous speakers have said, that the unfair dismissal provisions did not get the balance right. They simply have been unfair and they have acted as a brake on employment and as a disincentive to employers to take the risk of putting on an extra person. So we have a situation where the government is indeed having to back down yet again. It is really a wonder why the government leaves the minister in charge of his portfolio, given the fact that he has indicated such gross incompetence in the area of industrial relations during the time of his incumbency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, when the government was introducing the unfair dismissal provisions, it had to resort to the external affairs power because of the limitations under the constitution on the Commonwealth in the area of industrial relations. It resorted to International Labour Organisation convention No. 158. The government claimed therefore that, if Australia was to implement ILO convention No. 158, the unfair dismissal provisions which were included in the original legislation were necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, I believe, did not properly read the ILO convention and the government took only one of two alternatives open to it. The one alternative the government accepted was the one that, in effect, I believe, destroyed the balance which ought to exist in any fair industrial relations system. The convention said, referring to termination, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the burden of proving the existence of a valid reason shall rest on the employer, and/or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the competent bodies shall be empowered to reach a conclusion having regard to the evidence provided by the parties and according to the procedures provided for by law and practice.</PARA>
<PARA>The government adopted the first of these two alternatives and, of course, that means that the fragile balance which exists in any industrial relations system was tipped very much in favour of the employee. We do not support the principle that there ought to be, shall we say, all authority residing in either the employers or the employees. It is clear that we support a fair balance between employers and employees. But the government has, up until this time, supported the rights of employees at the expense of employment and at the expense of employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is now seeking for a third time to amend the law. Hopefully the government's actions in bringing these amendments into law will improve the situation. But, as I said earlier, the coalition is concerned that the government is not doing enough and that what it is doing is too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see major ongoing problems in two areas. Firstly, as I said, the government's amendments still will not fix up the legislation. Secondly, we are opposed to the use of the external affairs power to intrude on states rights and to intrude on what has hitherto been the constitutional balance. The Commonwealth had to rely on the external affairs power to implement the unfair dismissals provision. Section 51 (xxix) came to the rescue of the Commonwealth. Section 51 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a whole range of matters. Included among those matters is (xxix), external affairs. As we all know, the High Court over the years has constantly widened the interpretation of the external affairs power and now, of course, the Commonwealth can in effect tear up the Australian constitution by entering into any treaty with any tin-pot country anywhere in relation to any matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Commonwealth acquires the legislative competence to implement that treaty regardless of what was previously the domestic situation in Australia. The minister really ought to be ashamed of himself because he is someone who ought to understand that in our democracy there ought to be a division of power between the Commonwealth and the states. The founding fathers of this nation, when they drew up the constitution, brought down what was a very well worded document. Unfortunately, the intention of the founding fathers has been torn up through successive constitutional cases, with the result that the Commonwealth at the present time can acquire legislative competence in relation to any matter simply by entering into a treaty concerning that matter. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware that the coalition has quite a different approach to treaty making. Of course, under a coalition government we would not have found ourselves in the position the government currently finds itself in in relation to this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is probably helpful if I outline to the House what we will do to indicate that we will not abuse the treaty making power as the Commonwealth Labor Government has done in recent years. As a coalition we will ensure that the Australian parliament, the states and the wider community are given proper and timely involvement in international law making by Australian governments, including, where appropriate, cost-benefit analyses in terms of Australia's national interest prior to any ratification. We will also legislate to require that treaties be tabled with provision for debate in the federal parliament prior to ratification. We will also establish a treaties council as part of the Council of Australian Governments, and this initiative will be associated with a general strengthening of the consultative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will work with the states to ensure that, where possible, domestic legislation is in place prior to the ratification of treaties and we will also establish a joint house treaties committee to provide a detailed analysis of the implications of the prospective signing or ratification of an international treaty by Australia. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has also pledged that we will refer to our people's convention the question of the external affairs power and whether that ought to be amended so that the original intention of the constitution could once again take effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that the Commonwealth Labor government has had an entirely different approach. It has entered into ILO convention No. 158, pursuant to the wide interpretation of the external affairs power given to it as a gift from the High Court. If the federal Labor government had not taken this course of action, if the High Court had not interpreted the external affairs power as widely as it had, the Commonwealth parliament would never have had the legislative competence to carry the industrial relations legislation introduced to this place some time ago by the minister, and as a result we would not have been debating the unfair dismissal provisions that we are today. So we have a situation where the federal Labor government stands condemned. It has not respected our constitution and it brings in legislation which patently has been proven to have failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole idea of unfair dismissal legislation is to provide a fair go for the worker and a fair go for the employer. But one is well aware of the very many cases which have occurred in recent times which indicate that the legislation to date has failed monumentally. A couple of cases members may well be aware of really ought to be outlined again, because you cannot outline enough these particular cases. They indicate just how unfair, just how crazy, just how ridiculous the unfair dismissal provisions are as brought into the parliament by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a case involving Qantas. A male employee there obtained access to the computer booking records of Qantas to obtain the name of a female passenger. He rang this female passenger and made certain propositions to her. The management of Qantas, naturally being quite upset about this, called the gentleman in and pointed out that his access to the computer records was not for that purpose, and gave him a warning. Most people in society would believe that that kind of conduct should have been subjected to immediate dismissal, but that did not occur and this fellow was given a second chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within a few months, once again he was delving into the records&mdash;not this time of passengers, but of Qantas employees who were of the female gender.

The legislation passed through the parliament, it became law and we find crazy cases occurring, such as the one that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another one, involving a guy at the University of Queensland. He was a lecturer. Many students went to his lectures, and students, of course, want to pass their examinations. This university lecturer actually sought to exploit female students. What he effectively was doing was suggesting to the female students that if they gave him certain favours he would return the favours by giving them better marks. What happened was that this guy was sacked. I believe that he should have remained sacked but, unfortunately, he was reinstated. How on earth could anyone defend the reinstatement of a university lecturer who abused his position in this way by seeking sexual favours from female students? The result of those sexual favours, of course, would have been that he would have given them very high marks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in any reasonable society could defend this kind of action. Yet this situation has occurred under the legislation introduced to this parliament by the Minister for Industrial Relations. We have had other cases where people who have had 35 days of absence over two years without producing a medical certificate have been allowed to be reinstated. What is more, compensation has been paid when an employer sacked someone who was away for 35 days without a medical certificate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate I have had complaints from people who have put on staff members for a short term and, in some cases, the person has proven not to be the right person for the job. The employer has sought to remedy the problem, with the result that he has been hit with a major claim for unfair dismissal. One of the problems that employers have today is that legal costs are very expensive and we find that, in many cases, employees are virtually able to blackmail their employers into keeping them on staff or, rather, into encouraging the employers to make some kind of ex gratia payment to them. The result, of course, is that many employers in society these days are simply not prepared to put on staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we have close to a million people out of work it is a criminal tragedy that the industrial relations legislation of Australia acts, in effect, as a powerful disincentive as far as creating employment is concerned. Even Martin Ferguson has said that the industrial relations legislation is indefensible, yet the minister claims that the legislation we are now debating will make a good system even better. Martin Ferguson says the system is indefensible; the minister claims that it is a good system. Clearly, both of them cannot be right. So we have a situation where I believe the government stands absolutely condemned for bringing in legislation which has patently failed, legislation which is unbalanced, legislation which is not fair to the employer and to the employee. </PARA>

The European experience makes it very clear: if you make it complex for employers to vary their employment levels down the track, they won't take on the employment to start with. The federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth . . . I want to revise the federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed.</PARA>

The amendments being proposed by the government in the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill are designed to improve federal legislation governing the workplace relationship between the owners of businesses and those who choose employment in them. I commend the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) for the way that he has engaged in widespread and extensive consultations with all the constituencies that have an interest in this legislation&mdash;state governments, unions and employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take up some issues that have been canvassed by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) over this legislation. I will point out to him that one of the reasons for this legislation in the first place was the draconian industrial relations legislation brought into state jurisdictions by state Liberal governments. We know how workers in Victoria view the legislative frameworks that govern industrial relations. We have had a series of industrial relations reforms proposed by the Kennett government, and as a result workers have left that system in droves for the sanctuary of the federal industrial relations system. I contest what the honourable member for Fisher has had to say here today because these amendments do represent an appropriate balance in the competing interests between workers and employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hallmark of good government is its ability and willingness to continually refine complex legislation governing social and economic activity, and to deliver win-win outcomes for the competing constituencies in this very important area of activity. It is an appropriate time to reflect on some of the features of a good industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship between labour and capital in our economy is extremely complex and sensitive. We, as legislators, must strive for the most appropriate balance between the competing interests, and it is not easy to achieve that particular balance in every situation. One very important element of a good industrial relations policy is the way that it extracts conflict from an inherently complex and conflict-ridden relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important feature of a good industrial relations policy is the way that it stimulates changes in the workplace culture and allows both interests to change and grow in an increasing climate of trust and cooperation. A good industrial relations policy contributes to efficiency and productivity, both in enterprises and in the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the record of this government since it came to power in 1983, we see some very powerful evidence of the good features of an industrial relations system. We have extracted conflict, as much as we can, from industrial relations. If we go back to the Liberal year of 1982 when the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer of this country and had his hand on the levers of economic policy&mdash;I might add that the coalition has never had a sustainable incomes policy in this country&mdash;the working days lost per 1,000 employees was 783. What is it now in 1994-95 under the Labor government? It is 85 working days lost per 1,000 employees. That is a significant economic achievement, but it is also a very important social achievement. The Labor government has been able to bring an era of unparalleled peace to the industrial landscape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983, the government has enabled the culture of workplaces to subtly change, from one of conflict to one of cooperation. I would like to outline for the House a very important event which took place in my electorate in the past month. It involved a function at M.C.  Herd, an abattoir in the Geelong region and a very important employer. M.C. Herd recently obtained its ISO 9002 accreditation, and is the first abattoir in Australia to achieve this particular accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a magnificent achievement, not only for the company but for the meat industry, which, historically, in Victoria has been racked with division, corruption and industrial conflict. To hear the management get up and speak about the way in which they have approached the obtaining of this ISO 9002 quality accreditation warms the heart; and to hear the union representatives get up and speak about their participation in this process and their pride in the company's achievement says it all as far as changing the culture of workplaces is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a magnificent achievement by this company, but it has been achieved within the framework that has been set by a Labor government; it has been achieved with the cooperation of management and their union representatives. M.C. Herd has achieved something that no other abattoir in Victoria or, indeed, Australia has been able to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That demonstrates the point that I am making. Labor in power has managed to extract conflict from industrial relations and has replaced it with cooperation. Such developments impact on the general economy. It has made a significant contribution to improving efficiency and improving national productivity. Australia's competitiveness has improved by some 40 per cent and our economy has made very substantial productivity increases. Those increases have been due in no small part to the cooperation that we have been able to engender in the workplace between the owners of capital and those who sell their labour to the enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the House has been proposed after extensive consultation with employers, state governments and unions. Its primary purpose is to streamline the process of resolving conflicts between employers and employees over unfair dismissals. It does this by providing for greater conciliation. It establishes processes for greater consent arbitration. For example, all applications must now be lodged with the Industrial Relations Commission, which will attempt to settle the matter by conciliation. We are simplifying the process&mdash;getting it away from the courts and into a room where parties can sit around a table and conciliate their differences. I am sure that development would be welcomed by members on both sides of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the legislation also provides for consent arbitration. That is an optional procedure, as either party can still elect to have the matter determined by the court if it so wishes. As far as state laws and the adequate alternative remedy test are concerned, this particular legislation provides that state laws can be tested against international standards and the federal act to ensure that they comply with the provisions of those conventions and the federal act. Overall, the amendments will ensure that workers will continue to be protected by laws which meet international standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For employees, this legislation maintains their fundamental protection. For employers, this legislation makes processing claims of unfair dismissal simpler and less legalistic. Thus it is not surprising that these amendments have been warmly welcomed, not only by the union movement but also by employer groups throughout the length and breadth of this country. For example, on 21 June, the ACTU issued a media release which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU today said proposed changes to the unfair dismissal provisions in the Industrial Relations Reform Act will inject greater fairness into the system, simplify the process and strengthen the role of the Industrial Relations Commission as the arbiter of employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a warm endorsement by the workers of this nation of these particular amendments. However, it does not end there. The MTIA issued a press statement on 21 June 1995 which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MTIA's Chief Executive, Bert Evans, today welcomed the announcement by the Government that it will amend the unfair dismissal laws to make them simpler, more effective and less legalistic.</PARA>
<PARA>That was echoed by other employer groups, including the Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which have supported the amendments to this legislation which is before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In no other area of public policy and government legislation are the differences between the government and the opposition so stark. In the Geelong region, which I represent in this parliament, the Barwon River divides the opinion of Geelong workers on industrial relations. On one side of the river is the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) who, in a recent letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, continued to perpetrate the coalition's deceptions on industrial relations to Geelong workers. On the other side of the river, in the electorate of Corio, the workers of Geelong are represented by somebody who will defend their interests, protect their awards and conditions and ensure that they are given adequate access to unfair dismissal procedures. That person&mdash;and I can say this with a degree of modesty&mdash;is, of course, me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geelong workers all know where the member for Corangamite is coming from. He has been a Howard supporter for a long time. We know that can be a kiss of death in the political sense because, as the WA Liberals know, if you support John Howard you end up on the back bench. Be that as it may, we also know that the honourable member for Corangamite is an enthusiastic supporter of Jobsback. He has never once on the public record repudiated the `take the contract or the sack' model of industrial relations that has been introduced into Victoria by the Kennett government. In the Geelong region, he has always been one of the coalition's great union bashers and, in his recent letter to the editor, he ridiculed the Accord that has been struck between the government and the workers and their representatives in the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me dwell for a minute on the Accord. It is an example of the government's use of incomes policy and it has delivered great benefits to the national and regional economy. It has laid the basis for sustained growth and job creation and it has reduced industrial disputation to historic low levels. The benefits to Geelong workers have been significant and far reaching. This Accord has underpinned economic policy and reduced inflation which, in the Liberal years, ate into their wages. It has preserved their basic award entitlements in an era of workplace bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Geelong workers, the Accord has created a safer working environment and has given them access to superannuation for the first time. Remember that, if we go back to the early 1980s, only about 40 per cent of Geelong workers had that superannuation, but now that figure is up around 80 per cent. It has given workers a better deal through lower taxes, Medicare, increased family assistance and increased spending on child care, education and housing. And, of course, it has brought industrial peace to the Geelong landscape. We know in Accord Mark VIII that the interests of Geelong workers will be further advanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the Accord is the preservation of the award system. Nowhere is the contrast between people on this side of the House and the opposition more stark. The government supports safety net increases, as outlined in the historic Accord Mark VIII which was recently struck. The opposition only gives vague promises in relation to safety net increases. As far as the award system is concerned, the government provides a comprehensive award safety net, including important conditions. The coalition stripped those award conditions back to four basic conditions. As for unfair dismissal, the government protects workers against unfair dismissal but, of course, the coalition wants to abolish it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, that recently Ford invested $1 billion in its Australian operation over a period of five years, and it gained a lot of headlines. What honourable members might not appreciate is that the company recently struck a very good enterprise deal with its work force. That particular enterprise agreement&mdash;an enterprise agreement, not an individual contract for each individual employee agreement&mdash;delivered a wage rise of 12 per cent over two years for the workers and delivered improvements in conditions, sickness benefits, and bereavement and family leave. It also improved leave assistance for emergency service volunteers, gave better training support, better superannuation and $25,000 a year for child-care support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Howard-Kennett industrial relations system, most of these conditions would be stripped away. The award conditions of Ford workers&mdash;some 2,500 of them in Geelong&mdash;would be stripped away by John Howard, Stewart McArthur and the Liberal candidate for the seat of Corio. That system has never been repudiated by the honourable member for Corangamite and I can only assume that he agrees with that system. He agrees with stripping away the wages and the conditions of Ford workers and workers in the textile industry. The honourable member for Corangamite continues to try to perpetrate on Geelong workers the great deception that he is interested in their welfare and that he will stick up for their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the reaction of Geelong workers to the Kennett industrial relations system? If it was so good, why have they fled in droves from it? That is the acid test. The acid test is whether the workers are satisfied with staying under that system or whether they have moved out of it. Teachers, electricians, hotel and hospitality workers, shop assistants, metal industry workers, clerical workers, public servants, professional engineers, nurses, firemen&mdash;the list goes on and on&mdash;are the people that have gone out of the state system, the Kennett-Howard industrial relations system, and sought the protection of the federal award system. I ask this question of honourable members opposite: if the state system is so good, why are the workers leaving it in droves? That is the acid test that we must apply to this industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the Kennett Employee Relations Act of 1992 will set only minimal conditions and it will remove from protection the workers' penalty rates, overtime payments, meal breaks, accumulated sick leave, bereavement leave, travel allowance, redundancy payments, shift premiums and paid maternity leave.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent review undertaken by AusAID of the effectiveness of its NGDO programs shows that non-government agencies do their often difficult work very effectively. The review found strong evidence that 90 per cent of NGDO projects supported by government funds are satisfactory or better in the achievement of project objectives. This confirms the confidence the government has had in NGDOs, a confidence reflected in the increase in the NGDO share of the official aid budget, which has gone from around two per cent to six per cent over the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will be aware that the Industry Commission has just conducted an extensive inquiry into charitable organisations in Australia, including NGDOs. In September 1994, I wrote to the Industry Commission requesting that its inquiry examine the issue of NGDO accountability for public donations. I did this not because I believed there was a crisis of confidence or trust in NGDOs, but in order to reinforce the trust which already exists. I was pleased to see the comprehensive coverage of the accountability issue in the commission's subsequent draft report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February this year I again wrote to the commission expressing a concern that the process of implementing its recommendations could be a long one, and seeking its views on the desirability of expediting interim accountability standards for NGDOs as a discrete group. I suggested to the commission that I might establish an advisory committee whose main task would be to advance the work on NGDO accountability prior to the introduction of the long-term, more formal and legal arrangements likely to result from the commission's work. I assured the chairman that my action in establishing that committee would in no way pre-empt his deliberations. He agreed that my suggestion could be a useful way forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 May this year, I confirmed in the House that I had established an NGDO Code of Practice Advisory Committee&mdash;COPAC, as it became known&mdash;to advise on possible interim measures. I asked that committee to report back by the end of August. I am pleased to announce that this morning the committee presented me with its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I  would  like  to  express  my  sincere thanks to the members of COPAC, and in particular to its chairman Mr Jim Ingram, for their work over the last three months. I thank first my two colleagues, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), for their valuable contributions to the committee's work. I thank too the Australian Consumers Association and the Australian Accounting Research Foundation for making available such high quality staff officers to contribute their expertise. Special thanks go to members of the NGDO community, and the sector's peak body, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), for their support and cooperation with COPAC in achieving its objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome COPAC's recommendations, and among them most notably that a code of conduct committee be established by October 1995. This committee would be established and financed by ACFOA, and would include representatives of ACFOA member NGDOs, other NGDOs, donors and the accountancy profession. It would be chaired by an eminent person from outside the NGDO sector, appointed in consultation with me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NGDO sector already has a relatively strong self-regulatory regime, centred on a code of ethics which has been mandatory for ACFOA members since 1989. The new arrangements will build on this foundation by establishing an entity representative of the whole sector, and to include sufficient representation from outside the sector to assure objectivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first task of the code of conduct committee will be to develop a comprehensive code of conduct, taking account of an illustrative code developed by COPAC, which includes detailed draft financial reporting standards, the ACFOA code of ethics and similar codes in place overseas. This committee will then monitor compliance with the code and receive and examine complaints relating to the sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be the first time that a comprehensive code of conduct, covering ethical principles, practical arrangements and detailed financial reporting standards, has been developed for the sector. That is an unambiguously good outcome, one which I know will be welcomed by NGDOs and their many supporters alike. The committee will develop the code of conduct in time for its implementation prior to the next financial year. The government will consider whether or not adherence to the code will be a condition of NGDOs receiving or retaining the tax deductibility concession for donations made in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, may I stress again that NGDOs are an important expression of the commitment of the Australian public to assist the poor and the needy in the developing world. NGDOs give tangible expression to this commitment by supporting projects which make a real difference to the lives of so many of those who live in poverty. It is crucial that this work continue and that the public commitment which underlies it is strengthened. I believe that the recommendations contained in the COPAC report will contribute to this end.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee operated in a short time frame and it took a number of submissions from the public and the aid sector. It held a number of face-to-face meetings with those involved. It also employed an accounting firm to look at, in a detailed way, the way that accounts can be presented. As the minister has said, the committee has reported on time, although the committee would have liked to have had a little more time if it had been possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the public understand a bit more about the NGDO sector. I learned a lot, and I thought I knew a bit about it before we started. The differing standards of accounting and reporting, the different sizes of the organisations and the different activities that are undertaken are complex and varied. Therefore, coming up with any recommendations that are relevant becomes quite an interesting challenge to any committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NGDO sector is also taking an increasing amount of government funding in the aid area. It is a growing requirement that the sector functions effectively, which I think by and large it does, and we are obviously keen to make sure that continues. One would be less than honest if one did not say that, although it was not the prime cause of the committee being set up, we were all conscious of the recent publicity associated with CARE Australia and the prominence that the sector was receiving as a result of that publicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACFOA, which is the industry body, has 75 per cent membership of those NGDOs involved but in income terms and expenditure terms it has about 90 per cent of the sector. It has its own ethics committee, but we have heard evidence that very few complaints have been lodged with it over the years, although my view was that that was probably because not many people knew that ACFOA existed or that it had an ethics committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been working on a code of conduct for about seven years and it has been working on standardising NGDO accounting standards for some time. However, there was a general acknowledgment in the industry, as well as outside, that the code could be improved, particularly in the area of governance. To that end, COPAC produced a sample code which I am sure will be helpful in the development of the full code when it eventually arrives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the executive director of ACFOA as a member of the committee, as well as the chief executive of World Vision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no question that the industry was very keen to maintain self-regulation but I believe there is a need to be seen to have outside accountability, and that was a view shared by the committee. Put simply, you cannot be both the advocate and the regulator. There is a need to maintain public confidence and to have that degree of independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from Minister Bilney about the Industry Commission activity and, of course, the results of that are going to be excellent, I am sure, but they are going to be a long way down the track. So there was a need for action now. In that sense, of course, the government already has at its disposal mechanisms in respect of direct taxation grants and aid. It has, but perhaps does not always use, its powers in respect of tax deductibility status for charitable organisations, NGDOs and so on. There was a need for maintaining ongoing public confidence, and it seems to me that transparency and independence are key criteria for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the COPAC recommendations are a reasonable compromise between the desire for self-regulation and objective transparency. We have suggested a code of conduct committee. The industry has the numbers, if you like, on that committee: out of the seven people who will be appointed, three come from ACFOA and one comes from the non-ACFOA members of the industry, so they have the majority on that new body. ACFOA has the secretariat and the administration. Of the three independents, one comes from the accounting sector and one from the consumer sector, and there is an independent chair. Of course, ACFOA will appoint the chairman, but with the agreement of the minister, and it is important that we recognise that the minister ultimately has much responsibility in this area of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time scales that have been recommended are very important, as well. This is the sort of area where trying to get agreement on a code of conduct or a code of practice from hundreds of organisations could, frankly, drag on for ever. So it is important to set some stakes in the ground, if you like, to aim at. The suggestion is excellent that the code of conduct body should be set up by 1 October this year, a month away, and the fact that ACFOA has agreed to that is to be commended. Having the start of the next financial year, the middle of 1996, as the deadline for that code of practice&mdash;including the accounting standards&mdash;to be in place, is also an important milestone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that, if we have the code of practice and the reporting standards in place, a number of the larger organisations will actually put them into practice for the following 12 months to test drive them, if you like, and that some valuable experience will be gained in terms of what the Industry Commission may then subsequently come up with. Then, perhaps 12 months later, those standards might be something which everybody should adopt. There is need for publicity for the code and for the new body itself. The government, as time goes by, must review the effectiveness of what has been put in place. In my view, we need ultimately to look at acceptance of the code of practice by the industry as a key criterion for tax deductibility status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of our time constraints, so I will conclude by saying that this is an important area of endeavour in our community. It is an endeavour that is supported by many people in the Australian public. Overseas, Australian aid is respected and well thought of and, therefore, this report and the implementation of its recommendations are an important step for many people in our community, as well as for the sector itself. I have confidence in the future of the sector, as I am sure all Australians do, and I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

Along with the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), I was lucky enough to be a member of the Code of Practice Advisory Committee. As a backbencher, one does not get too many opportunities in this House to participate in something as important as this report. As a long-time supporter of, and worker for, many non-government development organisations, I welcomed the opportunity presented to me to take part in this committee's hearings and, for that, I thank Minister Bilney.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has stated, the NGDO sector has a relatively strong self-regulatory mechanism based on its current code of ethics. These new arrangements will build on this already strong foundation and strengthen it even further by the establishment of the new code of conduct committee. This committee will include representatives of ACFOA members, of NGDOs which are not members of ACFOA, of donors and also of the accounting professing. A chairperson from outside the sector would be appointed, in consultation with the minister, to ensure that all complaints are dealt with fairly, and this chairperson would have ready access to the minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;HACC has been a most successful program and is central to the success of the government's aged care reform strategy. Since its inception in 1985, it has grown some 440 per cent, resulting in a large increase in the number and range of services available to the Australian community. However, there is room for improvement, and the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs has played an important role in identifying issues to be resolved and providing recommendations for the future of the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time, I wish to thank the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the members of the standing committee for the wide ranging inquiry they conducted into the HACC program. They have heard the concerns of the Australian community with regard to the program and proposed options for change. The standing committee's inquiry, along with the joint Commonwealth-state efficiency and effectiveness review of the HACC program conducted over a similar time frame as the inquiry, have proven to be complementary processes which address the needs of consumers, service administration and government responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of the two processes have come together in a way which enables the Commonwealth, in conjunction with state and territory governments, to establish a blueprint for improvements in community care. This partnership was exemplified by the agreement at the joint meeting of health and community services ministers to develop an implementation plan for the reform of the HACC program from 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also note that the Council of Australian Governments&mdash;COAG&mdash;is looking at reforms across the health and community services sector more broadly. Improvements in individual programs such as HACC can only help the wider process. The work that has been done to date on HACC will mean that the work of the broader reform can start from a higher base than would otherwise be possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns raised by the two reviews included:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to these issues, the reviews have proposed a range of options for the future structure and operation of the program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn first to consumers. The importance of focusing on consumers cannot be questioned. This emphasis on consumers and their needs is behind the move away from the funding of service inputs towards a focus on outputs and outcomes for consumers. Such an approach will allow service providers, who are in touch with the needs of their local community, to devise and deliver services to meet an individual's needs, rather than to deliver services to some preset formula. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry acknowledged the need to improve the assessment process currently undertaken in HACC and work has commenced on developing suitable options for independent assessment of consumers. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Regionalisation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry also places great emphasis on the development of an effective regional structure which is responsive to the needs of consumers and ensures that, no matter what region you live in throughout Australia, you will have equitable access to HACC services. Officers have been asked to develop mechanisms to improve regional planning and accountability processes. The program will move away from joint Commonwealth-state approval of individual projects to joint approval of the HACC program funds available to each region. It is proposed that program performance will be monitored by region and that these reports will be made public. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Clarification of the interface between health and community care</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of continuity between health and community services has also received a great deal of attention, with a number of proposals to be considered. One option is that the funding and provision of basic maintenance and support service for people with a moderate or severe functional disability in need of post-acute care be the responsibility of the HACC program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health sector would then be responsible for the provision of other post-acute care including any specialised services and all post-acute support for people not in the HACC target group. To develop this issue further, the Commonwealth and state and territory ministers have asked Health and HACC officers to make a joint submission on the funding and provision of post-acute services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow minister is unable to be here at this time today and therefore I am pleased, as deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, to respond on behalf of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the government's response to the recommendations of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS>, but we do believe that notwithstanding this response the parallel Commonwealth-state review of HACC should have been delivered somewhat sooner. After all, the report itself was tabled over a year ago, and the take note debate took place exactly one year ago today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nutshell, the key concerns of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs were that HACC is a very worthwhile program, but is severely impeded by its lack of clear objectives and clarity of overall purpose; uncertainty about its priority client groups or subgroups; uncertainty about allocations of interest and responsibility between Commonwealth, state and local governments, and between governments as program managers and service providers. There is also a lack of effective strategic planning and outcomes standards, and a lack of information and advice regarding services which are available to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) also responded to the findings of the Commonwealth-state efficiency and effectiveness review of HACC, which finally reported in June 1995. It would be good if this report could be widely disseminated to assist public debate on some of the vital issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accompanying the minister's statement is the official government response to the standing committee's 81 recommendations. I welcome the fact that the government appears to have treated the committee's report seriously, and that it has agreed to implement many of the recommendations and look at others. But we would also be greatly concerned if undertakings are not acted upon, as so often happens under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also add that I am, as always, a little sceptical when government responses to reports such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS> frequently emphasise that what is recommended is being acted upon. We found in the inquiry, when we heard from the bureaucratic experts, that often what was said was happening was not, in fact, happening in the field. If this were the case, there would have been no need to make recommendations in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has, only an hour or so ago, received a copy of the government's response to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS>, and we will be studying it closely. I should add that the shadow minister for health and human resources, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), will be discussing the recommendations with his state colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be studying the report of the Commonwealth-state review&mdash;a copy of which the government did not do us the courtesy of passing to the shadow minister, even though it is partly the subject of the minister's statement. We would like to see what message it holds for Commonwealth and state governments and for shaping coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HACC is really only a funding mechanism, and there is a lack of understanding in the community about what services are available. People may know about Meals on Wheels, domiciliary care and district or home nursing, but they do not see them as part of the HACC program, and they do not see them as integrated services, which is what the committee found. Our recommendations are strongly that these services must be integrated because they are being provided to the same client group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carers in particular need to know about the services that are available, because carers are also consumers. One of the single greatest reasons for the frail or disabled being admitted to institutions is carer fatigue. This crisis needs to be avoided; hence the committee's recommendations about focus and targeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes, as I have said, that the home and community care program has proved to be a very useful mechanism for managing the funding and provision of invaluable services to the frail and vulnerable members of the Australian community. This is what the member for Chisholm said in his speech in the take note debate on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS> report on 31 August 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the goal of allowing as many as possible elderly and functionally disabled people to remain in their homes and in their communities, is not questioned by me or the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA>We are concerned, though, to ensure that the maximum quantity of resources, in the form of a diversity of high quality services, is delivered effectively to the people needing them&mdash;the frail aged, people with disabilities, people requiring post-acute and palliative care and, of course, their carers.

As it does appear that the government will not be pursuing this bill, it obviously needed to find another basis on which these provisions, which were part of that bill, could be enacted. So they are being tacked on here, as I understand it. That is very convenient, but it belies the fact that the government has been endeavouring to legislate in areas relating to tribunal decisions, and that legislation was brought forward. It was very poorly drafted in other respects, and did meet with some opposition from ourselves, other parts of the community and representative bodies&mdash;and it was a difficult area in which to legislate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems to be bolstered, as I understand it, by results of further appeals that it has pursued and, therefore, no longer needs to press the balance of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4). Thus, we are faced with this situation where we are now tacking on to Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 the particular provisions that were worthy of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our support was there previously for this measure; that support has not changed. We are of the belief that applicants who have been unsuccessful in their application for a protection visa should abide by the umpire's decision and depart. We do not support unlimited access to our onshore protection visa processing facilities. Such unfettered access would be a misuse of a very important and expensive refugee determination program. We do not support the ensuing time wasting and stalling action that unfettered access to provisions and applications might result in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All applicants should be processed in accordance with the act and regulations, and their applications should be put at the first available opportunity. We are of the view that abuse of our regulations in the form of repeat applications is something that should be dealt with firmly, and we would not want to be a party to delaying provisions that might ensure that that be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee public hearings on the original bill, several groups did express concern that this would only lead to limiting access to Australia's processing system to applicants with genuine concerns. In such cases, the minister has the ability to grant consent to repeat applications, if he believes it to be in the public interest. We are of the view that this is an adequate safety net to ensure that the applications of those applicants whose situations clearly have changed or where there is fresh evidence can be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be reassuring if the Parliamentary Secretary, in addition to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) in another place, were to state what she believes is the relevant criteria with the initiation of these powers. Such clarification would be welcomed by both the coalition and those who have consistently voiced concern about the practical use or lack thereof of such discretionary powers. I do not know whether the parliamentary secretary is in a position to offer some advice on that matter. Obviously, if she were, it would be of some assistance to those who are anxious to know what perhaps is the public interest that might be considered and what relevant factors might be pertinent to the exercise by the minister of the non-compellable discretion that he has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been a little while waiting for my turn to make my contribution on the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. We will all recall that the original bill was introduced into the parliament on 28 October 1993 by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). You will recall that was at the end of the election year&mdash;the election took place in March 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition labelled that bill then the industrial relations payback bill, which in fact it was. It was a payback for the support the ACTU provided the Labor Party to win office in March 1993, and it still goes on. I think this is about the third amending bill the government has put forward in this place to try to fix up some of the inadequacies that were certainly in the first payback bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The express purpose of the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is to provide for applications for relief under the unfair dismissal provisions to be heard first by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission rather than by the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, as is presently the case. The second purpose is to allow the AIRC to undertake consent arbitration in relation to termination of employment matters with the agreement of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third purpose is to make it plain that the industrial court must decline to deal with an unfair dismissal claim where the former employee has access to an alternative remedy under the Commonwealth, state or territory law which satisfies the requirements of the International Labour Organisation's convention No. 158. It bears noting at this point that that is where this whole bill has got its genesis from&mdash;the International Labour Organisation convention No. 158 on the termination of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that earlier this year the minister was in Geneva making statements to the International Labour Organisation. At the ILO convention he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia some commentators have argued that the employment protections provided in our national industrial relations legislation would discourage employers from taking on new staff and result in higher unemployment. We believe we have achieved the right balance between employment creation and ensuring workers have a fair safety net to protect wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding these comments, on 21 June of this year the government announced several changes to the employment protections, thereby acknowledging the serious deficiencies in the unfair dismissal provisions. Here we are at the end of August and he has introduced this amending legislation to address inadequacies and deficiencies that have certainly been highlighted on numerous occasions by different commentators right around Australia. These inadequacies and deficiencies have arisen out of the introduction of this industrial relations payback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw that take place at the end of 1993. It has been acknowledged in this debate by the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) that the government in this place is the political wing of the trade union movement of Australia. The member for Capricornia said that in this debate today. She is admitting that connection. The government of the day had to make a payback for the support it received from the ACTU during the March 1993 election; that was, the bill introduced in October 1993. That legislation has been amended three times since. The further payback is that the government of the day, the Prime Minister of the day, has imposed the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, on the people of Batman. That is the linkage that continues to be made in Australia today. I think the people of Australia should rightly be very cynical about the way this government conducts itself in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the bill introduced the spokesman for industrial relations matters on our side, the member for Flinders, (Mr Reith) has moved the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not opposing the provisions of the bill and whilst recognising that this bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, the House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose a heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and that they were enacted without proper prior consultation".</PARA>
<PARA>I add: without proper prior consultation with that very important sector of the economy, being the small business community. That has been borne out now. We have had a lot of criticism in this debate from government members that members of the opposition in their contributions have been relying too heavily on a lot of the 10,000 cases that have gone before the courts since this legislation was enacted in late 1993. Why would members of the opposition not highlight some of those cases when the results of those cases are absolutely outrageous? The results of those cases are being enunciated in the press on a daily basis in Australia and frightening the living daylights out of small business people around Australia regarding creating any more employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the member for Capricornia here earlier in the debate crowing about how much extra employment has been generated by this government since its return to office in 1993, but she failed to point out that a large percentage of the jobs that have been created in that time are part-time and casual jobs. Why are we seeing that conundrum in Australia? It is because after the first amending piece of legislation, which took place probably 12 months ago, to exclude from the provisions of the original bill people who are gaining employment under some of the labour market programs which the government has in place, those people are excluded from the unfair dismissal provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only relief that employers, and particularly small business employers, will have is to put staff on not on a permanent basis but on a part-time basis. We have seen a proliferation of part-time employment, but that proliferation of part-time employment is still taken into account in the statistics in Australia today in the 600,000-odd jobs that the government and government members crow about having created in Australia since coming to power in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendment that has been moved by the member for Flinders as being very important in highlighting to the people of Australia what the original bill, as amended on a number of occasions, means. Even this amended bill, as it will no doubt pass through the House today, will have an effect on the business community and ultimately on the employment prospects of a lot of unemployed people in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year that fact was reinforced by a public view that was expressed by Bob Carr, who was the then Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales and is now the Labor Premier of New South Wales. This is not a Liberal Party apparatchik criticising this Labor government's legislation; this is the Labor Premier of New South Wales. Bob Carr, then the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales and now Premier of New South Wales, made this point on 13 April 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in the Federal law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are kids with good training, good education, who are not being given employment because employers won't take them on if they know that, down the track, whatever the circumstances, it is very difficult to effect a dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The European experience makes it very clear: if you make it complex for employers to vary their employment levels down the track, they won't take on employment to start with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth . . . I want to revise the Federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales,  criticising this federal Labor government's industrial relations law with regard to unfair dismissal. That view&mdash;that employers, because of this legislation, are reluctant to take on new employees on a full-time basis&mdash;has been reinforced by a survey that was undertaken by Recruitment Solutions. It was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in May where it was reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employer fears over the Federal Government's unlawful dismissal rules have been reinforced by a new survey which shows companies are already altering their recruitment strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Recruitment Solutions' survey of more than 600 employers of accounting staff found that 12 per cent of companies put on fewer permanent staff last year due to the legislation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>due directly to this legislation. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many companies are worried about unfair dismissal actions being taken against them by sacked&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or retrenched&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">employees, and are increasingly using temporary and contract staff.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a survey of 600 companies carried out by Recruitment Solutions. Incredibly, as at 9 June 1995, under the unlawful termination provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, over 10,000 matters had been filed with the court, of which approximately 7,300 had been finalised. Only seven per cent of applications, however, were dealt with by the court. These figures contrast with the total of 452 other matters&mdash;matters not related to unfair dismissals&mdash;that had been lodged with the Industrial Relations Court by 29 May 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does that not highlight what is going on as a result of the industrial relations legislation that has been introduced by this government&mdash;10,000 matters directly related to unfair dismissal whilst at the same time only 452 other matters were lodged with the court. That is an absolutely unbelievable set of circumstances. Little wonder that we continuously, day in and day out, read about some of the outrageous findings of the court in relation to unfair dismissal cases and how the employers of people who have been dismissed are being forced to reinstate them and pay them lump sum compensation payments. Little wonder there is so much for the media across Australia to report. There were 10,000 cases as at 9 June 1995. The legislation came before this parliament only in October 1993. That is hardly 18 months ago. There were only 452 other matters registered with the court in the same period. That is absolutely unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are some of the criticisms that are being levelled at this legislation from different sections of the community? The criticism is not just coming from the opposition benches, and bear in mind that we support the government's proposed amendments to this legislation. We are saying that the legislation is not going far enough to provide fair and equitable unfair dismissal provisions for everybody concerned in the employment situation&mdash;employer and employee alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been three strands of criticism of the 1993-94 unfair dismissal provisions. Firstly, it is argued that the institutional machinery for dealing with such claims is unduly bureaucratic. It is said that there was little reason to create the Industrial Court and that, even if such a body could be justified, the act should have provided that proceedings be initiated in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by way of some form of conciliation&mdash;not in the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is claimed that the post-1993 act is loaded against the employer and would lead to both unfair results and a loss of employment. I refer to the judgment of Justice Gray of the Industrial Court in the case of Fryar v. Systems Services Proprietary Ltd of May 1995 cited in the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's June newsletter. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former State [South Australian] Act and the present State Act, like their counterpart in New South Wales, operate in the realm of the `fair go all round'. This is not a realm that this Court inhabits. The provisions of Division 3 . . . of the federal Act are not directed at achieving some balance between the interests of employers and employees in particular cases. They constitute a charter of rights for employees. They are directed towards the protection of the existing jobs of employees.</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, a number of specific provisions of the Industrial Court have been attacked, in essence, for placing too much weight on procedural issues and not enough weight on the merits of the case. A common complaint has been that some ex-employees have been rewarded relief, although there was a good reason for their being dismissed&mdash;merely because the employer did not adopt proper procedures in bringing the contract to an end. They are just some of the criticisms that have been levelled at this legislation which was enacted in 1993 and which has been amended on a number of occasions since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the coalition is asking for is a fair go all round. It is interesting to read some of the headlines in the newspapers. Stories are constantly being written in the media about this piece of legislation. As it was and as it is going to be amended, it is still unfair. One headline reads, `Unfair dismissal laws must provide a fair go all round.' Isn't that what Australia is all about? Isn't Australia all about a fair go for all concerned? Can the government tell the people of Australia that having 10,000 cases before the courts regarding unfair dismissals in 18 months&mdash;in a large percentage of those cases, employers are being bound by the decisions of the court to make lump sum payments to people that have been dismissed as well as to reinstate those people&mdash;is providing a fair go all round?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another headline reads, `Woman tells boss to shove job.' So what happens? The court tells the boss to put the woman back on and pay her $5,120 in compensation. It is unbelievable. I will guarantee that, if any government members were put in that circumstance, they would absolutely scream blue murder. Another headline reads, `Sacked public servant wins appeal.' Another headline reads, `IRC finds dismissal of pot smoker unjust.' In that particular case, the person was operating within the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, which trades as Pacific Power. That was under the New South Wales legislation. But they still find relief under the provisions of the Commonwealth act. That person was endangering his follow workers. Another headline reads, `Sex case lecturer reinstated.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will close by referring to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> headed `Why unfair dismissal laws are still unfair to the bosses'. I have read out the first part of it, which reports the speech by the Minister for Industrial Relations to the ILO in Geneva this year. He said the legislation was not having a detrimental effect on employment in Australia. There are an interesting couple of paragraphs in this article by Professor Judith Sloan. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government claims that the strong growth in employment since 1994 refutes the proposition that employers have been deterred from filling jobs because of the new provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But on recent labour force figures, the increase in part-time employment has been more than double the increase in full-time employment. Moreover, about three-quarters of all part-time jobs are casual. The suspicion is that the laws have skewed the nature of new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>And that is an absolute fact. The research that I have done shows that some manufacturing industries in my electorate are getting a bit of a kick along at the moment. I will be the first to acknowledge that. Lansdowne Engineering, part of the Goninan's company, has picked up some large contracts from the National Rail Corporation. Some other smaller manufacturers in Port Macquarie are picking up contracts. But the anecdotal evidence that is coming to me is that they are not putting on any more permanent employees. Small business is not putting on any more permanent employees. Why? They cite one, and only one, reason: the unfair dismissal provisions of the Labor government's industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that are being debated in this bill today are not going to make any difference to them. All they are doing is putting on part-time employees so that they can circumvent the provisions, via the amendment to the act that the government made some time last year because of the effect the legislation was going to have on part-time workers employed under labour market programs. Small business people today are only employing people on a part-time basis because they do not want to be exposed to some of the decisions that are being made in the courts&mdash;those 10,000 cases that have been before the courts. Not only do they have to fork out for their legal defence, but also they have to fork out lump sum payments to the employees that have been dismissed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opening remarks I want to say a few things about the history of legislation dealing with unfair dismissals. Until the 1970s it was the case that, by and large, there were no laws dealing with unfair dismissals in this country and an employer's so-called rights were virtually unfettered. Then, some laws at the state level were introduced which had the effect of requiring employers to ensure that the way they acted in relation to their employees was with some degree of humanity and decency. If they were to dismiss an employee, it had to be on the basis that that dismissal, at least in South Australia and New South Wales, was not harsh, unfair or unjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of those laws ameliorated what, prior to that, in the case of some employers, had been very harsh treatment of employees. Those laws in South Australia and New South Wales subsequently became the basis of the amendments which were made at the federal level and which became law across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of changes to those laws over a period of time, and this is a continuation of that. The basic situation, as is mostly the case with employment contracts, is that employees are in a position of weakness compared with employers. In the next few moments, I want to deal with an aspect of the weakness of employees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As part of the arrangements made, not only under legislation but also in relation to employees' contracts of employment, it is often the case that, because of enterprise bargaining and the like, employees are not simply paid in cash but are required to be paid through bank accounts. My concern is that this, in effect, has put a cost burden on employees which was not there before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my constituents have complained very bitterly to me that awards, agreements and enterprise bargaining have led to their having traded away their right to receive their pay in cash. When they have received their first payment by way of bank debit, it has come as a tremendous shock to them to find that not only are they required to pay state government charges by way of so-called BAD and FID taxes&mdash;bank account debit and financial institution duty taxes&mdash;but they are also required to pay quite substantial amounts in bank charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document that I have incorporated indicates quite clearly how substantial and dramatic in dollar amounts in a 12-month period those charges, which are foist upon employees through the arrangements which have been made on their behalf through enterprise bargaining and the like, can be. That is not to say that arrangements entered into for the payment of employees through bank accounts and the like should be excluded by legislation. Good grief! I am not suggesting that for a moment. But I do think it would be desirable for the industrial laws of our country to provide that, where costs such as FID tax, BAD tax and other bank charges will be lumped onto employees, people ought to be made clearly aware of that at the time when enterprise bargaining or award negotiations are under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frequently, that is not the case, and it can lead to a situation where an employee could actually be worse off by maybe $100 per year as a result of state government taxes and charges on bank accounts, and charges that banks levy themselves. I think that issue needs to be aired at greater length. Certainly, with our responsibilities to our constituents we ought to ensure that employees know more about those charges before they enter into agreements or before they become subjected to awards that provide for payment through bank debit arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by simply saying that this piece of legislation is a continuing part of the reform of the unfair dismissal laws. Whilst they have been criticised by some quarters, as has been pointed out by those opposite, overall they will lead to a position which, from everybody's point of view, is fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have raised concerns about whether this legislation will lead to the exclusion of the Commonwealth's jurisdiction in some states and whether that would be fair across the Commonwealth. Some people might be entitled to remedies in certain states that other citizens will not be entitled to because they live in other states. That is an issue which is yet to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the industrial commission and court will be acutely aware of those problems and I have no doubt that we will try to ensure that whatever decisions they make take account of the criticisms that have been made in that regard.

Employment, like politics or any other process within our community, is all about relationships. The relationship between employer and employee needs to be built on trust and faith in one another. But we have a situation here where, through legislation, we are forcing certain standards on that relationship. Standards do not come just through legislation; they come through relationships, through trust and faith in one another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago we introduced legislation relating to unfair dismissal. It has created major havoc in the community. Some 10,000 cases have been submitted for hearing. It is quite unbelievable that 10,000 cases of unfair dismissal could be heard in that short a time. It is an increasing trend that when people lose their jobs, for whatever reason, they make an unfair dismissal claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even Martin Ferguson&mdash;the ALP candidate for the seat of Batman in Melbourne and the current President of the ACTU&mdash;conceded that the outcomes of some unfair dismissal cases have been, to use his word, `indefensible'. That would indicate that there are some problems with the act and that is why we are amending it today. Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, was quoted recently as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are kids with good training, good education, who are not being given employment because employers won't take them on if they know that, down the track, whatever the circumstances, it is very difficult to effect a dismissal.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a very serious problem in Australia at the moment&mdash;that is, youth unemployment. We have employers, according to the Premier of New South Wales, not willing to put on young people these days because down the track they will find it difficult to manage their staff. Over the last couple of years we have had the Labor government proclaiming that 600,000 new jobs have been created over the last period. But we have to realise that most of that is casual and part-time work. It is not really suitable for those wanting to have an extended career in any sort of employment&mdash;in fact, for those not having any job security, through casual work. We must bring everything into the right context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern, like that of Bob Carr, is that we are not looking after our young people within Australia. Our greatest asset in Australia is not our mineral wealth, our agricultural industry or our manufacturing industry; our greatest asset in Australia is our young people. We should be looking after them. We should be looking after them before they go to school, with their child-care arrangements, looking after them through their schooling period, giving them opportunities and giving them work when they finish their schooling, because they are our future. If we do not look after our future by looking after our assets now, what will our country be like in 30 or 40 years?</PARA>

I agree with him: it is unfair to young people because it is not giving them opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the examples that we have had of unfair dismissal cases. We had the case of a lecturer who was charged with sexual harassment of his students. There was no disputing the facts; he was sexually harassing his students. He was dismissed, he lodged an appeal and his appeal was granted. He was reinstated and compensated. Here he was sexually harassing his students and, apparently, you cannot be dismissed for that, according to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had a worker in a funeral parlour who was dismissed for cremating the wrong body. It is quite amazing that someone could mistakenly cremate an unfortunate dead Australian&mdash;cremate the wrong body. The employer took the unusual action of dismissing this particular person. He took the matter to the commission and was awarded $800,000 compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had another case of a manager&mdash;they are not all employees&mdash;of a company. There was a downturn in the company and it was $300,000 in the red. The owners of the company said, `We really can't have you around because there has been a downturn in business and we've got to let you go.' He took that to the commission and he was reinstated, although the business was $300,000 in the red. I would have thought that was an indication of a downturn in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another case of stealing, where an employee was caught pilfering from his employer, which is a criminal offence in itself. He was dismissed, but later reinstated with compensation. There was also the case of a person who was swearing and abusing her employer, telling her in no uncertain terms what she thought about the employer and the company, and she resigned and left immediately. She was reinstated under unfair dismissal provisions and given $5,000 in compensation because the court found that it was not fair that she should not be able to abuse the employer. She got her job back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said it agrees with the unfair dismissal arrangements in the legislation we are discussing today. The ACCI wants those arrangements in place to keep unscrupulous employers honest. It welcomes the amendments, but it says they do not go far enough, particularly in the areas of onus of proof, the lack of a filing fee and a filtering mechanism, the inclusion in the act of the ILO recommendation, the costs associated with providing these court cases, the provisions concerning absence on sickness, the lack of power for the commission to determine applications other than on a voluntary basis and so on. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is also very concerned about the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the President of the ACTU concerned about the legislation, we have the Premier of New South Wales concerned about the legislation and we have the peak Australian employment body concerned about the legislation and saying these amendments are not going far enough. I tend to agree with that, because I do not think they are going far enough. I will speak a bit later on about what those amendments could be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are we discussing this? The reason is that industrial relations in Australia, in my view, is a bit out of control at the moment. We have an industrial relations system primarily based upon the industrial age, which is quite normal. We have a union system in Australia based upon the English model. The union system, with their political arm in Australia being the ALP, are running the government at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the ALP talk about the number of disputations being down since they have been in government. Of course they would be&mdash;because the ACTU and the ALP are one and the same. If you doubt that, you only have to look at Martin Ferguson's recent endorsement as a candidate, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), former President of the ACTU, and of course Jennie George, the incoming President of the ACTU and former ALP candidate in the Senate. They are one and the same. The number of disputations go down when the ALP is in government because it is a natural course of action to happen. We cannot be confused about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this is that we have a frontbench government which is run based on the English union model. This is particularly a problem because the industrial age is over and we are now in a period of transition between the industrial age and the information or technology age. I have listened to all the speakers from the government side, and I must admit that I have looked up their backgrounds. None of them have business experience and none of them have actually gone out to create a dollar. I doubt very few of them would have had dirt under their fingernails from any work they might have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on that side of the House are still industrial age thinkers. They do not understand that the new age, the information age, which is based upon technology, requires a different structure of industrial relations. New age thinking is where we empower workers, employees, to carry out decision making and get them to do things how they want them to be done and to take responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find the government still has an autocratic model. They still think in terms of an autocratic model based on pyramids, whereas the new models for the information age are based on separate working modules, requiring people to be empowered, requiring them to make their decisions and have their own choices. Yet we have an industrial relations system which is forcing employees to deal with unions, whom they do not particularly want to deal with. Now we have legislation in place which is forcing employers to have a confrontational attitude towards their employees. As Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, has stated, it is not encouraging employers to employ young people. They are our greatest asset, and we should be considering that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always hear about the Labor Party and what they believe in. They always use the words `decency' and `fairness' as if to say that people on this side of the House are not decent or fair. The Labor Party always talk about their values as being decency and fairness, but are they really? What they are working on is the award system. As we all know, the award system brings everybody down to the lowest common denominator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I mean by that is that, if you are a good employee and you work hard, you cannot get any extra money under the award. You can get only the same amount of money as the poorest worker&mdash;the one who does not respect the employer or the company he or she works for and who does not want to take the responsibility of putting in any effort. That person gets the award and the best worker gets the award. So the award system does not reward those who put in and take that responsibility; it awards those people who have the slow screwdrivers and so on by dragging everyone back down to their level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not even interested in responding to that. The point is that an individual who does put an effort in cannot get rewarded under the Labor Party scheme. The Labor Party has dehumanised the IR system. More than anything else, they have turned workers into economic figures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is more concerned about figures than about human relationships. This is what the Labor Party has forced us into.

They are still in this industrial age thinking process. They are not really into the information or technology age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party believes in supporting relationships. The Liberal Party likes supporting families in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were in control of the legislation, we would like to see seven points drawn up. We would like to meet our international obligations. That is in due course. We would like to have employees have access to appeal. I do not think anyone disagrees with that. If dismissals are unfair, people should have access to appeal. But the system should be fair and just for both sides, not just fair for one side. It should have a minimum legal cost associated with it. We should discourage frivolous claims. Too many frivolous claims are being made and clogging up the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community standards should be met. In other words, stealing is a criminal offence and we should be taking action. Therefore, if you are caught stealing, you should be dismissed. We should be meeting those community standards. The system should be user friendly. Currently the system is not user friendly, and we should be working towards making it user friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Labor Party really has dehumanised industrial relations. They are not looking at it in a personal, humanised sense. They talk about all their efforts and decency and fairness. They talk about the 600,000 jobs, when in fact most of them are jobs for casual employees. They talk about the unemployed, but they do not talk much about the youth unemployed in Australia. Youth are our greatest asset and we should be addressing youth unemployment. We are not really addressing it in a very serious way as a nation at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should take some responsibility in showing some leadership in these issues. They are talking about leadership in the industrial age, but they have not really addressed themselves to the information age and new technology. They are not talking about empowering employees; they are talking about demanding things. They are not talking about effective decision making; they are talking about forcing decisions upon employees. The sooner there is an election, the better it will be for our great country. I think you will find that the Australian people will choose the Liberal Party because we are the party that deals in relationships and we are the party that will respond with positive industrial relations policy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition was hoping that the government's attempts to use monetary and fiscal policy to bring it back would see a dive into the ground and we would be back to a low growth economy; and this news, as I said the other day in the House, of 3.7 per cent would have been greeted by the opposition like sucking on a lemon. What has happened is that it has come off from six and the growth has basically steadied and started to accelerate again to between 3 1/2 and four per cent. In other words, as I said yesterday, it is going at a good clip but, at the same time, the element of the accounts, the broadest measure of inflation, the non-farm GDP deflator, is 2.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Could you imagine, had the coalition been able to break the back of Australian inflation, the noise and the constant claims we would have heard about the inflation rate? Here it is again, quarter after quarter, at 2.1 per cent on the broadest measure of inflation. Again, there has been very strong business investment&mdash;7.9 per cent growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you go through the various elements of the accounts, there is moderate wages growth and productivity numbers in the market sector&mdash;1.6 per cent for productivity. In the non-farm market sector, it is 2.3 per cent. The equivalent number in New Zealand has been about one per cent. So, wherever you look through these accounts, I think you will find that we have succeeded in slowing the economy to a sustainable path. We have had, of course, enormous employment growth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for his question. There was a very significant conference this week held in the member for Bonython's electorate which addressed this issue. It was a conference that I addressed and it was a conference that my counterpart also addressed. Clearly, the government does acknowledge the serious problem associated with youth unemployment, and that was behind a major part of the thrust of Working Nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation is having a major impact in terms of getting the number of unemployed youth down. In the time that it has been operating, the number of unemployed youth has come down by 14 per cent. The number of long-term unemployed youth in the 15- to 19-year-old category has come down by 20 per cent and, in the 20- to 24-year-old category, by 30 per cent. I think this indicates the importance of targeted measures that go specifically to the particular problems affecting young people. We also recognised the importance of training and education. It is revealing to remind the House that the unemployment rate is twice as high for people who do not complete secondary school as it is for those who do complete post-secondary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, if you look at the traineeship program that this government has introduced, you will see that 80 per cent of teenage trainees are still in work 12 months after the traineeship has been completed. That is why Working Nation was about expanding the opportunities available through traineeships and through education. The commitment that I have made is that the programs we have on offer will be more flexible and that we will develop a real connection between training and getting the job. I look forward to suggestions coming from that conference as to how we can work with youth and their representatives on implementing such proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, the opposition was also at the conference. They were asked one thing by the young people in terms of their attendance at the conference: tell us what your policy is? But the shadow spokesman, the member for Goldstein, gave a 14-page speech avoiding just that question. He did not avoid the questions following the speech. In those questions he did get cornered. He got cornered on the question of youth wages and on work for the dole. What he has said effectively has been that they in office would be about cutting the training wage. He has admitted that it could be cut under their proposals and that, in the development of the rate, only employers would be consulted&mdash;not youth, the people who are going to get the wage rate, and not the unions that represent them.

On the question of voluntary and community work, he also raised the issue of using those groups in the community to provide useful activity. We do not disagree with that approach. In fact, we are doing it. But we are doing it through the new work opportunities program which has attached to it a training wage&mdash;an award based rate of pay. But their agenda is not to support the continuation of the new work opportunities program, which pays that award based rate; it is to require people to undertake those activities for the dole&mdash;not for the wage rate or the award rate, but for the dole.</PARA></TALK.START>

So there you have it: a commitment from us to a program that is demonstrating it is working. We are one year into a four-year program which is making important progress, and we have a commitment to follow that up in the next three years. But their strategy is to cut youth wages, force people to work for the dole and provide no funds for the important labour market programs that are working.

At the time it was supposedly announced, I must have missed it. I think I was in the same position as everyone else: we did not realise that such a comprehensive plan had actually been announced&mdash;and that is basically because it wasn't. Nevertheless, the claim has been made that it was. The claim was made by the Leader of the Opposition when he was talking to Pru Goward on ABC radio last week. He was asked about the balance of payments. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I have addressed that problem, I did it in great detail and it was widely responded to by economic commentators as a coherent plan to tackle the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>Where did he actually do that? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I laid down in my second headland speech, a clear plan to fix the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>Those of us who heard that speech or read that speech were all astonished to hear that claim because, frankly, no-one regarded it as a speech which had any detail of any kind, let alone a detailed, comprehensive plan to tackle the current account problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After he made that speech it was the general impression that he had not put in much detail. Perhaps the best evidence of that was at his first interview with Paul Barber on Radio 3AW. Paul Barber started off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Now, your headland speech today, economic policy. I mean, let's be honest, it's one of the great motherhood speeches of all time, isn't it? I mean, you didn't tell us anything?</PARA>
<PARA>This is the speech that was supposed to give the detailed plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me briefly take the House through what was involved in this detailed plan. Remember that the main item was the productivity commission. This was supposed to be the big new initiative. EPAC, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Industry Commission would be put together into one body called the productivity commission. What was it going to do? It was going to do the things which are already being done. It was going to have a stocktake of progress on micro-economic reform; the Industry Commission does that now. It was going to benchmark micro-economic reform activities; the BIE does that now, and the Industry Commission does it for government business enterprises and the delivery of government services. It was going to identify international best practice by industry and disseminate the results; that is what AusIndustry does. So all these things that it is going to do are already being done. So much for that major new initiative!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to savings, he said that he was going to make significant public savings, but there were no details at all as to the extent of those savings or where they would be made. This is what he now claims is a clear plan which addresses the problem in great detail&mdash;with absolutely no detail whatever about the savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On monetary policy, he said that he would not tell the Reserve Bank what to do. Well, we do not tell the Reserve Bank what to do. He said that he would encourage it to make detailed statements on monetary policy. That is what happens now. In fact, the Governor of the Reserve Bank made a detailed statement on economic and monetary policy yesterday in Los Angeles, and I recommend it to the opposition as something very much worth reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also endorsed the bank's and the government's inflation target. That was his monetary policy&mdash;his big new initiative on monetary policy&mdash;just doing what we are doing. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to APEC, he said he endorsed our policy for development of an open trading system within the region. So big change there! No change. He endorses our policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the commercialisation of Australian research, his big new initiative was to ask big business to give him some ideas about how he could commercialise research. So there is no detail there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said he called for coordination of infrastructure policy at the Commonwealth-state level. Well, there is already substantial coordination. Look at things like the National Rail Corporation, the standard gauge rail, the development of a national electricity market, and the agreed policy between us and the states about free and fair trade in gas. There is a lot of coordination occurring already in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, he trotted out again his labour market reform&mdash;the old policy of stripping away award protections from workers, plus some union bashing proposals&mdash;a policy which would lead to major industrial confrontation and spiralling wage claims. So no solutions to the balance of payments current account deficit there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we had from the Leader of the Opposition's supposed detailed plan was just a mishmash of industrial confrontation, half-baked ideas and endorsement of an array of government policies. So much for having a new, detailed plan. The only plan that is around to tackle the current account is the government's plan, and that is a comprehensive plan.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is last week. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, you see, because between the time I'd asked the first questions, a week prior to that, and on Tuesday 24 November, when I asked the second series of questions relating to the same subject, I had spoken to Penny Easton who reiterated that the information she had with respect to the $200,000 payment or thereabouts was, in fact, correct. So, that is why I put the questions again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he says brazenly&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And she was quite adamant about it. And I recall her being quite adamant, in her very gentle fashion, that the information she had received and passed on to me was right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You see, I saw here a subject that had nothing to do with the Family Court, but more a subject that had to do with WA Inc.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is the same line we are hearing over here. Here is one of the main questioners on the Liberal side saying directly this week that Penny Easton asked him to raise the matters, and insisted he raise the matters. But that is not in the terms of reference of the royal commission. It is only when Brian Mahon asked Halden to present a petition that it is a national crime. Then we have three or four members of the opposition saying that because of that petition, at the behest&mdash;they are implying&mdash;of the Minister for Human Services and Health, Penny Easton committed suicide. Yet here is Lightfoot on radio in Perth this week saying that Penny Easton encouraged him, asked him and insisted that he continue to ask a series of questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the other half of the marriage came in&mdash;remember that Burke had already upbraided him and said that there were marital problems&mdash;the Speaker said that these questions should not be asked as there could be a breach of the Family Law Act and the Family Court. There are no terms of reference referring to that, although Commissioner Marks said yesterday that Richard Court may be called to explain why he introduced this material. The reporter says to Lightfoot:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did it concern you at the time that you were becoming embroiled, if you like, well, in a dispute that was before the Family Court, clearly, but also that it was obviously a very personally traumatic situation for both parties?</PARA>
<PARA>Lightfoot said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, it didn't worry me a jot . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The gall of them. This was what he was saying on radio. The Minister for Human Services and Health has been upbraided all around the country when they are admitting raising at Penny Easton's request these matters in the parliament and, when a journalist asked Lightfoot, `Didn't it concern you a bit that you were in the middle of a traumatic thing,' he said, `No, it didn't worry me a jot.' What do the Liberal Party think they are doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to get on the record that on the Friday the petition was tabled, the next day, Geoff Parry of Channel 7 News, Perth, pursued Penny Easton from her house into her garage, and then she broke down into hysterics and had to be rescued from Parry by friends.

I recall that the Speaker said, `I refer members to certain questions without notice which were asked by the member for Murchison-Eyre on Tuesday of this week. It has been suggested that those questions were based on information concerning proceedings before the Family Court. The release of this information might well have been unlawful. The point that does concern me, however, is whether the privilege of freedom of speech in this House might be being used to circumvent an explicit order of a court or a written law of this country. Obviously, it makes a mockery of observing a sub judice convention if the House tolerates or encourages speeches or questions aimed at subverting an order or rule given in an appropriate court.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australian Liberal backbencher Wilson Tuckey said yesterday his personal attacks on Carmen Lawrence had been generally agreed by the coalition as being extremely legitimate. He said he intended to repeat the attacks he made in parliament in which he said Dr Lawrence had blood on her hands over the suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It has been generally agreed we had to expose Carmen's history during the campaign. The campaign team was delighted with the exposure they got from my speech," Mr Tuckey said.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the state of the Liberal Party; yet we had these matters being raised, obviously at the behest of Penny Easton, by the members of the coalition in Western Australia. Two years later, Easton has had them raised by a petition he has had Halden produce which the WA upper house said `breached no privilege,' and it is a conservative dominated upper house committee. Richard Court has drafted the terms of reference narrowly to cover only the presentation of the petition by the other side of the marriage and has exonerated himself. Liberal politicians are saying that Richard Court carefully drafted the terms of the petition so as to exclude himself from needing to give evidence. He would be very unhappy that Mr Marks yesterday said that maybe he might have to give evidence. That is why you are up here today with questions, doing your bidding for him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is, as I have said, a kangaroo court. There is a massive unfairness in all this. I think all members of the Australian public are coming to understand how massively unfair it is, what an abuse of executive power it is and how the coalition, in seeking to say, as it has explicitly, that Carmen Lawrence was responsible for Penny Easton's suicide, it stands condemned and will stand condemned further for the tactics which are now being employed by John Howard's coalition.</PARA>

When the Leader of the Opposition specifically put this to the Speaker&mdash;I am not surprised he put it to you because, quite frankly, too many times we have had rough treatment handed out to this side of our House&mdash;our expectation was that when we get the same behaviour from the other side the same treatment will be meted out to them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I must also say that we find that this is not a single event isolated from others. Sadly, I must say that this particular ruling of the Speaker reflects other rulings and other processes which the government has adopted in the last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had only yesterday an abuse of parliamentary process of a sort that, I must say, I have not previously seen in the parliament, and I have been here for 10 years. Yesterday a matter was raised by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). He raised a significant issue; it was a matter of privilege. The matter of privilege he raised went to the processes by which the Speaker ruled earlier in the day on another matter which had been before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England, in the matter of privilege which he put to the Speaker, suggested that he had concerns about the involvement of the Speaker and his office in the preparation of a motion which condemned the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). At that time, the Speaker came back into the House and, in an unprecedented way, made a statement to the House to the effect that, as the matter raised by the right honourable member for New England went to the Speaker's own functions and operations, in this particular case the matter would be best sent off to the Privileges Committee. That in itself was not an unfair statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only a matter of commonsense that where there are hot political issues in the House, as the Speaker in his statement suggested, then rather than having them adjudicated in the House they ought to go off to a committee&mdash;a fair point that any fair-minded person would agree with. Instead of having the matter go off to the Privileges Committee, as suggested by the Speaker, the government brutally used its numbers to overturn the clear advice and opinion of the Speaker and simply disregarded and overturned the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee. That is one instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a second instance yesterday which, I must say, also did not reflect well on the chair. That was the matter concerning the member for Chisholm. In that case, we had a spurious matter raised earlier in the week by the Prime Minister, who claimed that the member for Chisholm had arguably been in breach of privilege. So spurious was it&mdash;perhaps it was a premonition&mdash;that I raised the matter prior to the Speaker's response on the basis that the privilege claimed by the Prime Minister should be treated as equivalent to spurious points of order. It was so transparently a political tactic&mdash;a political tactic employed by the Prime Minister, in cahoots with other members of the government, so as to take the heat off the Carmen Lawrence affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each and every element of this fracas is part and parcel of the defence that the government has been running: to basically tough it out against the evidence, which has shown, virtually as conclusively as you can possibly get, that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had misled the Western Australian parliament and that, subsequently, in an address to the National Press Club&mdash;the controversial speech which was passed across the table&mdash;she had also misled the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that statement, in response to the matter of privilege raised by the Prime Minister, the Speaker came to the conclusion that it was one of those issues that could go either way. I must say that I was very disappointed in that statement by the Speaker because this was a clear case. There was no way known that it was open to doubt. This was an open and shut case. There was no question of privilege whatsoever. Everybody in this House knows it. Everybody in the gallery who knows anything about these matters knows that the whole thing was spurious and should never have been put up, but we know the basis of it, the motivation of it. It was merely a tactic. </PARA>

I have my suspicions about that, but we do know that the Prime Minister's office, on the afternoon before the Speaker made his statement, were busy making their own inquiries as to who was on the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason they were making inquiries as to who was on the Privileges Committee was that they wanted to see what argument there would be in the Privileges Committee if this spurious privileges claim ever got to the committee. The conclusion they reached is pretty obvious. It was that if the matter was sent to the Privileges Committee there would, at the very least, be a dissentient voice, a minority voice, and that that would tarnish and reveal the paucity of the claim being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, those two matters alone&mdash;though there are a number of others, in addition to the matter that has been raised today&mdash;unfortunately present a picture which, from the opposition's point of view, reveals the operation of the parliament not to be even-handed and fair but to be totally weighted against the interests of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that in the sense that any particular individual should be given any particular airplay, but I emphasise its importance by saying this. The parliament is the people's parliament. We are here as representatives of the people and it is our function to stand and speak on behalf of our constituents. Sure, the party political system has its play. There are many factors at work. That is the essence of the democratic system. When, as in this current parliament, you have rulings which clearly fly in the face of the right of private members to raise matters, you are not denying us personally, as individuals, the right to speak, the right to be heard, the right to present the case and points of view of our constituents; you are denying the rights of our constituents to be heard. That is why we take this as a matter of very grave concern, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we get a bad ruling, a poor ruling, a ruling without precedent, of the sort we had today, we lodge our objections not just on behalf of those sitting in this place but on behalf of our constituents, who are entitled to have a parliament in which every voice is allowed to be heard in the proper form and in accordance with the standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that requires, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the impartiality which only the Speaker can bring to affairs of the chamber. Yes, this chamber can be a theatre. Yes, this chamber can be overcome by controversy. Yes, it can be overcome by the emotions of the moment. Yes, it can be overcome by ill-judgment from time to time. When it is so overcome, it is the responsibility of the Speaker to fairly adjudicate on the matters put to the Speaker. I would have to say that on this occasion there is no way known that this is fair treatment. This is about as blatant and clear a case of unfair treatment being meted out to this side as you could have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, I suppose&mdash;and I would say this is a sad reflection on a parliament&mdash;in a sense a bit immune to it, because, quite frankly, the way in which this parliament operates from day to day does not provide the high standards of fairness and equal treatment that we believe it ought to exhibit.</PARA>

<PARA>That was not the only incident. In fact, there have been a number of incidents which, when looked at together, build up a picture whereby the operations of this parliament, rather than being treated on a fair and even-handed basis, have been used and abused for the political benefit of this government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the parliament is not for us individually; it is for our constituents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a dissent motion which, on every basis of fairness and on the basis of the standing orders, ought to be passed by this House. As the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith) said, unquestionably, those who close their mind and follow the lead of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this debate will back him up, therefore back up his influence over the Speaker and therefore try to ensure that the Speaker is not held to account for what should be the Speaker's prime responsibility in this chamber&mdash;to make sure that he enforces the standing orders on an even-handed and honest basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as the Manager of Opposition Business also said, there is no question, regardless of how the people on that side are directed to vote, what the outcome of this particular debate should be. This is a debate where the Speaker's ruling is patently wrong. It is the Speaker's ruling in relation to a point of order that was taken by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) under standing order 304A. The honourable member for Bendigo said that, in view of standing order 304A, the Prime Minister had engaged in disorderly conduct. He drew the attention of the Speaker to that disorderly conduct and asked the Speaker to operate and act under that rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Speaker's ruling was that there was no point of order. In the first place, he did not actually even try to take on the argument of the member for Bendigo&mdash;and he should have. But, in the second place, if he had taken it on, if he had applied the rule in relation to disorderly conduct, he could have come to only one conclusion, namely, the suspension of the Prime Minister, and he could have come to only one conclusion because the Speaker had given a ruling on this very point in these very circumstances in this very week. There was no question about that. It was vivid in everybody's mind. It should have been vivid in the Speaker's mind. That is why the opposition and the member for Bendigo quite rightly took it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of regret for us that the Speaker is not in the chair during the conduct of this debate. This is a very serious debate about the Speaker's ruling. The Speaker ought to be here. The Speaker ought to be listening to this. He ought to be taking on board the arguments that are made and the arguments in relation to the standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few other points. One is that, in relation to the episode of events which led up to the Prime Minister's conduct, both sides were on a general warning. There is no question about that. If you go through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> when it is published, you will see that both sides were on a general warning. The Speaker had gone to great lengths to make it clear to the government benches that there was a general warning in relation to them, as there was in relation to the opposition. I remember it well. It is so rarely done by the Speaker when he gives a general warning that he makes sure that the general warning applies to that side of the parliament as well as to this side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A general warning meant that every single person in the chamber from the time of that general warning was on notice that any disorderly conduct would result in a suspension. Anybody who had been here on Monday&mdash;and the Prime Minister had been here on Monday&mdash;was on notice as to what the Speaker regarded as disorderly. If there is any doubt about it, it was actually clarified by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) at page 594 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as to why the suspension rule had been invoked against me on Monday. It was taken up by the Leader of the Opposition. The Speaker said that when leave was granted to me to table documents, the documents were thrown across the chamber. What he meant, of course was that they were thrown across to the Prime Minister's desk. He said these words&mdash;and you focus on these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that that is the appropriate way in which members in this place should perform.</PARA>
<PARA>If it was not appropriate for me, it is not appropriate for the Prime Minister. If it is not appropriate on this side of the parliament, it is not appropriate on that side of the parliament. The Speaker ought to be the person who ensures that the rules are upheld. You cannot have an umpire in a football game who plays them in some circumstances to one team but will not play them to the other. This is a responsible position of Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to this House that there can be no confidence in the operation of this House whilst there is no confidence that the Speaker can independently enforce the standing orders. We know why there can be no confidence in the Speaker to enforce those standing orders. As the Manager of Opposition Business indicated in his speech, it all goes back to his position&mdash;his position of beholdenness to the Prime Minister for his appointment. If there was any doubt about that, the Prime Minister, just to make sure the Speaker remembered it, gave him a whack&mdash;`a backhander', as it was described in the press&mdash;at the caucus meeting. As is reported in the press accounts of 29 March 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has blamed the Speaker's inability to control the Parliament for his flawed public image, further undermining the authority of his position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating told Caucus yesterday that the failure of the Speaker, Mr Martin, and his deputy to quell the noise during Question Time had contributed to his image problems.</PARA>
<PARA>I will tell you what contributes to the Prime Minister's image problem: the way in which he seeks to make the Speaker beholden to him. That is a much worse problem for his image. If this Prime Minister could sit and behave as Prime Ministers in the past have behaved, if he could accept independent rulings and if he could bring himself to abide by even-handed enforcement, he would not have that kind of image problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first error is that he will not accept that, and he compounds it with a second error. Because he will not accept independent rulings, he compounds it by making the Speaker beholden to him as well. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MPs said they were surprised by the attack, describing it as a `very clear backhander' to Mr Martin, who is in Madrid . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Let us make clear how all this comes about, why the Speaker finds himself in this impossible position and why it was that he was forced to make such a clear error in the enforcement of the standing orders earlier. This is occurring because this parliament is grinding to a halt over the Lawrence affair, because the Prime Minister will not enforce standards. That is what is happening in this parliament. Because the Prime Minister will not enforce standards against the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and because he will not stand the minister aside pending the outcome of the commission, this parliament is grinding to a halt. You are seeing it in the performance last night when the House lapsed, you are seeing it in the efforts of the Speaker, and you are seeing it in the Prime Minister's behaviour this afternoon&mdash;behaviour which, I would put to this House, has probably never been seen in this House before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister gets up and reads from the actual transcript of a commission which is still continuing, which is in progress, and gives, by the inflection of his voice and his side comments, his opinion. The way in which he was giving his opinion could not be calculated to do anything other than to influence the commissioner in the discharge of his duties. There would be no other reason for the Prime Minister to be quoting the commissioner's decisions, no other reason to be quoting counsel and no other reason for the inflection, than to influence the outcome of that commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had a ruling by the Speaker&mdash;which I believe the Speaker will, in due course, have to countermand himself&mdash;to allow the Prime Minister to proceed, that any issue which was a public matter could be relied upon in this House. When I questioned him on when it became a public matter, the essence of his decision was that it was a public matter if it was in the transcript. A commission always produces a transcript. A superior court always produces a transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That ruling means that, in relation to any question in any court of law or in any commission, any member of this House who can get hold of that transcript can then say it is in the public domain, can then read it out and can then comment&mdash;presumably under absolute privilege, and presumably free from any attempt to enforce contempt laws. It is a new doctrine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was that new doctrine promulgated? It was promulgated to protect the Prime Minister who had gone wrong. Instead of pulling up the Prime Minister who goes wrong, the Speaker allows him to go, and the rulings become more bizarre by the minute. They became more bizarre by the minute in relation to the point of order that was taken by the member for Bendigo. That is the kind of trouble you get yourself into if you want to rip up the rule book. And in relation to conduct and ministerial standards, the rules get ripped up one after the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today it is Lawrence. Tomorrow it is the courts. Now it is enforcement of the standing orders. It is a morass into which this government is sinking because it cannot cut itself free. The only thing that will stop this House sinking into that morass is if the Speaker can stand up and pull it back. If we lose in this House the independence of the Speaker and the capacity of the Speaker to draw a line and say `this far and no further' there will be no rules in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be new doctrines in this House. There will be changed attitudes to commissions, changed attitudes to ministerial standards and, I have to tell you, changed attitudes to question time. If this side of the House can have no confidence in the standing orders being enforced independently, we can have no confidence in question time. We can have no confidence in the fact that if we come in and perform our role we will, within the even-handed and independent enforcement of standing orders, be entitled to do so. That is the morass that this Prime Minister is sucking this parliament into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And, oh, didn't we hear all about it on Monday when we sought to draw his attention to the speech and I stood here and passed it across to his side of the table. Didn't we hear all about it from the Prime Minister. He went into the caucus meeting and he instructed the caucus members that they had to kick up a fuss about it. Oh, yes, he did. He instructed them that they had to make as much mileage out of it as they possibly could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He attacked the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> because it would not publish photographs. I hope the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> is publishing photographs tomorrow, and I hope Michael Gordon is writing about it tomorrow with all the outrage he can muster. I hope the ABC, with all of the outrage they can muster, will be writing about the Prime Minister tonight. I hope that all of those media outlets that have been going on with their general moral outrage are concerned about the moral outrage today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I will tell you that it is a double moral outrage. It is a double moral outrage because this is now no longer a question of throwing leaflets across a desk. This is a question as to whether standards are going to be enforced in an independent and even-handed way. And that is a much greater question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the throwing of documents across this table has been done a lot of times in the past. I have done it. The Prime Minister has done it. The key point is this: on Monday, the Speaker said no-one else should do it on pain of suspension. Three days later, we find it was not a ruling that no-one should do it, on pain of suspension; it was a ruling that no-one except the Prime Minister should do it, on pain of suspension. Or maybe it was a ruling that nobody except the Labor Party should do it, on pain of suspension. Or maybe it was a ruling that nobody on this side of the House should do it. Maybe the ruling was actually that a right-handed pass across is unacceptable and a left-handed pass back is acceptable. Maybe that was the ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I tell you this: there is no logic, there is no defensibility&mdash;despite all the huffing and bluffing that Thomas the Tank Engine will now get up and show us at the dispatch box&mdash;and there is no basis at all on which there can be a distinguishment. Therefore, when you look at the merits, when you go to the record, when you go to the standing orders, and when you go to the transcript, there is no basis at all for this Prime Minister not being suspended today. There is no basis whatsoever other than that the Speaker failed in his duty. And, as the Speaker failed in his duty, this House should thoroughly and absolutely dissent from his ruling. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me draw instantly and immediately the distinction between the behaviour in which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition engaged and the behaviour in which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) engaged, which members have frequently had recourse to in this parliament when members have asked to take a look at this or that document or, even if they have not asked to take a look at it, they have had it volunteered from the other side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this chamber have sat here repeatedly over the years and seen instances where documents were tossed across one side of the House or the other. Generally speaking, they are documents of this description. Since he will not pass it back to me, I will use an equivalent piece of paper. The difference between these two propositions&mdash;the one in which the Prime Minister was involved when he tossed this piece of paper, or a piece of paper exactly the same, and when a bundle of documents was thrown across the table at him on Monday&mdash;was simply this: leave had been sought by the deputy leader to table those documents. Unusually, because the government does not normally give leave to table documents&mdash;we are not unique in that regard; that has been general practice in this House&mdash;we gave him permission to table the documents. It was a large, thick, heavy transcript of materials from a press conference presentation by Carmen Lawrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In giving permission for the deputy leader to table them, there is a distinct process. The process of tabling, for those who are at all interested in this debate, is that, when permission to table is given, you pass it to the clerk or, in the case of the opposition, the deputy clerk. That is what normally happens when you table a document. That is the orderly process of tabling a document. What did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do when invited to go through the normal processes of tabling a document? Rather than passing those documents to the clerk, which is the only appropriate way to table documents, having been given permission to do it, he lined up the Prime Minister, leaned across the table, and tossed them at him. That is precisely what he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister did, as far as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was concerned, was not to table the document. He was not in the process of tabling a document. The Leader of the Opposition had asked him a question about where he was securing his material from. The Prime Minister said, `All this material is in a newspaper,' and then he tossed that newspaper&mdash;one page of it&mdash;across the table to the Leader of the Opposition. It is over that which the opposition is in here expressing a bit of exceptional unction and hypocritical cant when it comes to behaviour in this parliament. </PARA>

You get the Leader of the Opposition now being given virtually permanent licence to heckle, to interject, and it takes a great deal before a Speaker is prepared to call him to book. Leaders of the opposition have benefited enormously from the generous treatment by successive Labor Speakers in that regard as well. Nobody who has served in the chamber on both sides of the House, as I have, could say otherwise when they review their experience in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on one matter in what he had to say: the issues in this House have not been advanced by the existence of that royal commission in Western Australia. The House has not been advanced by that for one very specific reason: what we have seen emanate from the executive in Western Australia is the Star Chamber. What the opposition, which claims great parliamentary standards, seems to fail to remember is this: the entire process of parliamentary privilege, the entire process of the protection of parliamentary debate, stemmed from an unwillingness by the parliament of the day to contemplate the ability of the judiciary to extend effectively royal commission powers to its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it was Speaker Lenthall who got up and said a statement which I think all members of the House would be aware of: `I have neither eyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor mouth to speak, except as the House of Commons dictates to me'. Who he said that to was the King's enforcers and who he was protecting were Messrs Pym and others in parliament at the time who were to be subject, for words they had said in parliament, to the attention of effectively a royal commission. What happened to them when they made those statements was they were locked up in the tower and then they were handed over to commissioners in the Star Chamber to be interrogated without normal rules of evidence, without rights of defence&mdash;all of the things which persist in the creation of a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House do not accept the conspiracy&mdash;a conspiracy now described as `liaison'&mdash;between the opposition frontbench and Mr Court to put in place a royal commission with completely unprecedented terms of reference, with terms of reference that, first, are highly political and, secondly, then proceed from being highly political to being grossly unfair in what can be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget where all this comes from. This comes from a parliamentary answer by the Prime Minister to questioning from the other side of the House on precisely those unfair terms of reference. Those opposite stood up in this place and questioned the Prime Minister and criticised, effectively, via their questions, the Prime Minister for introducing the fact into this chamber that there were a series of representations made in parliament going to family law matters and others related to the issues that subsequently turned up in the royal commission as terms of reference but not included in those terms of reference. That was what the Prime Minister was dealing with here. He has been answering a persistent line of questioning on this royal commission from the opposition since this royal commission has been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now just dawning on the general public and on the media who have been handling this that there are things afoul in this royal commission. It is just beginning to get through that the government has some sound reasons for wanting to stand this process up and for standing beside their minister. They are sound reasons that have probably been emphasised by the very dignified conduct of the former justice minister in WA, David Smith, before that royal commission when he said, `No matter what might happen to me, though indeed I have been referred to the Attorney-General by the royal commissioner, I will stand by parliamentary privilege; I will stand by cabinet confidentiality; I will not permit myself to be questioned in a way that breaches my ministerial oath; and I will not dignify what is an attack on the fundamental democratic institutions which dictates these proceedings.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I agree 100 per cent with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on this. This parliament has been degraded by the processes of that royal commission and its interests are not advanced by the debates that have taken place in this House on the processes of that royal commission. He is completely correct in that regard. But he is incorrect when he says that any substandard behaviour in this House emanates from that or that it is an example of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extraordinary latitude&mdash;decently based, I might say, but extraordinary latitude&mdash;has been given to the opposition to create mayhem in this place. They know darn well too that they have from time to time conducted their tactic meetings to achieve precisely that effect. They know absolutely that that is what their intention has been in that regard. Having made those points, rejecting completely the opposition's assignation to the government of responsibility for standards in this place, let me return to the original point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of latitude given in this debate in your absence, Mr Speaker, to the variety of issues that ought to be raised. Let me go back to the basic point of your ruling which started this dissent process. There is an absolute difference between a situation where permission is granted to a member of the opposition, or any other member for that matter, to formally table documents and what has been a general pattern of behaviour, not in throwing documents at people, but in tossing them either side of that desk, which has persistently been the case in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do it every time I get up and introduce a bill. I stand up and introduce a bill. I have an element of that bill which is usually the explanatory notes associated with it. When the bill is presented, I pick up the alternative notes, I toss them across the table to the opposition frontbencher sitting there and the opposition frontbencher receives that material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular instance, the opposition leader was questioning the sources of the Prime Minister's quotes, questioning whether or not they had been public documents. The Prime Minister picked up a piece of paper this big and tossed it across the chamber to the Leader of the Opposition. There is an absolute difference between that and picking up a thick document&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The point of order has to do with the sub judice rule. It is not a dissent from your previous ruling, but it is to put to you a new argument in relation to the Prime Minister's current answer that he has now resumed. Under his current approach to the royal commission, he has, as you have seen, commenced to read details from the transcript. You have said that you believe he can do that because it is on the public record. Sir, if that ruling was to remain the precedent in this House for sub judice, then that would be an extremely dangerous situation. The point of order I wish to make is backed by precedent. If you indulge me, I would like to read to you some notes from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

If John Halden&mdash;that paragon of virtue, that pillar of parliamentary practice&mdash;is to be believed, the Minister for Communications and the Arts is guilty of contempt of this parliament. He must go to the Bills and Papers Office immediately and present that petition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me address a few matters in my electorate. The best possible thing that can happen for Campbelltown is the rejuvenation of the public housing estates. Putting so much public housing together in the city of Campbelltown was never going to work. Last year I approached the New South Wales Department of Housing with a plan to improve the appearance of the estates which will eventually see up to 70 per cent of the housing sold to private owners to ensure a better mix of public and private housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next five to 10 years the whole nature of Claymore, Airds, Minto and Glenquarie in my electorate will change. No-one will be forced from their homes and some people will even have the chance to buy their own property. This can only be a very good thing for people living in these estates and indeed for everyone living in the city of Campbelltown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the current local government election campaign, this project has been put at risk through a scare campaign orchestrated by two Campbelltown council candidates: Walid Baba and Michael El Khoury. They have distributed literature, authorised by Mr Ali Kammoun of 1 Woollybutt Place, Macquarie Fields, which claims:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a resident of the Department of Housing estate you will probably know that your area is about to undergo a major facelift. What you have not been told is that, after your homes are transformed when the estate becomes an attractive place to live, 70 per cent of you will either be moved out or added to someone's private rent roll.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the same Mr Kammoun who ran against me at the Werriwa by-election last year under the campaign directorship of Liverpool's Liberal councillors, Tony Pascale and Tom Glavich. This leaflet is designed to scare public housing residents into believing that their homes will be snatched from them. What they do not seem to understand is that many residents are unhappy living in these areas and are keen to move to better housing and be closer to transport, closer to jobs and closer to other services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What these candidates do not seem to understand is that there are substantial benefits to residents who will be able to buy their own home. They have not taken into account that between 1986 and 1991 in Australia more than 50 per cent of people moved house. The normal turnover in these areas is very high. These candidates do not care about the repercussions that inaccurate comments have on the community. They have not bothered to find out the facts or what residents of these estates actually require. In truth, the transition from public to private can be and should be seamless. Over a five- to 10-year period it can be managed with major benefits to Campbelltown and benefits for each of the residents of the public housing estates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a low moment in the politics of Campbelltown municipality when candidates for the local government election on 9 September are using a scare campaign to try to win votes&mdash;to try to scare people, public housing tenants in my electorate, with the fear of eviction and with the fear of being thrown onto the street. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a campaign conducted by Mr Baba and Mr El Khoury, authorised by Mr Kammoun, which is totally unworthy of Campbelltown's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All candidates standing in the Campbelltown local government elections should support the plan being devised by the local member and the state minister, Craig Knowles, and indeed supported by me as the federal member for the city of Campbelltown. This is a very good plan. This is one of the best things that have been developed for the future of Campbelltown. I call on all candidates contesting the election on 9 September to support the plan. Local government has a very important role to play by virtue of improvements in the open space and the public land associated with these estates and the integration of public housing estates in Campbelltown with privately owned areas and indeed with the entire fabric of Campbelltown's community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear all of what the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) had to say, but I rushed down so I could make a few comments about the efforts of the honourable member for Warringah, both in his own constituency and throughout the nation, in his great campaign against mobile telephone towers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I think I have probably had more letters and questions on notice from the honourable member than from anyone else on this issue. He might think that that is therefore the badge of courage, that he is standing up for his constituents. But I have probably received even more letters, from people such as the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), demanding that Telecom put up more towers, and perhaps other National Party members, who are saying that Telecom does not do enough in putting up towers to extend the coverage of&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Cowper interjects to say, `There are many holes in the net,' and that is why the telephone companies argue that they should be spending more money to provide better coverage for mobile telephones across the country. But the point the honourable member seeks to make is that more people should be tabling petitions from people from other members' electorates. My attitude has always been that, if the constituents of another honourable member provide me with petitions, I forward the petitions to their local member to table. If the state member for Manly prepares and circulates a petition in his electorate against some issue, then I always encourage him, as I do other state members, to table the petition in his state house, as I think is the proper thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have to warn honourable members about is that there are some people&mdash;not just members of parliament, but councillors&mdash;who are seeking to use this issue to get a bit of publicity in their own electorates. I have a sneaking suspicion that the honourable member for Warringah is one of the people who think that this is a nice issue that they can use to their own political advantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Chief Government Whip might think that I am being a little bit too cynical in being suspicious of the motives of the member for Warringah, but let me just point out a few facts to the member for Warringah and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the Liberal Party voted to exempt the telephone companies from the state planning laws. Your party voted to allow the carriers to put up the telephone tower and the radiators at Harbord. Your party voted to allow the carriers to be exempt from the state planning laws. This is the thing that you now claim is a great outrage, but it was your party&mdash;and my party, to be honest; government and opposition&mdash;that voted against the Democrat amendments not to give them the exemption. So I think it is the height of hypocrisy for the member for Warringah to come in here and whip up campaigns in his own electorate to suggest that he is against mobile telephone towers, when it was his party that voted to let the carriers be exempt from the state planning laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it was the government that last year moved to tighten the requirements on the telephone companies. I put through a proposal, an amendment to the telecommunications national code, to say that, if there is no agreement between the local council and the telephone company, it gets referred to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency to be the arbitrator. Before my amendments, the carriers could do what they liked but, because of the changes we made last year, it now goes to CEPA as the umpire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Which was the party that threatened to block my attempts to tighten the procedures? The Liberal Party. Senator Alston was trailing his coat around the Senate, looking for support to block the Labor Party's measures and to tighten the environmental rules on the telephone companies. Again, it is the height of hypocrisy for the member for Warringah to come into this House and say that he has tried to stop the telephone companies putting up towers, when it was his party that was looking for support in the Senate to try to stop the government from tightening the requirements on the telephone companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply make the point that there are some people, like me, who think the rules should be tightened. Some people suggest that we should abolish the exemption that the carriers now have&mdash;and the member for Warringah says that he might be sympathetic to that point of view. What you do not understand is that some of the state environmental planning laws are weaker than the telecommunications national code. The telecommunications national code is stronger than some of the state planning laws. That is why I have asked Austel, in cooperation with CEPA, to conduct a review into this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point I make is simply this: yes, there are some people who do not like a mobile telephone tower to be constructed near their home. Everyone likes to protect the value of their property. A lot of people think that nothing should ever be built in their own backyard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if the honourable member for Warringah is telling me that he thinks no telephone tower should be built anywhere in Australia when any of the local residents are opposed to it&mdash;which is the case in his electorate&mdash;then what does he tell the members of the National Party who send letters to me and come in here and argue that there should be more towers built?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. In conclusion, I simply make the point that, under the standing orders, there is a fair opportunity for a minister to respond to outrageous statements that are made during the adjournment, and I will take every opportunity to exercise my right of reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would make to the honourable member for Warringah is: if you are serious about trying to make sure that people do get a fair deal in looking at proposals to put up new towers, why are you not trying to work with us as part of the Austel review? Why are you not trying to sit down with us, in a commonsense way, and see if we can work out procedures that give local communities a chance to have their say?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell you that the procedures that now apply are tougher on the telephone companies&mdash;and they are tougher on the telephone companies now because my department and this government tightened the rules last July. They are much tighter than the rules that your party agreed to in the Senate when the Telecommunications Act was passed some time ago. The reason they are tighter is that we thought it was important that, if councils could not reach agreement with the telephone companies, that would mean there should be an independent arbitrator&mdash;and what fairer arbitrator could you have on environmental issues than the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency? And they are the rules that apply now. I suspect from the quizzical look on the face of the honourable member for Warringah that he never understood that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He might not understand it, as the Chief Government Whip interjects. But I make the point: honourable members who want to contribute to this debate should try hard to learn what the rules are. It is important that, if we are concerned about what the environmental rules are for the erection of telephone towers, people put forward submissions to Austel in the review it is now conducting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to tell honourable members that, in their negotiations with the Municipal Association of Victoria, all three carriers have been prepared, I think, to make some concessions to ensure that there is proper community consultation and an opportunity for contribution by the community. In fact, I am currently writing to all local councils in Australia for the second time to advise them of their rights and responsibilities to raise issues with Austel, to have issues referred to CEPA as the umpire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I also have to tell honourable members that there will be occasions when local communities do not want towers built. It is not unusual to have people who live closest to a proposed mobile telephone tower to be against the tower's erection. There are other communities which ask that the tower perhaps be moved to a less obvious location, or that the tower be adjusted in some way so it is less obvious from a visual standpoint. In most cases, councils and telephone companies can reach agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do get a little bit angry when local councillors seek to use this as an election issue in the lead-up to local council elections and when members of parliament, federal or state, seek to inflame fear and misunderstanding in the community about these issues. What we have to say is, if this is a such a big issue, if the member for Warringah thinks that no mobile towers should be built anywhere where the local communities are opposed to it, what that is saying is that there will be no more mobile towers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply ask the honourable member for Warringah: does he have a mobile phone? No answer. So we can simply conclude from that that perhaps the honourable member for Warringah is quite happy to use a mobile phone. If he really wants to prove to us that he is against this technology because he has concerns about the impact it might have on health or the environment, then why does he not make the supreme sacrifice and hand his taxpayer funded mobile telephone back into the parliamentary offices? If he does have an objection in principle to these devices, I give him the challenge: hand your mobile telephone back in, prove to us that you will get by with fixed wire telephony rather than using mobile telephones, and make that contribution to your electorate. </PARA>
