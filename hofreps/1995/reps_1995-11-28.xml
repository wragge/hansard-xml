The matter concerned the publication in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 29 October of material said to reveal the deliberations of the joint committee on a report which had not been presented to either House at the time. The honourable member informed the House that the committee had determined that the action in question had interfered with the proper running of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday, 22 November in the House the honourable member for Stirling referred to the difficulties being experienced with the POWER computer system and asked me to report back on a number of issues. It is not possible to identify how many complaints have been received specifically about the POWER platform, although I have been advised by the Parliamentary Information Systems Office that on Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, during the time difficulties were being experienced with POWER, a total of 143 calls were received by the PISO help desk inquiring about the unavailability of computing services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first installation of the POWER platform in the parliament occurred over 18 months ago and since that time POWER has been installed progressively across the building. PISO has reported that in the past 12 months during business hours approximately 25 hours have been lost through the unavailability of POWER, out of a total of 2,600 scheduled hours available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that occurred last Tuesday and Wednesday related to a deficiency in the network management software supplied by the Digital Equipment Corporation. The software failed due to the large number of users that were connected to the system. PISO staff, in collaboration with Digital engineers in Canberra, Sydney and the United States, have been investigating the problem but, to date, no software solution has been found. Last week PISO further reduced the load on the central processors supporting members' and senators' offices. Steps are also being taken to upgrade capacity and, over the weekend, an additional processor was installed to support members' and senators' requirements. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendments be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>The government rejects the opposition's amendments to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) because they deny funding of the $50 million required to provide an additional 5,000 places for the higher education sector. This funding is an integral part of the government's higher education package, a package which was worked out in close consultation with the higher education sector, and which recognises the priorities of the sector: additional student places and research infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to providing additional places in universities in this country. Since 1983, the total number of students has increased by 73 per cent&mdash;from 349,000 to 604,000 in 1995. In the most recent budget, we made a commitment to provide an additional 11,000 places, including the pipeline effect. These places are for those Australians who have not had the opportunity to go to university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said when the budget was handed down, the places were always conditional upon the savings measures within the package being passed. I make that point because it has been asserted in the other place that this conditionality was never spelt out. I remind the Queensland opposition members of what I said in this House when we introduced the legislation and what I said in my second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any attempt to unravel this package or to introduce amendments which reduce revenue raising aspects will mean that the government is forced to reconsider its announcement of additional places allocated to Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>You cannot get clearer than that. That was in the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that in the public domain the opposition preaches fiscal rectitude but seeks to unravel for cheap political effect a balanced budget package that is revenue neutral in terms of the higher education sector. The opposition's amendments to the proposed legislation deny the budget package $50 million&mdash;I repeat the figure, because the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), when I heard him in the House on a previous occasion, quoted a lower figure&mdash;over three years. That is what is denied. These are the simplest saving measures imaginable, because they do not disadvantage existing Australian students. All the proceeds that are obtained go not to government revenue but to expanding the higher education sector. So it is money put back into the system to expand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Denying the savings means a loss of up to 5,000 places or cuts to research infrastructure. This is what the opposition in the Senate is proposing, and the public ought to be aware of it. The opposition's amendments are an act of sheer hypocrisy, because the opposition has accepted the principles which underlie the government's proposed changes. It accepts the introduction of intermediate repayment rates for HECS and it accepts that those students who choose not to become Australian citizens should pay their HECS fees up front. The opposition is not opposing the measures; it is merely delaying their implementation, and that is where we lose the savings. By their very amendments, these same things will apply to any student enrolling after 1 January next year, and that is discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition talks about its stance being taken on a non-discriminatory basis. In fact, it is discriminating between existing students and future students. It also says that it is protecting existing students, but the effect of its amendments is to deny future students access to extra places and facilities. In terms of its concern for students, it should be noted that not one Australian student is disadvantaged by the government package and there is no increase in fees and charges for students. I make that point because yesterday on radio in Townsville Senator Ian Macdonald, one of the cabal of people stopping these measures, said in defence of the opposition's position that the Labor Party is trying to increase fees and charges on existing students. This is an absolute untruth, because nothing in the measures that we are proposing increases fees and charges on students. Senator Ian Macdonald, in defence of his party's position, either is being deliberately misleading or does not understand what he is supporting. In either case, he is negligent as a senator for that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The misleading argument does take on a bit of currency when I remind the House that the same Senator Macdonald was the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure who put out the briefing paper to his shadow cabinet in support of an infrastructure fund when he talked about the third major element in his portfolio being infrastructure. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with proposals in infrastructure is how to give us the flexibility to campaign properly without being so specific as to lock us into particular projects which then of necessity must rule out others.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another example of this senator's deceit and he is using it on this occasion, I believe, to distort and justify their position. I repeat the point that the only students who will suffer as a result of the opposition's stance in this are those who are going to be denied places at or facilities in which to study. It is a shameful performance on the part of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another myth that has been put forward in defence of their position is that by requiring non-citizens to pay their HECS fee up-front we are somehow discriminating against non-citizens. The simple fact is this, and I again ask the members who are going to be affected potentially by this to understand this point very clearly: at the moment all Australian citizens are required to repay their HECS once they reach average weekly earnings; non-citizens, however&mdash;people who can come to this country and over three years obtain a degree, then return home without ever earning an income in this country&mdash;can avoid paying their HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure will simply ensure that position does not happen, that we make non-citizens repay HECS as we require Australian citizens to repay their level of HECS. The reason? Again, not because the money comes back to the Commonwealth but because the money that comes from the repaid HECS goes straight into the higher education system. It has been one of the important means by which we have been able to fund the expansion of that system. So it is a debt that is not returned to the government; it is a debt that is returned to ensure the expansion of the higher education system. This second measure, the non-stepped HECS measure, if you like, simply ensures that students who are non-citizens repay their HECS debt in the same way as Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that have been passed by the Senate will establish arbitrary and inequitable distinctions between individuals who have a HECS debt. It is the equivalent of having different taxation scales for individuals who commence employment at different times. These distinctions would be extremely complex to administer and would cost the Commonwealth up to an additional $2 million annually and $1 million per year thereafter to implement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the logic in the opposition's position? That is the question that this House has to ask itself because, quite frankly, I can find none. Not only is there no logic in their attack on the budget but they claim they are looking after the interests of students. But they do not have the support of the students themselves. The National Union of Students has indicated that it does not regard the changes to HECS payments as having a direct impact on access to higher education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An important tome! Why do you not suggest that to the member who represents that area from your side? The Gold Coast is up in arms over the position your party has adopted because it is the Gold Coast that will suffer most from the cutback in places. That is where the growth area has been in Queensland. If you do not understand that, it is probably because your bus broke down before it got across the border. The president of the NUS is reported as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students are not concerned that they would be required to pay their HECS debt sooner under the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the member for Hinkler to pay particular regard to this, as I do the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth). South Australia could also suffer in terms of places if these measures are not passed. This is what the NUS is saying: they are not concerned that they would be required to repay their HECS debt sooner under the legislation. They are more concerned about the loss of so many tertiary places Australia-wide if the Senate refused to change its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take note of those words. If you do not believe me, be prepared to listen to what the NUS has said. I understand that your leader in the Senate finally took a call from the NUS and it ended up in a screaming match. The NUS does not believe that your party is listening to them. Yet you come into this place expressing mock concern for the students of the country. Even if you believe you are representing present students, think about the future ones because they deserve the opportunity to get these extra places. Yet those opposite are over there claiming to represent students in this exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NUS has not lobbied the opposition to introduce these amendments on their behalf. On the contrary, they have indicated to the opposition that they do not oppose the HECS repayment schedule if what it is going to do is produce the places, which we have ensured it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as a government have honoured our commitment to students of this country. We have not increased the HECS debt. We have maintained the first repayment threshold at average weekly earnings. We did not reallocate existing places from the other states, such as South Australia and Victoria, which was the real concern those states had. They were overrepresented in places. Queensland was underrepresented. A simple solution would be to redress the inequality by redistributing. I avoided that by giving Queensland its extra places without any coming off South Australia and without any coming off Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these measures go through on the part of your party, it is those states' positions that will have to be looked at again because my commitment is to delivering to Queensland. They are the ones who have been let down in the past and they are the ones that we will ensure get looked after in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other commitment we have made in terms of the students is that we have not introduced up-front fees for undergraduate students. When the opposition is put to the test, they say in the other house with all of this great hypocrisy that they will fund the places and they will deliver them on schedule. How are they going to do that? We have the shadow Treasurer saying on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> on 19 November that if the coalition won government they would introduce a surplus of $5 billion. He said that the Liberal Party is not interested in increasing taxes. If you can believe that, you then have to accept the view that they can only do it by expenditure cuts. I might say, they refer to their $5 billion surplus as a true surplus, net of the asset sales&mdash;the asset sales they are denying in the other place as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, how can any reasonable, thinking person get to the point where there is justification or opportunity for expenditure increases? It simply does not exist. The fact is that you cannot believe them. They cannot be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also said in their press release on 22 November following rejection in the Senate that they would deliver these places on schedule. How can they do it? The simple fact is that the election will not be held until next year. The call for places has to go out within the next month. In the case of Queensland, I think, the places have to be announced mid-January. I think it is somewhat earlier in South Australia, if I am not mistaken. So how can the opposition get away with saying that it will deliver the places on schedule when the universities need to know now what they have got available? I think after this exercise in stupidity in the other house there will be a lot of people who may have thought of voting for that crowd thinking again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students in Queensland have finished their year 12 exams, which are equivalent to the HSC exams. They are the students who were given hope by our announcement some months ago&mdash;hope that, for the first time, they would have a real opportunity to get into university in that state. They are the students who have worked hard against that background, with the expectation that their opportunity for access to university education would increase in line with what has been expected in the rest of the country. It is those hopes that have now been dashed. The budget package meant that all states, including Queensland, would achieve equivalent participation rates over the next four years. Without those places, Queensland remains well below the national average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Robert Hill's point about being able to guarantee expenditure must be seen against the background of the comments made by the shadow Treasury spokesman to do with expenditure cuts. I know what will happen when it comes to a party room contest and who will win out. Robert Hill will not win that argument. He could not even win preselection in his own state. Let us understand the credibility with which he comes to the party in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deliver the places to Queensland without the budget package will require either a reallocation of places from the states that have been overrepresented or a cut-back in terms of the research infrastructure. Even if we can accommodate places, it means the facilities will have to be reduced. That is what your position stands for. You need to understand that, and you should be prepared to be honest enough to accept that you have been misled by your leader in the other house&mdash;who is also your spokesman for education&mdash;and that some correction is now needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments do not represent the wishes of students. Queensland opposition members in this parliament in particular should listen to what their constituents are telling them, and I notice that there is not one opposition member from Queensland in this House now. These are the people who run around the country saying that they want more places for Queensland&mdash;and, as soon as they get the opportunity to support something that will deliver that, they oppose it.

It was an attempt to tell students that they will not be able to get university places unless they pay for them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister goes around the country talking about no up-front fees for students.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is about putting the fees up further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In effect, it was retrospective. It was retrospective with respect to the contract that the government had entered into with the existing students. The government is now threatening to cut those places out of the system. Originally, when the minister spoke on this in the House, he said, `It will mean losses of places in Victoria and South Australia.' Then he woke up to the fact that the marginal seats are in Queensland and he said, `We will extend this campaign of fear and loathing to Queensland' and is threatening the students up there that they will not have places that the government has promised them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make a few points about this. If this government does cut these places, that will show its sense of priorities. It will not be a surprise to students that the government places very low priority on the provision of these additional places. We will certainly be making clear right through to those seats mentioned by the employment minister that he places very low priority on these additional places. Tens of thousands of students for many years have not been able to get places within the university system, even though they are qualified students. So we know the low priority that this government puts on these additional places. </PARA>

There will be a very clear contrast between us and the government, because we give very high priority to qualified students being able to get access to university.

For example, the National President of the NUS, Mr John Graham, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition have not addressed NUS's concerns with regards to ensuring that all people have access to higher education. Through their amendments they have cut substantial revenue to the system, whilst cynically opposing amendments from the Greens and Democrats which would have struck to the core of our equity concerns. What has been passed is a bandaid solution which only postpones the inequities.</PARA>
<PARA>Another NUS officer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NUS is concerned that without having addressed any of the real equity concerns the Coalition has cut off substantial revenue to the system. Within the Government's framework of a revenue neutral Budget package for higher education, this has the direct effect of cutting 5000 places to the system&mdash;a situation which is intolerable to students.</PARA>
<PARA>Stephen Beckett, the President of NUS in Queensland, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am absolutely furious at the fact that the Opposition dare do this to Queensland's tertiary education sector. For too long Queenslanders have been denied adequate tertiary education positions, as the southern states have received the bulk of tertiary funding. Queensland finally gets the places that it deserves, and the Opposition wants to play politics and deny Queenslanders, especially Queensland youth of their right to attend a tertiary institution. The Opposition should be ashamed of itself, and again I call for the sacking of the Opposition's incompetent education spokesman Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA>There says the NUS of Queensland and there go all your arguments. What the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said was that the NUS did not oppose these measures.

They are saying, `This is unfair. We can't cut this money out' as if somehow this $50 million was just going into general consolidated revenue and was not being returned to students. It is being returned to students to pay for extra tertiary places for Queenslanders.

The real problem for Labor is that the more they raise the profile the more obvious it will be to everyone that they are the ones who have failed Queensland university students. They are the ones who have for 13 years allowed this disparity to develop. They are the ones who could easily have funded the places if there had been a real commitment to education when the budget was put together. But, no, they are the great taxing party. Their only solution to all of these problems is new taxes. This new HECS tax&mdash;the second increase in the HECS payments in the life of this parliament&mdash;is another broken election promise.

But it seems there is no money for Queensland university places. Labor have no-one but themselves to blame for the current mess. Mr Nunn and all of the other state members who are trying to whip up this issue have no-one to blame but themselves. They have failed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give this assurance to the people of Wide Bay, who are anxiously waiting, after years and years, to have a university provided within our electorate, that we will have one, hopefully, by 1997. And, when that university college is constructed, the places will be funded by a coalition government. Those places will be there to give the students of my electorate a fair chance and that is a very important equity issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I often hear members opposite speak about the importance of social equity. Country students have only one-third as much chance of getting to university as people who live in capital cities like Canberra. That is why it is so essential that these places be provided and why, if Labor is serious about social equity, if it cares about the rights of those students who have been disadvantaged, if it cares about providing equal opportunities to students irrespective of which state they come from, Labor must fund these places. Their funding must be completely independent of whether or not this legislation should pass. The legislation needs to be considered on the basis of its merits and Labor clearly fails in that regard. It is the Labor government that is taking the places from Queensland. Let all students be aware of its culpability in this issue. </PARA>

They would rather people went to Victoria or somewhere else to get their university degrees.

I call on the Democrats to reconsider very seriously their position when this legislation returns to the other place. They need to come out because they are also up for election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week a United Trades and Labour Council document titled `1996 federal election planning' was leaked. Amongst the seven pages of details, the unions set out their plans to distort and disrupt the next federal election. The strategy spelt out was to develop a `third party' campaign of `fear and loathing' in the run-up to the next federal election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) this morning, it is just so obvious that the government cannot stand on its record nor can it stand on hope, so it must stand on fear and loathing. Since the 1993 election&mdash;when there was much fuss, fear, loathing and rallies&mdash;Labor has either introduced or attempted to introduce the following: double HECS for second undergraduate degrees; 1 1/2 times HECS for those taking longer than the minimum time to complete their degree; pro rata repayment, which was a method of substantially lowering the repayment threshold; lower repayment thresholds; increased rates of repayment; and altered methods of repayment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have heard the minister today and other speakers on the other side you would have thought that the government was the hero of the students.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member opposite interjects. I am simply reading to this place a letter from the President of the Students Association of the Adelaide University, which is in my electorate. The letter continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent government initiatives to win back the "youth vote" have largely ignored University students and graduates in the 19-24 age bracket. I would ask you what you have done to secure their futures? These proposals have also ignored the needs of "new to higher education" students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst we applaud any moves to meaningfully address the needs of Australian youth this cannot be achieved by ignoring the vast majority of young Australians involved in Higher Education. The Prime Minister has stated publicly that "education is our future". I ask you and the government to honour that pledge by responding to genuine student concerns and needs as evidenced in these formal protests.</PARA>
<PARA>In reading this letter, I am reminded of the demonstration that students from the same university made when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited Adelaide a few months ago and of his cruel jibe at the time of `Go get a job'. In South Australia there is very high youth unemployment. It is now over 40 per cent for 15- to 19-year-olds, but it has been written up and commented on publicly that the true tragedy is the fact that 20 per cent of 15- to 24-year-olds are unemployed&mdash;and that takes in a high number of graduates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not be congratulating itself. It should not be trying to attack the coalition over these amendments in the Senate. What is the coalition's position? The coalition believes that when students undertake their course they should be certain of their HECS repayment requirements. At the very least, the government must stop moving the goalposts as they relate to the repayment of a HECS debt. This is really all about changing the rules and changing the goalposts all the time, which cannot be said to be standing up for students and certainly not for those in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, upon coming to government, which will no doubt happen given the record of the government, has pledged that the student places will be reintroduced if Labor takes them from our universities, as the minister has threatened to do. He is changing the goalposts. A few weeks ago he was talking about taking 2,000 positions from South Australia and Victoria to ensure that Queensland did not suffer. Last week the figure was 5,000 and today it would seem that Queensland is to miss out because he has actually discovered that there are more marginal seats in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should be honest. Those opposite should be honest. But truth is really a bit of a casualty of the government. I notice that an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> some time ago on Mr Crean's claims that we are on track to cut unemployment to five per cent stated that at best he is deluded and at worst he is not telling the truth. There should be some honesty about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only National and Liberal Party senators but also Democrats and Greens cannot all be wrong and all government members right on this issue. The government cannot claim to be the only ones to be standing up for students. I think it is really a question of manipulation in quoting the NUS as representing all students. The shadow minister, who led this debate from our point of view, was able to quote from a different press release from NUS. Certainly I have this letter, which I have read in full, from the president of the Students Association of the University of Adelaide, in my own electorate. I think there should be some honesty in this argument. We do not want to see Queenslanders miss out on positions, and neither should Victoria or South Australia, as the government has threatened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that it does not have the money for these positions unless it actually takes HECS fees from those who are already in the system&mdash;in other words, moving the goalposts, collecting the money from those who undertook their studies when there was one set of rules, which may now change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has had money to fund very expensive legal fees for ministers who have got themselves into a bit of strife and it has had a lot of money to promote its own superannuation policy&mdash;flowerpots and lemons and all that sort of thing. Why should it be that money will be taken from one lot of students and graduates to give to others coming on? There is nothing very fair about that. The House should be reminded that some of those graduates who have now got jobs and are starting to repay HECS were due on 1 January 1996, which is not that far off, for tax relief which was l-a-w law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just quote a few facts because there have not been too many facts quoted in this debate. Since 1983 there has been a 73 per cent increase in the number of students undertaking higher education&mdash;from 349,000 in 1983, when we came to government, to 604,000 in 1995. That has been backed by real money&mdash;a nearly 70 per cent increase in real terms in the Commonwealth budget, from $3.1 billion in 1983 to $5.3 billion in 1995. That is the answer to the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total funding per student will reach a peak of $12,575 in 1996. Capital funding will be $284 million in 1997, an increase of over 440 per cent since 1983. Research funding will be $385 million in 1997, an increase of nearly 400 per cent since 1983. This is the government that has put real money and real commitment into providing higher education for Australians, including Queenslanders. Of course, what we have got here is an opposition that has not been able in three years to cobble together an education policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that without HECS 30 per cent of the students at universities in this country would not be there. That is where we have put equity into the system. The opportunity to defer the payments has allowed many more students of all ages to go into higher education. Simon Vandeerer, from the Council of Australian Postgraduate Association of Students, said on 20 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's proposals to change the Government's repayment schedule calls into question the Coalition's failure to release its own higher education policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition has also completely skated over the issue of why we would be asking non-citizens to pay their HECS up-front. The government believes that access to HECS benefits should be restricted to those higher education students who are Australian citizens and who have demonstrated a long-term commitment to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our legislation indicates that from January 1996 students who have been permanent residents in Australia for three years or more and who choose not to become Australian citizens, and New Zealand citizens who are also not Australian citizens, will be required to pay their HECS payments up-front. These students will continue to receive a substantial public subsidy of about 80 per cent towards the cost of their course. Who is paying these students? It is the working mums and dads of this country, my meatworkers and my railway workers. They are paying for the privilege of our young people to get an education. When the question is put to them that people who have had the advantage of a full public education and who can leave the country and go back to wherever they came from should be required to make some contribution up-front, I think they will answer that of course they should. I think it is an argument that will be well understood in my electorate. There is no problem from NUS. It wants to make sure that there are these increased student places. My university stands to lose 210 places in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nats run around in Central Queensland saying, `The government should do more here. The government should put more money in this.' The old National Party tactic is to pork-barrel its electorates. It throws a bucket of money here and a bucket of money there but does not worry about fiscal responsibility. At the same time, the shadow Treasurer is saying that we have to cut government debt and government expenditure. There is simply no integrity in policy on the opposition benches. All we have in the Senate is a lot of cheap political stunts. There was no consultation with students, the tertiary sector or the vice-chancellors association. They are trying to plan their higher education commitments for the next triennium, and they are hit with this political stunt from the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the amendments that the Senate has returned to the House of Representatives that should be supported. One of my constituents summed up the HECS problem most succinctly two years ago when he wrote to me and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am scared out of my wits about the HECS schemes. Messrs Keating and co can add to your debt at any time, raise interest on late payments et cetera.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's third amendment which has come back from the Senate is about the accelerated repayments. I remind the House that this is the third time that the government has attempted to introduce an accelerated repayment rate since HECS began operation. Two years ago I raised the same issues of certainty, the one-sided nature of the HECS contract and the fact that in this contract the government is the powerful proponent able to alter the contract. When the government introduces amendments to increase their repayments, you could hardly say that students two years through a law degree or three years through a medical degree should come along and say, `I can't afford it now, I will have to pull out,' completely ruining their futures. They cannot do that. They have to accept the change. They have no power in this contract to say to the government, `You're changing the ground rules and therefore we are going to pull out.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. Amendment No. 4 moved by the coalition is certainly worthy of discussion. Part 9 of this bill seeks to prevent overseas persons who undertake education in Australian tertiary institutions and then return overseas from leaving unpaid any HECS debts they may have incurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET figures show that 26,000 permanent residents are currently studying in Australian universities. It is estimated that around half of these meet the residency requirements that allow them to defer their HECS and that most of the remainder will take out citizenship by the 1996 academic year, leaving around only 2,200 liable for up-front fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure creates a number of concerns. At best, the amendment can only partially prevent rorting of the system. The amendment relates only to persons who have met the citizenship requirement of two years permanent residency, making it possible for students from overseas to complete a degree as a permanent resident before becoming eligible for citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is the point? Under this bill, overseas students from countries which permit dual citizenship&mdash;for example, Hong Kong&mdash;would have little difficulty in taking out Australian citizenship, returning to their country of origin and leaving their HECS debt unpaid. At the same time, the bill creates hardship for students from those countries&mdash;for example, Malaysia&mdash;which do not allow dual citizenship who may need to retain the citizenship of their original country for a variety of reasons. So we are creating two classes of overseas students in Australia: those who will be able to avoid the government's proposals and those who will have to make a choice and possibly suffer deleterious effects by doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has claimed that the amendment will save $1.8 million in this fiscal year and $3.8 million in 1997-98. It appears to me to be a particularly cumbersome method of saving what are relatively small amounts. When the potential for rorting the system still exists, it is considered that it may well be proved that even this much is unable to be matched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report that was recently tabled by the Australian National Audit Office stated that the Department of Social Security could save $86 million by changing some of the systems that it has adopted. The government is happy to punish students and make their lives almost impossible and is happy to have legislation which is still full of loopholes and which students will be able to get around&mdash;all for a measly $3.8 million and $1.8 million&mdash;when it would not even make those changes that would make DSS $86 million better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government takes students for granted. It has always done so. It relies on their support at election time, but between elections it kicks them in the guts. It is no surprise to us that it would oppose the amendments for that reason. Its policies in HECS and education have always advantaged those who can pay up-front fees. It has always advantaged the people at the top end of town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party claims to be the party of the battler, the party of the worker, yet its policies in this area only advantage the top end of town. It does not do anything for those students who are struggling to get to university and who cannot afford to pay up-front, which I find appalling from the Labor Party which claims to represent battlers and workers. You should hang your heads in shame that you advantage the privileged and the rich in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister criticised me in his speech earlier for getting around and listening to young people's concerns. A lot of those young people were students, a lot of them complaining about HECS and Austudy and all the other things that concern students. I would put it to him that it would not be a bad idea if he popped out on a bus and travelled around Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria hearing the concerns of young people in forums. We met over 1,200 young people and travelled over 4,000 kilometres. It might be different from when I was in Queensland on my bus and Minister Crean was flying into Cairns on his VIP jet and flying out after having a stage-managed production with a few young people, who were probably members of the Labor Party in any event. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Leichhardt in Far North Queensland, the Labor Party's record includes $15 million expended to build the James Cook University campus, plus $6 million from the state Labor government. It has been built, it is operational now and it will be officially opened next month. The Labor Party has also promised, under this legislation, 600 places for James Cook over the next two years&mdash;that is, James Cook at Cairns and Townsville. That is the Labor Party's record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the coalition's record? Nothing at all; zero; no commitment. In fact, rejecting this legislation will take away those extra places. That means a lot to families in Far North Queensland. For years they have had to send their children to Townsville, Brisbane and even, dare I say, to Adelaide to get their tertiary education. Now, with the new James Cook campus and the additional places, school leavers are able to go to the James Cook University campus in Cairns. But this is being jeopardised by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make no mistake about it, the additional places are not just numbers; they mean extra courses at James Cook. That means that there are more opportunities for people to get a local education in Far North Queensland and they do not have to travel down south. That is very important to the people in Cairns. I hope that the coalition spokespersons will come up to Cairns and try to sell this to the people of Cairns. I hope they do, because it is unsaleable. The people of Cairns know how important it is for Cairns families to have those additional 600 places. It is vital. The coalition is putting it in jeopardy. It is just sheer nonsense to suggest that this is legislation that does not hypothecate an amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the member the Sturt (Mr Pyne), said that he understood HECS. He certainly does not if he does not understand that this legislation, coupled with the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, provides a hypothecated amount to go to these extra places. I think it is very significant today when you come into the chamber to look at who is here. There are people from Adelaide in here. When you look at the statistics, you find that the participation rate for South Australia in tertiary education is higher than the national average. When you look at those statistics for Queensland as a whole, you find that they are lower than the national average.</PARA>

Then you decided that you might start charging for some graduates, so you then became the `no up-front fees for undergraduates party'. Now you are becoming the `no up-front fees for undergraduates party, but we are going to speed it up a bit, boys'. Isn't that lovely?</PARA>

For a generation injustice has been perpetrated in Queensland. For over 20 years the chances of young Queenslanders getting into tertiary education have been significantly less than they have been in any other part of the country. The perpetrator of that injustice was the former Premier of Queensland, Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen. He was the perpetrator of that injustice and it has taken this government some time to rectify that injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we finally bring in a package that gives justice to tertiary students in Queensland, what do we find?

It is raised as a tax. You can make promises about spending it, but the simple fact is that you have not included it in this legislation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the position of the government is quite clear on this matter. The Prime Minister talked about this yesterday, and the answer that he gave there is certainly pertinent to the question asked again today. The government has made it clear by its record what its position on taxation is: that is, we have not increased the level of taxation as a proportion of GDP in the period that we have been in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level today is about the same as it was back in 1982-83. Bear in mind that the ratio of tax to GDP varies according to the state of the economy. With exactly the same tax regime, you will get a different percentage to GDP depending on whether you have a growth economy or an economy going through the floor. In 1982-83 we had an economy going through the floor; we had a recession economy. The tax to GDP ratio was 24.0 per cent. In 1995-96 the estimated figure with an economy that is growing quite well&mdash;we will see figures tomorrow which I expect will bear that out&mdash;is 24.2 per cent. So in a growth economy we have virtually the same percentage of tax to GDP as we had back in 1982-83 with a recession economy. You can see, therefore, that this government has not increased the tax burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite obviously, if we had a recession at the moment the tax take would be less; company profits would be less, so company profit receipts would be less; there would be fewer people in employment, so PAYE tax receipts would be fewer; and sales would be fewer, so sales tax would be less, et cetera. But we do not have a recession economy. We have an economy that is growing well. Therefore, it is quite clear from those numbers that there has been no increase in the tax burden.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nor does the government have any intention of increasing that general percentage. We have shown after 12 years in government what our position on tax is. We are obviously not a high taxing government. We are the second lowest taxed country in the OECD. How could it possibly be said that this is a high taxing government? We have had no increase on the percentage from a recession year back in 1982-83. If anything, clearly the tax burden is less now than it was when we came into office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just a nonsense for the opposition to try to run a line about there being some secret tax agenda by this government. There is no secret tax agenda. We have, however, said that we do not want to commit ourselves to saying that there will be no change to any tax, because that is just tying yourself up with complete inflexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absurdity for a government to say that in terms of one half of its policy arm it will never make any changes at all to that side; it will only look at the other side. That is what the opposition are saying. But at the same time as they are saying that, we find that not everyone on that side thinks that way. In fact, some people on the front bench of the opposition are sitting there cogitating, and cogitating publicly, about some tax increases. For instance, the Deputy Leader of the National Party was quoted in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS> of 19 October this year. I must say that is not part of my normal reading, but it certainly makes very interesting reading. It is an article about an interview with Mr Anderson and various quotes from him. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not yet committing his party to the idea, Anderson is leaning towards the suggestion of CSIRO's Dr Wayne Mayer, who earlier this year called for a national levy on domestic food sales to provide funds for helping sustain agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Mayer, who is assistant chief of the CSIRO's Division of Water Resources . . . proposed a levy of 0.5 per cent, which on annual sales of $40 billion would raise $200 million to help fund land and water programs.</PARA>
<PARA>What we have in the mind of the Deputy Leader of the National Party, as told to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS>, is that he is sitting around there actively thinking about taxing food. When they took Fightback to the last election, at least they had the decency at the end to suggest that they would not put the GST on food. But now the Deputy Leader of the National Party is saying that is part of his thinking, and that is where he is inclined to go. How many other people are sitting there with ideas about where they are inclined to go on additional taxes? Whilst the tax spokesmen say, `Oh, there'll be no new taxes and no increases in any tax,' they are actively saying to the press, `Ah, we are thinking of introducing a tax on food.' If there are any secret tax agendas around here, we know where they are. They are not on this side.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Lilley for his question. It is a very good question. I have seen lots of specific commitments for increased spending coming from the opposition. They certainly are not consistent with making significant public savings. I have seen all those in a document which came to us the other day entitled `Speakers notes: Liberal'. This is the document. This document has some 51 pages of one-page summaries of positions of the Liberal Party on all sorts of subjects. For each one it has a background, a supposed summation of Labor's track record, the coalition alternative and then some key attack points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this document we can find lots of interesting things. Time prevents me from going through all of them, but let me venture a couple of key points. One particularly important point that I noticed related to industrial relations policy. This comes under the heading `Regional development' and it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition alternative is we will remove impediments like inflexible labour conditions and awards to growth in the regions.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for this softly, softly industrial relations policy where we will not be doing anything to take away the award structure, people will be able to decide whether they are in awards or not in awards. Here they are specifically saying that the coalition alternative is to take away impediments to growth in the regions like inflexible labour conditions and awards. That is one exceedingly interesting point. That is pretty important in itself but more important, perhaps, in the overall economic sense is the fact that this document has some 44 specific expenditure or tax cut proposals. Some of them are particularly substantial. There is the one that we knew about before, about the fixed share of revenue for the states which costs $2.8 billion. I might say that there are no costings on any of these promises in the document, but that is what the continuance of the fixed share would cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the promise to provide a tax concession for savings. That was costed in Fightback at the last election at $500 million. The promise to make private health insurance more attractive was also a Fightback promise at $850 million in the first year. Apart from these 44 promises of expenditure increases and tax cuts, there are also some implicit promises. Let me just give one fairly substantial example of that in relation to defence. Under defence it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's track record</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor has reduced defence spending as a proportion of GDP from 2.6 per cent in 1982-83 to 2.1 per cent.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Labor had met its target of funding defence at 2.6 per cent of GDP, the defence would be much better off.</PARA>
<PARA>What it is implying there is that we have been guilty of heinous behaviour in cutting defence. It follows therefore&mdash;presumably, if they are going to attack us on that&mdash;that it is their policy to increase defence expenditure and to increase it back to 2.6 per cent of GDP.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see here in this document is the real exposure of the shabbiness of this opposition&mdash;the absolute shabby performance in which you go around talking about the need for making savings. Do you remember the headland speech when the Leader of the Opposition said, `No. 1 issue on fiscal policy, we will make significant public savings'? But they never talk about any such savings. All they ever talk about is the opposite, that is, increasing expenditure and cutting taxes which, of course, blows the budget out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they are going to make substantial public savings, they would have to cover all of those before you made any net savings. Obviously, they are in for billions and billions of dollars of expenditure increases and tax cuts. To make the significant public savings would require horrendous cuts in public expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what this opposition are actually doing at the present time. At the same time as they are saying, `We need to be having more severe corrective measures on fiscal policy and making significant public savings,' they are out there every day attacking our budget in the Senate and lopping pieces off it. Just in the last few days, we have seen them change the FBT bill for the cost of compliance at a cost of an additional $40 million over the forward estimates period; block the airports sales program at a cost of $2 billion; change the HECS saving measure at a cost of $60 million; and last night&mdash;admittedly, a very small one&mdash;change the aviation fuel policy at a cost of $1 million. What we will doubtless see through the course of this week are other steps in this direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an opposition saying, `We need to make significant public savings and policy should be tighter,' but what we see from them is the exact opposite. We see from them promises to make all these additional expenditures and to cut taxes. We have seen them take action in the Senate to reduce the tightness of the budget and to reduce the budget surplus. This is an opposition that either has no idea what it is doing or it is deliberately going to go about at the next election with a secret plan of horrendous expenditure cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to see what the opposition would be like, I guess the best thing we can do&mdash;if they won't tell us about them&mdash;is go back to Fightback because that is when they had the guts to spell out their expenditure cuts. If you are going to cover all these promises and make significant public savings, that is the kind of expenditure cut program that would have to be put into place. What this document does is expose this opposition's duplicitous behaviour in trying to pretend to the Australian people that all is sweetness and light and that they would not do anything nasty. They are saying, `We will do lots of nice things. We will make significant public savings. But it will be just in running costs, so you don't have to worry about it.' But the reality is totally and starkly different.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, this must have been known to  have been incorrect because it is just such a fundamental issue in terms of the superannuation industry in this country. What we have are industry funds, which are a growing proportion of the industry. But these industry funds are not union funds. They have on their boards of trustees equal representation of employees&mdash;usually union representatives; by no means always, but often they are&mdash;and employers, and an independent chairperson. So there are no union dominated funds. They are funds which have equal representation of employers and employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is no money&mdash;not a cent&mdash;going into union coffers. The money is going into industry funds which have 50 per cent representation each of both parties and the money is invested on behalf of the members for the benefit of the members. It does not go into union coffers. That was an outrageous statement made in this Liberal Party speakers notes document which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real beneficiaries of Labor's new proposals are the unions. Union coffers will receive a generous proportion of the expected tenfold increase in superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As though it is all being funnelled into union bank accounts! That is completely and utterly outrageous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the decisions of a board of trustees have to be made by a two-thirds majority, so it is not a matter of getting the chairperson on side and overriding the other group. There has to be a two-thirds majority. So these funds operate on a consensus basis. Of course, they have representation by employers and it has not been a problem to get employers on them. Many employer groups, like the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales, the Employers Federation of New South Wales, the MTIA and other industry organisations, are represented on these industry fund boards of trustees. It is just an absurd and outrageous statement to suggest otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also says in this document that employees who are not covered by awards and the self-funded retirees receive no benefit from the budget's superannuation proposals. It is not true to say that employees who are not covered by awards do not benefit from the arrangements that I announced on budget night because the co-contribution does apply to non-award employees. If they are making contributions, they attract the co-contribution from the government, whether or not they are under awards. That is fundamental. It has been spelt out from the start. It is in the documents that we published at budget time. To suggest otherwise is just outrageous misrepresentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In both these respects we see the opposition putting forward lines for their members and candidates to put around the country which are completely and utterly wrong&mdash;total misrepresentation of the government's policy. They must know it to be so. They cannot be so stupid&mdash;maybe they can, on second thoughts, but I suspect that they are not that stupid and that it is a deliberate misrepresentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing on superannuation is an opposition which are realising that there are some political pluses in superannuation. On the superannuation guarantee, which they opposed vehemently, they now profess support. Let me just remind the House what they said about it when it was being introduced. The Leader of the Opposition said that introducing this super guarantee which requires employers to make contributions for employees would be nothing short of parliamentary confiscation of the assets of employers. The shadow finance minister said that the superannuation levy is nothing but a new tax on employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston, who was the shadow minister for superannuation&mdash;I think he is now the shadow minister for communications&mdash;said this was vicious anti-jobs legislation. The member for Flinders said that this scheme has as its twin pillars of justification the facts that it will save the government money on the budget and it will increase national savings. Neither of these arguments holds any water. He also said that the super levy is a tax on employment and that it should never be implemented. Senator Alston also said it is an ill-considered and untimely job destroyer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you can see that the whole thrust from the opposition was complete and utter opposition to the super guarantee charge. But now, being a poll driven opposition, they have seized upon it and have said, `Hang on, this thing is reasonably popular so we had better get behind it because we do not want to be seen as opposing anything that is popular.' Despite all the vehement and vicious opposition, we find that they now support the super guarantee charge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are an opposition without any principle or any real belief. They are just an opposition prepared to be totally poll driven, to get behind any position they think might be popular and, as we have seen with respect to expenditure cuts, not having the guts to propose any real expenditure cuts although their whole position requires massive cuts in that area.</PARA>

You were a member of the Fraser government which turned down exactly the same invitation that was presented to it by Attorney-General Ellicott with regard to the Sankey conspiracy activities that were being pursued against the previous Labor Prime Minister. When there was an issue as to whether there ought to be access to the documents of previous governments, you were a member of that government that turned it down on principle.

It is interesting that within a few days of the Leader of the Opposition giving his speech at the National Farmers Federation, where he said he would direct Telstra to do something, the member for Mackellar tried to snatch back the agenda for Telstra and its privatisation. The member for Mackellar has made it clear up hill and down dale that she is the one responsible for the privatisation of Telstra. Richard Alston is not allowed to talk about it, the Leader of the Opposition is not allowed to talk about it, but she is the person who is responsible for the policy detail on the privatisation of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the member for Mackellar has strong views on privatisation. The honourable member for Mackellar still remains a fervent believer in the Thatcherite view that it is wrong for the government to own anything. The honourable member for Mackellar believes that it is wrong for ministers to run these organisations and that it is wrong for ministers to own the corporations, using her unique way of describing this issue. She thinks ministers should not be directing Telstra or anyone else to do anything because they should not own them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the Leader of the Opposition is out there saying he will direct Telstra to carry out certain capital investments; he will direct Telstra which capital investments will have to be delayed so he can get the things that he wants done. Also we get the Leader of the Opposition saying that he will say how sophisticated the switches will be in the various exchanges around the country and that he will decide where they get installed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has adopted the Alston-Brezhnev centrally planned model. Last Tuesday the Leader of the Opposition had a map of Australia rolled out on his desk and he was saying which exchanges would have money spent on them and when and what sort of money would be spent on them. But on the weekend the member for Mackellar went into his office, snatched the maps off him and told him she was responsible for Telstra, not him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a crucial issue of difference between the two, and it is not just on whether or not you can direct Telstra. It goes to the question of how much money the opposition would get if it privatised Telstra. Within a day of the member for Mackellar's hitting the front page of the Saturday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, the Leader of the Opposition backgrounded Glen Milne of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, who then expressed the opposition leader's displeasure that Mrs Bishop had been trumpeting her policy achievements on Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can understand why he was displeased. The member for Mackellar was saying some pretty strange things. She was saying she thought she would get $20 billion for the sale of Telstra. It is no wonder that generated a few queries from the financial sector. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> said yesterday `Libs sell Telstra short'. There are queries about why the opposition is asking for only $20 billion for Telstra when Senator Alston is on the record as saying a few months ago that he thinks it is worth `at least $30 billion'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason they have these differences is that in the article in the Saturday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> the member for Mackellar made clear her view that foreign telephone companies, the big overseas operators, would be declared off limits and not allowed to invest in Telstra.

Warwick Smith is on the record as saying that he thinks there should not be rigid foreign investment rules, that the foreign telephone companies should be allowed to invest in Telstra. All the people who are sitting in this parliament representing rural and provincial Australia know what is going to happen if Telstra is privatised. For the life of me, I do not understand why the Leader of the National Party has agreed to the Liberal Party's proposal to privatise Telstra. The member for Warringah is the only one honest enough to say that he wants Telstra broken up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us on this side know that once you do privatise Telstra there is no way you can guarantee that the new owner will not sell off the profitable bits&mdash;the mobile telephony, the international business&mdash;and leave behind a shell that only has the rural areas, a shell that will force people in the bush to pay the real costs of their telephone calls.</PARA>

On the Medicare side, we have seen dramatic improvements over the last decade. In 1983 support for Medicare was 44 per cent, so it was sort of safe for the opposition to be attacking it. But now it is at 88 per cent. The latest survey shows that 88 per cent of Australians support Medicare in all its components. Bulkbilling is also on the increase, with 77 per cent of GPs overall bulkbilling. That compares with 45 per cent in 1984-85, the first full year of operation. That is a very successful tribute to Labor's health policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that when the current Leader of the Opposition was formerly leader he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second thing we will do is we will get rid of the bulk billing system, it is an absolute rort.</PARA>
<PARA>He said it was a monster and a nightmare. That view is still around within the Liberal Party. Earlier this year Dr Brendan Nelson, who I think will be the spokesman on health after the next election, said about bulkbilling: `I realise it's popular but it's totally unsustainable. You have to do what's right.' That is the view of the AMA as well. It is certainly something that has been supported by other members on the front bench.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to announce today a couple of innovations that will improve further public acceptance of Medicare. One of them is formless cash claiming. That has been trialled in August and September around the country. It is a new system that will be launched nationally for all users on 1 December. It basically means that, if you have paid your bill, you do not need to fill in a form. You just hand it over the counter and you will then get the refund. It means better service and shorter waiting periods for everybody. The other element is the trial of a telephone claiming service. It is a three-month national trial. It will be in all rural and remote areas of Australia, all of Northern Territory and Tasmania&mdash;which means that some 13 per cent of the population will be covered. It will be a 24-hour a day service, seven days a week. And it will mean a much quicker turnaround for country people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of all this is that we are not resting on our laurels. We do have a clear and explicit policy. We are continuing to innovate and improve our performance, and it builds on very significant achievements. But what have we seen from the opposition? We have seen a `me too' document in health, but it is full of holes. For instance, it makes The Things That Matter document, which was touted around before, actually look intellectually appealing. Your document had depth in comparison with this. One of the things that this document claims is that the private health system has passed some sort of crisis point. I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the fact that there is a record level of admissions and procedures in the private health sector&mdash;bed days, occupancy, whatever you look at. It has been growing faster than the public sector. So get your facts right.</PARA>

The point to make about this is that Telstra has lots of communications cable attached to telephone poles around the country. In my own street in downtown Noraville, Sydney Electricity installed the electricity cables on the poles, Telstra installed telephone cable on the telegraph poles, and I think it will be five or six years before Optus Vision gets to my part of the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Yes, quite right,' says the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;a small matter of credibility. Let us just have a look, for the record, in answering this criticism and suggestion, at Labor's record on defence training. First of all, one of the most obvious indicators by which we could look at this question is the number of exercises that defence personnel are involved in. It is of interest to know that in 1980-81 under those opposite&mdash;the successes of 1980-81&mdash;there were only 41 joint and combined exercises. This year, under Labor, there are 172 exercises. That means a fourfold increase. So much for some suggestion that our people are suffering on the training front.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we go to the question of quality and sophistication, something the opposition would know little about. Our training methodology is now using, both on a widespread basis and increasingly, the most up-to-date simulation technologies&mdash;new information technologies, distance learning techniques, multimedia interactive devices: all comprehensive training coming under a Labor government. If that is not good enough for opposition members to debunk this little fairytale, let's ask ourselves why they raise this when the government is about to release the most widespread changes to defence personnel conditions in the ADF's history to stop the cyclical movement of people out of the armed forces whenever the aviation industry and others decide they want to go poaching. If our people are so poorly trained, as our opponents suggest, don't tell the private sector because they obviously haven't got that message. The private sector provide evidence that you are wrong on this as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might mention in this context the fact that we have embarked on a comprehensive program of civil accreditation in our defence training and education programs. By the end of this year, nearly 500 courses in the defence forces will have received civil accreditation. If that is not good enough, let us look at how many others flock from overseas to have their military training done in this country. There are almost 20 nations from this part of the world alone, from our region alone. We also have training arrangements with the United States, New Zealand, the UK, Germany, Canada, Japan, Kuwait, the Arab Emirates and Brunei. And the list goes on. Our training is so highly regarded around the world that it is now a factor in our defence industry's ability to sell equipment overseas. If that is not enough, I invite the opposition, once more for the record, to lay down on the dispatch box how much it will spend on defence and repudiate its 1993 document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Strong Australia</EMPHASIS> which allows for a $500 million cut to defence over three years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is about the lack of credibility in the human services and health portfolio because of the lack of credibility of the person who occupies the position of minister. We saw that today in question time. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had the opportunity to repudiate and to put straight Pam Beggs's comment about the vicious and malicious campaign against Keith Wilson. She got to this dispatch box, she could have addressed the issues but she chose to slip and slide away from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She might not like to hear it, but I am going to put it on the record. I am going to repeat it again and again. You are a health minister that professes concern for mental health but when you were under pressure you tried to discredit Keith Wilson by sending your staff member around the gallery to spread rumours about his son's mental illness. Nothing could be lower. It is here in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by Paul McGeogh, and I am going to read it out to you word for word. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lawrence's staff is excusing Mr Wilson on the grounds that he was under pressure in 1992&mdash;because of his son's mental illness and because he was threatening to resign from Parliament. And the Federal Government's National Media Liaison Office is distributing material on Mr Wilson's longstanding opposition to aspects of sex education apparently as proof that he has an axe to grind with the Minister for Health.</PARA>
<PARA>I dare you to get up here and say that is not true, because the people in that press gallery know it is true. They had Brenda Conroy go around and say to them, `Keith Wilson wasn't thinking properly. His son had a mental illness. You know, really, we can't rely on what he was saying in 1992.' Then you have the hypocrisy and the cant to profess concern for mental illness when you were prepared to use a person's mental illness in their family to try to discredit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could be lower. It is part of the credibility problem. Credibility means that when you stand up here at the dispatch box you have to be taken at your word. One has to be prepared to believe that a minister of the crown is telling the truth. This is just one in a long line of events that shows that when you have a choice between telling the truth and telling a lie, the first thing that pops into your mind is a lie. I will build the case on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we had an extraordinary situation in the House where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got up and called seven Labor ministers and three staffers `the Burke squad'. You should have expected the response that received. It came today from Pam Beggs. It is very telling. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was motivated by one thing and one thing only, and that was to protect someone who was telling the truth from the malicious and vicious series of statements that were being put around. I voted for the royal commission in Cabinet. I think in those days in the Labor Party there was a lot of anxiety and some of it may have been directed at Carmen, (but) I don't see myself as an enemy of Carmen Lawrence. My motivation was nothing to do with the WA Inc. royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Beggs also denied that several Labor members displayed anger towards Dr Lawrence. She asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was Jim McGinty motivated by an act of vengeance? He supported everything that I said prior to the royal commission, in the royal commission, and so did several other ministers who were present at that Cabinet meeting on November the second.</PARA>
<PARA>You see, you have gone too far here. One of the reasons why you are in so much trouble now is that rumour campaign that was circulated about Keith Wilson. That is what prompted Pam Beggs to come out. That is what started the thing rolling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The events of yesterday were just the culmination of the Easton royal commission. The Easton royal commission found four things about you: that you were briefed by Zoltan Kovacs and Ed Russell after they had been briefed by Halden; that you were briefed by Halden yourself in the week before the tabling; that what Keith Wilson and Pam Beggs said happened on 2 November did happen; and that you raised the matter later that day yourself with Marcelle Anderson. Marcelle Anderson is the person of Notre Dame fame. I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people were not motivated by anything other than the wish to tell the truth. Remember the faces on your former staff when they had to come and give evidence against you? Remember the poor, tortured little face of Zoltan Kovacs? Remember the pain he was going through? He actually admired you, but he could not support you because that would have involved not telling the truth. That is what every one of those ministers did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard the defence that you have given several times, and to pre-empt it I am going to go through the sequence of events that happened back in 1992. What they relate to was your imprest account. The fact is that you had $5,000 of public money in your cheque account. I could be charitable. Perhaps you did not notice it. I do not know how many of my colleagues on this side of the House would not notice $5,000 in their cheque accounts. Julian might not, but I believe everyone else would notice $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened was very simple. You were caught out. Brian Burke went to gaol for it. The police had an inquiry and they said, `We had better look at all the other MP's imprest accounts'. Lo and behold, what did they find? For 18 months, earning interest, sitting in Carmen's cheque account, was $5,000 of public money. </PARA>

Normally when one makes a mistake one cops it and is prepared to say, `I am sorry, I made a mistake.' What happened on this occasion was that, in an attempt to deflect attention from yourself, you worked out a hit on Richard Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You got this petition and it was tabled on the same day that the police were releasing publicly their information that you had public money in your cheque account. You went around and had your office brief the press gallery in Perth: `Don't worry about what Carmen has done; there is something better happening about Richard Court'. Then when it was tabled the press gallery in that place was full to the brim. The next day, when the headline on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper should have been `Premier has Public Money in a Bank Account', the headline was `Both Leaders under a Cloud'. It was a deliberate strategy to deflect attention from yourself and do it by smearing an opponent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What your staff also did&mdash;I do not mind saying it here because people in the gallery know it is true&mdash;was go around behind the scenes and brief journalists that the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia was also involved in some sort of sexual impropriety. So the next day Richard Court had an inquiry into him. It took two weeks before he was cleared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would probably have got away with it&mdash;a dirty, grubby little smear, a briefing of the press gallery about something tantalising. They did not print it, just like your briefing of the press gallery on something tantalising about Keith Wilson. You would have got away with it if it were not for the fact that four days later one of the people in that petition committed suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened subsequently is telling because you would have had the opportunity to come into the House and say, `We all do things in politics that we regret. I made a mistake and I am sorry.' If that had happened, you would probably be Deputy Prime Minister of Australia today, but it did not happen. You chose the cover-up route. You chose to try to deflect attention. You went into the House and said, `I learnt of the detail of the petition and its general thrust upon its tabling.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard you say time and time again, `People's recollections differ after four years.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with that at the end of my speech. In the coming months the community will be faced with a very stark choice: the choice between a system that has been worked out and approved by the community&mdash;Medicare, a universal health system, built on the bedrock of Medibank&mdash;or a return to the confusion, chaos and inequity of the coalition's policies. What we have seen over the last 15 years is precisely that: they have never had a health policy and they are not about to acquire one under this shadow minister because he spends all his time working with the Court dirt squad digging up what he thinks are telling criticisms of the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask him: what about your policy, what are you going to do for the people of Australia in the area of health care? What are you going to do about disability services and aged care? Where is your policy? Just recently this shadow minister turned up in Melbourne at a rally about dementia specific services for the aged. It is an important issue and one that deserves decent attention. When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) addressed ACOSS in his speech on 30 October, he talked explicitly about dementia specific facilities. He claimed they were insufficiently funded and committed the opposition `to appropriate funding for dementia care'. He made it very clear to everyone there that he intended to increase the funding available for that purpose. His audience knew what he was promising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the Leader of the Opposition did. Have you just promoted yourself? The shadow minister, at the rally in Melbourne on Sunday, however, showed up his leader's words for what they were and, indeed, his character for what it is&mdash;a piece of opportunism without any substance. His speech was clearly intended to tell the audience what they wanted to hear. He openly claimed that the coalition in government would add no further funding. He said, `It will not cost a cent more.' He said they would reform the system of dementia care without an extra cent of expenditure when his leader had said, just a few weeks before, that they would increase and improve dementia specific facilities. So that is the current performance of this shadow minister&mdash;and what you could expect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition legacy should be held up for scrutiny as we move to this election. In March 1983 when we formed government it was quite clear that the health system in this country was in a shambles&mdash;and everybody knew it. It was part of the election campaign and it was taken for granted by the media and the people in this country. It is important to recognise that it is a shambles we could easily return to under a coalition government, if they were ever to be elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Fraser years, with Howard as Treasurer for part of it, the conservatives lurched through five different Medibank revisions. What happened during that time was a gradual reduction in the level of service. People were paying more and getting less; and there were more inequalities in the system. Fraser hoped he could keep the name Medibank and get away with honouring his so-called commitment at the 1975 election. But what he created was a two-tiered health system: one for the wealthy and one for the less well off. It was absolutely chaotic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They wanted to go back to the 1950s, the time when Earl Page was minister for health. At every election since then that is basically what they have done. Everyone was forced to take out private health insurance if they were able, otherwise they had to rely on a charity health system. Some two million people had no health cover at all. This was the so-called golden era of private health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every sharp operator in the private health sector could make a profit under Fraser and Howard&mdash;and the conservatives spent billions and took us nowhere. They pumped bed day subsidies into private hospitals, they made contributions for the reinsurance pool for private insurers, they made people pay a very high cost for their private insurance, and they provided tax incentives. So they were helping one section of the community while there were two million people without any insurance at all. They neglected the interests of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were over 400,000 people on middle incomes who were struggling to make ends meet and did not have any private health insurance. They were not eligible for Medibank and they did not live in Queensland. Free access to public hospitals was restricted to the disadvantaged. What happened was that the government of the day increasingly forced state governments to charge more. In fact, under Labor there had been special purpose grants to the states for hospital services. The conservatives gave it all back to the states&mdash;something I believe they intend to do again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states were no longer required to spend those funds on health, and in some cases they did not. They were allowed to introduce co-payments. Indeed, they were forced to in some cases and were told that, if they didn't, their funding would be reduced proportionately. That is part of what we have seen in the past. Mercifully, Labor's election in 1983 put an end to all that. The Fraser-Howard health debacle was finally finished. The dismantling of Medibank was reversed and we had the Medicare system that I talked about and which the opposition now say they want to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recalling, and he is not the only member to have said it, that Billy Snedden summarised the views of the conservative parties then, now and, I believe, into the future. He said, `If this health scheme goes through, this generation will be passing on a vast failure and those who vote for it will regret it. It will bedevil the future and reduce the standard of living for generations to come.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That argument has been stated not just by Mr Snedden&mdash;who was a leader a long time ago&mdash;but by every successive Leader of the Opposition and every successive shadow health spokesman since. It is not a view that the opposition have ever eschewed: they have always held the view that Medicare was a mistake, that there should be more private health insurance, that private hospitals should be given special support and that the public hospital system should essentially be a charity system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today all sections of the community have access to medical and hospital services, and pharmaceuticals on the basis of their need for the service, not their wealth or insurance status. We need to be able to use our public hospitals free of charge. We need the training of the next generation of doctors and nurses to go on there. So if you privatise and contract out to some state government, you lose that and you lose the science base, something that I am sure would happen under a conservative government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare rebates vary substantially the costs of people's medical expenses and we are able to get low cost medicines through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Medicare by all accounts is an indisputable success. So that is the credibility of the government's health care policy in human services and health. It has been measured time and time again. Its credibility is underlined by the fact that the opposition now want to say, `Me, too. We want to do the Medicare line,' although they have objected to it whenever there has been any reform. They now say, `We want to get on board.' They know that Medicare has produced one of the most effective and efficient health services in the world. At the same time, we have maintained a reasonable level of expenditure. Ours is not an expensive system in comparison with that of our OECD partners. It has been maintained at pretty much the same level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the untruths contained in that speakers' document of the Liberal Party is that we have increased the proportion of our wealth going to health care costs. It is simply not true. It has been static in the last few years and is now declining. It is now around 8 1/2 per cent of GDP. Compared with OECD countries we do stunningly well&mdash;especially compared with the United States where health eats up 14 per cent of GDP and 40 per cent of people do not have private health insurance. That is the model that this lot have favoured in the past and, I believe, would return to given half a chance. They might retain the name Medicare but all the elements underneath it would change. That was clearly indicated in Fightback and has been indicated until recently by the opposition. </PARA>

We have concentrated on improving health outcomes through prevention as well as treatment.</PARA></TALK.START>

Are you going to continue the national effort in dealing with childhood illnesses like whooping cough, meningitis, measles, mumps, and tetanus? What about the HIV-AIDS strategy which is recognised internationally as one of the best?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only policy we have heard from the opposition, speaking of immunisation programs, was in part of the first headland speech by the then newly elected Leader of the Opposition. They announced a policy that we had begun to implement two years earlier. It is quite a disgrace that the only program they could put forward was already being implemented by government. What can we expect from the coalition? While we have been rebuilding health policy from the mess they made of it last time in government, what have they been doing? Have they been building up a new set of policies and programs? Have they been developing new ideas to improve health in Australia? Not a bit of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they have been doing is working out detailed plans for dismantling Medicare. At three of the four previous elections they said they would dismantle Medicare, lock stock and barrel, with no apologies. In fact, in 1990 they did not have any policies at all: they simply went to the election and said, `It is all too hard.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and over again they have argued for the abolition of bulk-billing, limiting access to public hospitals to the disadvantaged, increasing the Medicare levy substantially, introducing compulsory fees, introducing unaffordable tax breaks for private health insurance, opting out of Medicare in favour of private health insurance, reducing the Medicare rebate, providing subsidies for health insurance in private hospitals and allowing unfettered gap insurance. These have all been elements of their policies over the last three or four elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the whole of his political career, the Leader of the Opposition has been an opponent of Medicare and of universal health care generally. Are we to believe that he has suddenly changed his mind, his basic philosophy and his attitude towards it after all that time? He is someone who has been around in Australian politics for a long time and he has spoken about health care on many occasions. He voted against Medibank in the joint sitting of parliament when he was first elected to this parliament. He opposed it again in the late 1980s as an opposition leader and in 1993 with Fightback. Not surprisingly, with their noses bloodied by that experience, the maxim now is to say less and prosper. They will not tell anyone what they are actually going to do. They just hold up a few lines like `We support Medicare' and `We support bulk-billing'. But at what level and for what services? For how long is the most important question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we to believe that John Howard has changed his mind altogether and that he has suddenly embraced Medicare, which he found so philosophically repugnant? It is very clear to me that the opposition has never supported the basic philosophy of Medicare, which is that it is a universal entitlement. It is not something you give to people when they are down and out. It is not just there for people who cannot manage the private sector. It is for everybody. Private insurance is a choice above and beyond that. It is not something you force people into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's support of Medicare is no more than cosmetic. It is a tactic that they think will help them win the election. Do you really believe, with the Leader of the Opposition's record and the expressed views of people like the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Anderson) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who are very adamantly opposed to Medicare, that they will leave Medicare alone?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will they do on these questions that I raised earlier? What will they do about bulk-billing? The Leader of the Opposition has said that he has not ruled out changes to Medicare. He did not think, in answer to some questions the other day, that the changes Fraser made amounted to massive changes to Medicare. I do not know where he was at the time. I think he was the only person in Australia who would have reached that conclusion. Maybe that is the sort of change he has not ruled out for Medicare. We got to the point where only 30 per cent of the cost of a bill was rebated. Is that the sort of change to Medicare that he is not ruling out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition says that bulk-billing will stay, but in what form will it stay? Will he introduce compulsory fees for doctors visits and force out bulk-billing by the back door by dropping the level of rebate? If you drop it too low, doctors will not accept it. Certainly you are retaining Medicare in some form, but that will destroy it. Will the coalition means test bulk-billing, as they have threatened to in the past, so that it will be just for pensioners and low income earners? Again, that destroys the universality of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will they dismantle the foundation of Medicare, for instance, by selling Medibank Private? I am pretty confident that that is on their agenda. It will increase the costs of Medicare and make it very difficult for people to have access to their rebates. Will private insurers be contracted out to run the Medibank system? Again, that is likely in the Medicare system. Will they force people out of Medicare through a combination of tax incentives and penalties? They are all the things we need to hear about from the opposition if we are to have any confidence that they have a policy. It is not enough to say that we will copy the government's policy and that we want to see Medicare retained but that we reserve the right to change it. Is it the same sort of right that Fraser retained for himself so that by the time Labor returned to government the chaos and shambles took another 10 years to repair?

There is little wonder that she has no time left to work on her area of responsibility. I intend to list a few historical events which will prove to any thinking person that the priority of the minister for health is self; it always has been that and it always will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the more recent events in her history as health minister. She authorised, and her department paid for, the publication of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> sex guide, which included a section on the joys of anal sex. Sources from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo</EMPHASIS> magazine itself at their headquarters in Adelaide tell us that 80,000 14- to 17-year-old girls would have been exposed to the joys of safe, pregnancy-free lesbian sex involving anus licking, using a latex square, fisting and using friends' sex toys. Her department subsidised the drug user's guide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Piss, powders and pleasure</EMPHASIS>. After a bit of pressure, they withdrew that one. By way of trying to explain that drug user's guide, they said that it was aimed at the Melbourne gay community. When will we see the guide `How to steal cars safely' for young juveniles? How utterly ridiculous! What a ridiculous argument. She supported workshops at the United Nations Womens Forum on the role of inflatable life-sized plastic dolls and dildos in improving health and `lesbian flirtation techniques'. This is marvellous for the battling women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the minister publicly announced that she would prorogue parliament in Western Australia specifically to end two official inquiries into the Western Australian Labor government's conduct of state affairs. She did the same in 1992 to end the Legislative Council's committee investigation into her role in the government support for the now gaoled Robyn Greenburg's Western Women. The committee tabled a letter proving that Dr Lawrence had glowingly praised Western Women. The committee reported that she had misled parliament over the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very people she was supposed to protect were lied to and robbed of their life savings; should could not remember the letter. This is the woman who was advising the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on women's issues. She has let women down comprehensively. Did she want to compensate all those women who lost their life savings through Western Women? She clearly and absolutely did not. She is a disgrace to women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, the proroguing also ended the inquiry into her role in secret deals over the loan and grants to Notre Dame University.

Where is the credibility of the health portfolio when the minister herself has no credibility?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then came the Easton petition. Dr Lawrence was aware of its tabling and that the allegations were untrue. She forgot about $5,000 sitting in her imprest account for two years. Oh to be in the glorious situation where you could forget about $5,000 sitting in your imprest account for two years. I wrote to her on 11 November 1994 asking for a response to a constituent inquiry of 25 March 1994. As any member on this side of the House would know, writing to the minister for health is like whistling Dixie. You will not get a response because she is too preoccupied with herself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing proves the coalition's total lack of fitness for office than the 15 minutes of diatribe we have heard from the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and the 10 minutes from the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron). We have here for discussion the lack of credibility in government human services and health policy. We have not heard one word from either of the coalition speakers on policy. It is clear that those opposite have no policy to debate and nothing to offer to the people of Australia. That is why they have stooped to this disgraceful personal attack for the last 25 minutes in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no sight more pitiful in politics than a man who knows he is about to lose his position desperately struggling to keep his position by engaging in vicious personal attacks on somebody else. That is what the member for Chisholm has been engaging in in the last few minutes in this House. As everybody in this chamber knows, the member for Chisholm is not going to be the minister for health, and in fact will not even be the shadow minister for health when the coalition comes back into opposition after the next election. There is nothing more certain in politics today than the fact that the member for Chisholm is on the skids. This has been a pitiful attempt by him today to cling to office by engaging in one of the most vicious personal attacks I have ever witnessed in 24 years in politics. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself for this disgraceful attack, and other coalition members should not have disgraced themselves by being here and supporting that personal attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm will never be the minister for health or the shadow minister for health in any future opposition or coalition government, because the AMA does not want him. His own leader does not want him. The health industry does not want him. He has been an abject failure. He continues to prove what an abject failure he is by the fact that three or four months before we are about to go to an election he has an opportunity in this House to talk about policies in the health and human services area and he utters not one word of policy. All he did was engage in a vicious personal attack on the minister because he has nothing to say about policy. He has nothing to offer the people of Australia as far as what he would do to help on the very issues that are important to the people of Australia in the areas of human services and health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That just demonstrates his total incapacity for any sort of position of authority on either the opposition benches or, if they were ever elected to power, the government benches. Brendan Nelson has been lined up to be the opposition spokesperson on health. The candidate for Bradfield is going to be the minister if the coalition wins government, and the member for Chisholm knows it. That is the problem he has. So in his desperate bid in the last couple of days of this parliamentary sitting, which may well be the last sitting of this parliament this term, the member for Chisholm slinks in here and engages in the most vicious, vile and dirty attack on an individual and does not even have the honesty and the credibility to notify us of the actual terms of his intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He engaged in the most vicious deception. He wrote an official letter to the Speaker saying that he wished to put up as a matter of public importance `the lack of credibility in government human services and health policy'. When we saw that we thought we were going to have a debate on human services and health policy. It is about time. We are interested to find out what the coalition has to offer. We have been asking for 13 years what the coalition would actually do. But did we actually find this out today? It is two or three days before the end of this parliamentary session and we have had no debate at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have some information about where the coalition might go. We have this little document of speakers notes from the Liberal Party, which is about what they would do. It lists a lot of platitudes, a lot of promises about all these wonderful things the coalition might do. There is no explanation about how they will do it, where the money will come from, how they will structure it, how they will increase taxes to pay for some of the promises or, if they are not going to increases taxes, what other government services they are going to eliminate to implement some of these things. For example, in the health policy area it says that they will improve the funding of health care by making private health insurance more attractive and affordable to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very interesting but what does it mean? Does it mean tax incentives? Tax incentives for whom? Is it just going to be for low income earners or for everybody? If it is tax incentives for low income earners that will cost around $500 million. If it is tax incentives for everybody to take out private health insurance, that is close to $3 billion. So where are the specifics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are they going to say? Where does this $500 million come from? Are they going to increase the health budget so that they can pay for that $500 million, or is it their intention to slash $500 million or up to $3 billion from the public hospital area? Where are the specifics? That is what I thought we were going to engage in today&mdash;a debate about human services and health policy. But of course we cannot because the opposition have no detail. They have a lot of platitudes and a lot of promises. They go around the countryside telling all sorts of distortions and making all sorts of offers to every group they can, but they never tell how they will do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in question time today that there are 44 unfunded promises in this statement. By the time we have gone through it, I think we will find that those 44 unfunded promises are going to come in at somewhere around $12 billion to $14 billion. I might be wrong; we will find out when we get the chance to do a detailed analysis. I know some of the things they have been promising around the countryside and those alone go over $10 billion. I have not looked at some of the primary industries and other things they are going to talk about. So it is at least $10 billion&mdash;maybe up to even $15 billion&mdash;worth of expenditure. Yet there is not one word of how they will fund it or what they will do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they have got 25 minutes in the House on Tuesday, with about two days left of sittings, they engage in this attack on the health minister&mdash;a vicious, vile, personal attack. They cannot talk about policy. All they can do is try to destroy someone's credibility and use the floor of parliament to introduce outrageous allegations that cannot be substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we cannot believe anything the Liberal Party has to say because we have seen their past performance&mdash;the difference between what they say they will do before they get into office and what they actually do when they get into office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was around and know what happened during the Malcolm Fraser years. I was there when Malcolm Fraser stood before the people of Australia and said, `We will retain Medibank.' He did not say, `What we will do is retain the sign "Medibank", the term "Medibank".' He did not actually retain what Medibank was about, which was universal health insurance. With five changes over the next seven years he totally destroyed Medibank. He kept the name `Medibank'&mdash;he stuck it on offices everywhere&mdash;and he made it a private health insurance fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what the opposition is likely to do. They go around today saying that they support Medicare&mdash;that they will retain Medicare and that they will retain bulk-billing. But just wait. If they get into office, within the first few months they will be saying, `Well, we have looked at things and, no, we can't afford it now. It is clear that we can't. What we thought was a good system we have analysed and have found that it is full of holes, so we are going to have to make this change and that change. We are going to have to cut back on bulk-billing.' They will do all the same things they have done every other time they have been in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might say, `That is a bit unfair. You are going back 13 years. You can't talk about that. That is in the ancient past.' Let us just look at what Liberal and National party state governments of today are doing. They lied to the people in those states by saying, `We won't do this. We will not do that.' But as soon as people like Jeff Kennett and Richard Court get into office, what do they do? They immediately go back on what they said they would do and they start slashing expenditure to hospitals and they start cutting expenditure in the whole human services and community services area. That is the performance of coalition governments across this country. That is what the people of Australia can expect from a Liberal-National party federal government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N36">Mr MARTYN EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues has completed its inquiry into the funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia. During 1988-89, the government agreed that the funding of federal courts should be changed and that separate administration be introduced. Separate administration of the Family Court commenced on 1 January 1990. Over a period of time there was a gradual process of devolution of functions from the Attorney-General's Department to the court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court has been operating in a running costs environment since 1989-90. In the last financial year, the net cost of services of the Family Court was $97.3 million, with the running cost budget in 1995-96 being approximately $67 million. The nominal Family Court running cost allocations from 1989-90 to 1994-95 have increased some 50.7 per cent, with the annual average increase being 8.5 per cent. The real percentage increase over the same period was 36.8 per cent, with an average annual real increase of 6.5 per cent. In these circumstances, the joint committee is of the view that the Family Court is adequately funded and that any changes in circumstances which may affect its workload and which may require additional funding should be negotiated with the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint committee is aware of the substantial and complex task the Family Court carries out but, like other budget funded agencies, it must manage the best way it can with the resources it has available. It is in that context that the committee was very concerned about the processes of the Family Court in running a deficit and in borrowing against future years for their present day costs. It was also concerned at the way in which unfunded proposals were approved by the court without adequate committed funds being available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that such a funding arrangement cannot be condoned and, indeed, must not continue. The committee has therefore recommended that the Auditor-General conduct an efficiency audit of the Family Court and that the court set in place appropriate cost benefit analysis strategies to ensure that this situation does not occur in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also examined the judicial structure of the court. It felt constrained to reject the proposal of the Family Court to appoint magistrates as a new judicial level and therefore completely change the basis of the Family Court's judicial structure, but it does support a process of extending the role of judicial registrars and ensuring that they be able to continue to perform the good work which they now do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also examined the management structure of the Family Court and recommends a number of changes in that area. In particular, it recommends that the regional structure should be abandoned and that individual registries should have responsibility for the operation of their own registry in the context of a national structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was particularly concerned to ensure that better use is made of existing state local court resources and that training programs be introduced for appropriate state magistrates to ensure that the family law jurisdiction is available in the suburbs and in the provincial areas of Australia. We were also very keen to support alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation, but thought these should be done on a community basis outside of the Family Court, although we recognise that some level of direct access to counselling must always remain within the Family Court itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a wide range of matters that can be considered here, but in view of the time constraints I think they would be better canvassed in the Main Committee where further discussion can take place. On that basis, I will curtail my remarks. </PARA>

The committee has been examining family law, the operation of the Family Law Act and the procedures and processes of the Family Court in Australia. That examination has taken place over the life not only of this parliament but of the previous parliament as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the report deals with the resourcing and administrative structure of the court. In short, the committee concluded that the court was sufficiently resourced but could be more efficiently conducted than it has been to date. The committee also proposed a reordering of the management structure. That reordering of the management structure would involve some far-reaching changes to the way in which the court is conducted. That proposal deserves considerable consideration by members in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on these appropriation bills. I think it is important for all of us to recognise that, while these bills outline the financial considerations of parliamentary departments and the government in general, they are also important in terms of defining the role of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us&mdash;and particularly those on this side of the House&mdash;have a very strong view as to what the role of the government should and must be within our communities. We believe in a very strong education sector. We also believe that people have an entitlement to health services. Indeed, recently in my own electorate and in other parts of Australia we have seen the government give $1 billion on drought relief to families in recognition of the hardship which they tend to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming very hard upon the heels of this drought&mdash;although some relief of the drought has been manifested in the Boonah shire and the Beaudesert shire recently, as they both received eight to 10 inches of rain&mdash;has been the terrible catastrophe which has inflicted the citizens of Beaudesert. Last Saturday evening, a fire estimated to cost $11 million destroyed seven shops and devastated the central part of the town. As well as that, it has meant that 35 people are now without work. The impact on the community has been enormous. The role which was played by the police and the fire brigade was absolutely exemplary. Emergency service workers as well moved to ensure that safety was the first major consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the council has ensured that where premises are available and suitable, there is some role for them to play. Indeed, Edwards the Retravision people in whitegoods have moved to the local showgrounds to continue their trading before Christmas. For other businesses, a butcher, a cafe, a discount store and some other shops, life is still a little bit more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We too have had our role to play in that the Department of Social Security has been very responsive in seeking to support those people who found themselves out of a job on the Monday morning due to this catastrophe. As well, the Secretary of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, Mr Derek Volker, rang some of the employers inquiring whether anything could be done to meet the needs of this town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us recognise that there is a role for local, state and federal governments to work cooperatively to meet the needs caused by devastation in this particular community. Of course, people here would realise that in a community of somewhere between 10,000 to 12,000 people, this kind of catastrophe is overwhelming. For the individuals involved, it is personally terribly tragic. All of us can only stand by and offer whatever assistance we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only blessing in all of this, importantly, is the fact that nobody was injured. However, we may be in for more sorrow. Police are conducting close investigations and are concerned that this fire was started by a person or persons unknown. For a very small and close community, it is catastrophic to realise that perhaps someone is living in their midst who has brought this harm upon the whole community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of government here has been clearly sought by the community who, as I said, have turned to all three levels of government in an attempt to pursue support for themselves&mdash;and not just private support through the whole community sector but also through the government sectors and those arms of government whose need for involvement has been terribly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not believe it is inappropriate to speak today on this terrible catastrophe and the concerns of the people in the Shire of Beaudesert, because appropriation bills are about the role of government, the kinds of things we do and do well, the kinds of things which we as a government see as important. I know that we will continue, and I certainly as the local federal member will continue, to monitor just what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government has played its role, as will the local council. But it is incumbent upon all of us to work together for this community to ensure that we are not overwhelmed by the tragedy and devastation that such a fire has caused. Of course, it will take a very long time for those business people to regain their retail trading and so on. Approaching Christmas, with the end of the drought, before the fire their economic outlook was considerably rosier and they were looking forward to a bright 1996. So it is incumbent upon all of us within government and within the community to work together to ensure that this tragedy does not overwhelm the community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Bradshaw had an almost svengali-like influence over not only his accomplice, Dave King, but Wayde Smith, now member for Wanneroo, but also others like former member and serving councillor, Rita Waters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been alleged that this particular case is a one-off case&mdash;in other words, nothing else ever happened.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who has observed and participated in the milieu of these events, I can only marvel at how easily this state of affairs has come to pass, how the Western Australian Liberal Party has allowed its affairs in its north metropolitan organisation to be dominated by people who had contributed towards what is an organised criminal operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of organised crime varies from place to place. The German police have defined organised crime as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the planned commission of criminal offences, determined by the pursuit of profit and power, which, individually or as a whole, are of considerable importance, whenever more than two persons collaborate for a prolonged or indefinite period of time, each with their own appointed tasks: by using commercial or business-like structures; by using violence or other means suitable for intimidation; or by inserting influence on politics, the media, public administration, judicial authorities or the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>At present two other outstanding matters are being investigated in relation to Wanneroo Inc.&mdash;two others that we know of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is in relation to the Belridge Medical Centre where $250,000 was received by Dr Bradshaw, at least part of which was paid over to Wayde Smith, the current serving member for Wanneroo. The other matter is the extortion of $50,000 from the Hooker Corporation to ensure approval for the Woodvale Shopping Centre by the City of Wanneroo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the modus operandi which is very similar to the modus operandi used in the case for which Dr Bradshaw and Mr King were convicted. Let us look at it quite realistically. After all, money could not be reasonably demanded for council approval of such developments without the extorting person being reasonably confident of effecting whatever approval or otherwise was required in the council. In other words, nobody in their right mind would hand over money for some sort of planning approval unless they were reasonably confident that either the thing would come to pass or, if they did not pay the money, their approval might get knocked on the head. In other words, councillors would have had to have been sufficiently under the control of whomsoever was proposing this corrupt decision to make sure it passed through council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the elements of the definition of organised crime: one, the planned commission of criminal offences. Look at the skating rink, the Pavlinovich matter. The Woodvale Shopping Centre and Belridge Medical Centre each involved the commission of criminal offences. Each involved the preliminary seeking of corrupt payments to ensure council approval of development projects. In other words, the modus operandi in each case was almost identical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element is the pursuit of power and profit. Both elements were present in each case where political influence&mdash;in other words, the ability to control the numbers in a city council&mdash;was an integral ingredient. In each case, this ability is paramount as without it none of the extortion attempts would have been in any way credible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor in this definition is individually or as a whole. In the case for which Bradshaw and King were imprisoned a concert of activity was planned, including the use of a real estate company account to launder the corrupt payments. This included Bradshaw and King and others in the direct handling of the transactions, or would have&mdash;and, of course, those who were providing political support to ensure full council support to enable the commission of the offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other is political intimidation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can tell you that that is still going on&mdash;and, essentially, in the case of the Liberal Party's organisation, the same old gang are running the show in the north metropolitan region. The Moore and Cowan divisions of the Liberal Party are dominated by fellow travellers and supporters of the gaoled ex-mayor. This gives them extensive power and influence sufficient to protect others and to give Wayne Bradshaw the confidence to carry on as though nothing had happened. This is the modus operandi of his former partner, Wayde Smith, the member for Wanneroo, as well. It also helps to preserve the influence of this group over fundraising activities in the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some examples of intimidation. Arnold Dammers is now the mayor of the city of Wanneroo, a man for whom I have the greatest of respect. He was involved in the white feather incident where he was presented with a white feather at council to try to intimidate him in a physical way at a meeting. Also Wayde Smith, at the time a serving police officer, obtained information from the records section to try to smear Arnold Dammers so that his influence would be reduced in council affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my preselection in 1991 I was accused of somehow conniving with the Labor Party supporters in the area because I sought and had the help of people like Norma Rundle and Bill Marwick&mdash;both sitting councillors for whom I still have the greatest respect for being good community operators&mdash;who had supported my campaign to get elected in 1990 as the member for Moore, to win the seat from the Labor Party. In my preselection in 1991 questions were asked by Rita Waters and Julie and Arnold&mdash;now Liberals who are fairly influential&mdash;to try to accuse me, to smear me, because of my friendship and involvement with these two people, of somehow being a fellow traveller of the Labor Party. </PARA>

That is a strange set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the next factor: influence on politics, the media, public administration, judicial authorities and the economy. The modus operandi of Mr Bradshaw on council elections was to run a stable of candidates. He would raise all the money and then dole it out bit by bit. There was the anomalous situation where he offered to raise money for one particular candidate and kept promising that he would provide how-to-vote cards. She insisted, `I do not want to have a fellow called Mick Brazier'&mdash;serving a six-year term, I think, for heroin trafficking now, who was then a Liberal Party personality in the area&mdash;`to be up in my preferences. He has got to be down the bottom.' What happened on polling day? Along came the how-to-vote cards. She was No. 1; Mick Brazier was No. 2.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the way they created new branches in the Liberal Party: the Woodvale branch, created wholly and solely by Dr Bradshaw to be able to get another branch in a preselection area; the Ocean Reef branch, created by Wayde Smith and Rita Waters and others to do the same thing; the North Shore branch, created by the Rob Johnson family; the Joondalup branch, another one to try to help Bradshaw's group out; the Edgewater branch, led by Des Wood, an old mate of Bradshaw's from years ago; and the Padbury branch. The latter two were organised by a young Liberal group in the Western Australian Liberal Party who are basically nothing better than a bunch of neo-Nazis. </PARA>

In the end Mr Cassella was convicted and sent to prison of those offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Connolly branch involved Mrs Debnam, now the selection committee chairman for the Western Australian Liberal Party. She dropped off a load of membership applications at midnight at the house of Brian Cooper&mdash;including David Cassella, who could not get into the Wanneroo branch, so they tried to slip him into the Connolly branch and they succeeded. Included in that was the secretary, Rob Johnson, now a state member in the state parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second attempt to take over the Connolly branch late last year included false addresses. An amusing incident occurred on Channel 7 news. A reporter for Channel 7 news tried to hunt one of the addresses down. We saw him standing in the narrow view, and he said, `We could not find the address, but we estimate that if it really did exist it would be right here.' He put his arms out, the camera panned back and we saw that it was in the middle of an oval. This was the address for one of a group of people who had been trying to shove into the Connolly branch and then found their way into the Edgewater branch as a consequence, including the one who lived on Woodvale oval. The Carine Glades branch was taken over&mdash;illegally, unconstitutionally&mdash;by Mrs Debnam, a fellow called Bill Stewart, who cooperated with them and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;my rival for preselection, Paul Stevenage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might conclude by recounting one particular incident which ties it all together almost like using a golden thread. In 1990 I was visited by a fellow called Greg Sharpe&mdash;at the time he was a partner in North Whitfords Estates&mdash;who mentioned in the Kyle report, the original one, the Belridge Medical Centre, which&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;was where Dr Bradshaw supposedly received $250,000. This gentleman came to see me, along with another, to try to persuade me, in the case of state seats of Whitfords and Wanneroo, that I ought not support the people&mdash;and I was not a preselection delegate but I was friends of them&mdash;who had been the candidates and narrowly lost in 1989 (that was Brian Cooper and Peter Harrop) but that I should support Wayde Smith and Rob Johnson, wonderful candidates who were going to provide great service to the state, and also Barrie McKinnon, the then leader, and his deputy, Minson, were doing a hopeless job and they should be replaced by Richard Court and Cheryl Edwardes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was about the time when there was a coalescing of the Bradshaw, Edwardes and Smith group with the Crichton-Browne people in the party. It was interesting that that particular visit came along and I was asked to give my support to what I thought was the wrong thing. I told them so and I said that I would not have a bar of it. From that point onwards, the rug was pulled from under me. In fact, this gentleman, Mr Sharpe, principal of North Whitfords Estates, then participated&mdash;and he still was right the way through to the death knock before the preselection to try to get rid of me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After this, we saw the leadership changeover. Unfortunately for Mrs Edwardes, she could not quite get there. She lost. There was a toss of a coin, because there were equal votes between her and the now deputy leader. Smith and Johnson were elected to the state parliament. As I mentioned earlier, Mr Sharpe worked overtime to get rid of me. No wonder the Premier does not want a full judicial inquiry into Wanneroo Inc. You would have to be completely surprised if he did. Wanneroo Inc. players helped him to get where he is. They are amongst his closest supporters. No wonder the Premier did not get rid of Wayde Smith, who was basically confessing left, right and centre after being sprung to telling the most blatant lies about his business relationship with Dr Bradshaw. In fact, amusingly enough, right at this very moment Dr Bradshaw is saying that he did not really have an actual business relationship&mdash;they just made it up&mdash;so that Smith would seem to have a business relationship in the area that would give him a local flavour for his candidature of the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this episode in the Liberal Party's history in Western Australia is one of the darkest and most unsavoury ones. I must say that the Liberal Party is a great institution. It is a great party. It has a great history. Unfortunately, in the case of Western Australia, its affairs have been dominated and taken over by a bunch of people who should be nowhere near public office. They are a disgrace and the sooner a proper, open judicial inquiry identifies and sets in train the prosecution of those responsible for Wanneroo Inc. the better. That will mean that the decent, honest people who provided good service to the city of Wanneroo over the years&mdash;the decent councillors who have worked for nothing, the officers of the city of Wanneroo, those people who have provided services and assistance to the city of Wanneroo&mdash;will see the disappearance of that dark cloud that hangs over the city because those responsible for what has gone on will have been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the final analysis, political life must be protected from people who see this as an opportunity to enrich themselves at the expense of others. I would say that there can't be anybody&mdash;Labor Party members, Liberals, National Party members, Democrats or whoever&mdash;who would disagree with the proposition that the Wanneroo Inc. episode is a dark period for the state of Western Australia and the sooner it is rooted out as a source of corrupt behaviour the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important issue to a lot of people. It is not simply an issue which is merely the province of local government or state government because, in many ways, the pet owners of this nation are impacted by the decisions of this parliament, as I will describe in a few moments, in relation to the wholesale sales tax on pet food and in various other ways. We as a parliament have an impact on the owners of pets and the lives of those pets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect on the sheer number of dollars that are spent in Australia. It is estimated that each year $140 million is spent on caring for dogs. People, particularly in the metropolitan area, spend a lot of money on pets&mdash;dogs in particular but cats and other pets as well&mdash;and in many instances they do so for therapeutic reasons. Domestic pet animals provide a level of companionship which has been well recognised by the medical profession and others as of critical importance to many people in our modern society who are lonely. I have run across many of my constituents who say that they would prefer to go without food themselves rather than be put in the position of seeing their animals going without. We have to recognise the importance of domestic pets in our society. I believe that that recognition ought not simply be by way of pious platitudes but that we should recognise the importance of domestic animals in a more tangible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present large amounts of money, as I have said, are spent on looking after animals. I will refer to statistics from my home state. It is estimated that $2.2 billion is spent nationally, with 60 per cent of that being spent on dogs. So you can see the size of the pet industry in this country. Just over half of the expense was for food, followed by 21 per cent for veterinary bills, 12 per cent for pet care products and eight per cent for other services such as grooming, training and boarding. These are very large amounts of money and, as such, they indicate that Australian consumers have given a very high priority to domestic pets, particularly domestic dogs, from which they gain so much pleasure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to grieve today about the fact that pet food which is specifically sold as pet food carries a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. That means that cans and bags of dried pet food are subject to a 22 per cent tax on top of the cost of production. What galls many pet owners, particularly dog owners, is that red meat sold as pet food which is processed through an abattoir that does not deal with food for human consumption carries a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. It is subject to the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. Red meat, including roo meat purchased from a kangaroo shooter, which is sold as pet food to the retailer, is subject still to the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. However, if the meat is for human consumption and is processed in an abattoir for human consumption, that meat does not carry any wholesale sales tax. So, if you go to the local butcher and you buy scraps of meat, bones or offcuts for your dog or pet, you don't pay the 22 per cent sales tax. This is, in my view, a complete anomaly that should not apply throughout the sales tax laws of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, when one takes into account the enormous amount of companionship and the value that is received by so many people, particularly older people in our community, who have pet dogs and cats, one can see that the way this tax is applied is not only anomalous but also quite pernicious in that it does apply to pet food. I think that in our humane society, one that recognises the value that our pets are to individual human beings, the therapeutic value of them and the way that they provide companionship to millions of people across our nation who would otherwise be living a much less enriched life, it would be a small concession to abolish the wholesale sales tax on pet food so that the anomaly could be got rid of and so that these people, many of whom are pensioners, would be able to better afford the food for their pets which for them are particularly vital parts of their life. My grievance is that we should look at abolishing this sales tax on pet food and that, in doing so, we should recognise the value that pets provide to so many millions of people across this nation by way of companionship. </PARA>

Although the audit office is looking at the program at present, I wonder whether we will see the results of that audit prior to the next federal election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recognising the restraints that have been placed on opposition members by the length of the speaker's list and the request of the whips to be brief, I do not intend to take advantage of my 20 minutes. However, I intend to address some comments made to the House during the adjournment debate last Wednesday by the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) when he was reflecting on the CRA dispute at Weipa and outlining some of the things that he felt most strongly about in that dispute. I wonder if I might take a paragraph or two from the member for Lilley's speech and then make observations from my perspective as a former and current&mdash;in a much smaller way&mdash;employer. The member for Lilley said these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sad thing is that it is not just CRA that wants to abolish the award system, it is also the intent of the Liberal and National parties in this House. They are content to work hand in hand with rogue companies like CRA to destroy the basis of our industrial relations system. That is precisely what Richard Court has been doing in Western Australia, what Jeff Kennett has been doing in Victoria and what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) would do nationally if he were elected to power. They are absolutely and completely hostile to the award system and genuine enterprise bargaining based on negotiation and the collective involvement of unions. They want to rip away from ordinary workers safety and security in terms of living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to take the opportunity in this debate to utterly refute those remarks made by the member for Lilley. He has totally misrepresented all that the opposition stands for on industrial relations. He has picked up the popular line, the easily sold line in the CRA dispute, of equal work for equal pay. He has implied that any effort by the coalition to free up the award system in Australia is in some way crudely exploitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been an employer&mdash;and still in a small way employing people&mdash;I am conscious of the fact that I know what I want, and one of the things I do not want is to be in any way exploitive. In common with most employers in Australia, I do not expect people to work for as little as possible. The reality is that I am more than happy to pay above the award, particularly when a job is being done not only as I wish it to be done but by an employee who shows some initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want from my employees&mdash;and I am not unique in this regard&mdash;is a higher living standard. I am very happy to pay more than the award to achieve precisely that standard. Contrary to what the member for Lilley has attested, the Liberal and National parties are not intent on destroying or abolishing the award system nor do they seek in any way, to pick up his words `to break down genuine enterprise bargaining based on negotiation and the collective involvement of unions'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand how appealing it is to run the line of equal pay for equal work and I believe that people ought to be more than adequately remunerated for what they do. But if you take an industry with which I am familiar&mdash;the fruit industry&mdash;the large majority of horticultural crops in Australia are now harvested on a contract basis. If I applied the argument of equal pay for equal work in those harvesting conditions, I would have a situation where I would say that a contractor ought not to be paid more for picking more. The simple reality is that what I would do by introducing an equal pay for equal work provision for contract fruit picking would be to deny the most productive, the most progressive, and the most contented of fruit pickers the opportunity to do what they want to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, most horticultural crops are picked on a contract basis and the pickers are remunerated on the basis of what they pick. They are the people who choose&mdash;I emphasise that&mdash;that technique for harvesting the crop because clearly their salary reflects their greater productivity. In an electorate like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that exactly the same analogy could be used in the wool industry where shearers deliberately choose to shear sheep on a contract basis. Of course it is harder work, but they choose to do it because they will be remunerated more for the work that they are doing. As a result, they feel that they have had a productive day, that they have made a contribution, and that they have been an effective member of the nation in making that contribution to the nation's total revenue base. More than that, they have not been disadvantaged in any way nor have those working alongside them been disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My party, in common with its partner the National Party, believes that people who belong to trade unions ought not to be disadvantaged and believes that freedom of association should be a characteristic of the way in which we go about structuring our industrial relations system. We believe that people should be free to belong to unions or not to belong to them as they choose. That is not implied at all in the comments made by the member for Lilley. The fact is that people in the coalition recognise the role that unions play and are happy to see their employees, if they so choose, being part of the trade union movement in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something quite ironic about the plea by members opposite in relation to the CRA dispute. The irony is that, while they have been indignant that people who went into individual bargaining would receive more remuneration, some of those same members opposite in the last decade have been guilty of promoting arrangements where unionists were to be advantaged over non-unionists, where there was to be a no ticket, no start system, and where some of the benefits won for their members were, in their words, to be denied to non-union members. I see that as exploitive. I see that as an affront. I claim that the coalition's total involvement in industrial relations reform has been to create a less exploitive Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition members and government members share a lot of things in common. We all believe in a better Australia. The majority of us are parents and therefore have children in the work force. The majority of us, therefore, have a vested interest in a work force which has in place safety rails which mean that people cannot be exploited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We share in common a detestation of exploitation. Because we have children in the work force, we want to ensure that the employers treat their employees sensibly because those employees may well be our children. I have children in the work force. I am not extraordinary in that regard. Clearly, I am most indignant if I think my children are being exploited in any way by an employer. With student children working in the hospitality industry, I am conscious of how easily that exploitation can occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see it as an affront to not only me and my party but also all coalition members for the government to suggest that we are in some way pleased to see exploitative arrangements in place and are prepared to tear down existing award structures and, as it were, send children up chimneys in a pre-Shaftesbury approach to industrial relations. The simple reality is that I am committed to ensuring that employers in Australia treat their employees well. I have no monopoly on that. That sentiment is shared by all members of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not the only statement made by the member for Lilley in that adjournment debate. He also went on to make these comments about the CRA Weipa dispute:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Behind this dispute is the central question of the right of ordinary Australians working in their jobs to collectively organise together to protect and advance their wages and conditions so they can maintain their living standards. The choice, to put it starkly, is between a take it or leave it world&mdash;`sign here or no job'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, the coalition believes that Australians have the right to collectively organise together to protect and advance their wages and conditions and that they also have the right outside of collective bargaining to organise under an enterprise bargaining system or an individual bargaining system an arrangement that best suits them, an arrangement that allows them to be flexible in their working conditions and find working conditions that suit their lifestyle or their demands and needs at a particular time. That is why in the horticultural industry contract arrangements exist&mdash;so that fruit pickers can choose to start early in the morning, to knock off in the heat of the day, to leave at a particular time to collect children from school, to have their spouse join them or leave them as suits them and be rewarded on the basis of precisely what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our industrial relations package there is no intention to deny Australians any of the advantages they currently enjoy. Those things that have been negotiated under awards stand in place under the coalition industrial relations policy. What the coalition stands for is the opportunity for Australians to enter into the sorts of employment arrangements and the sorts of working arrangements that best suit their circumstances and to do so without being treated as if they have been deliberately exploited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nation which faces unprecedented levels of unemployment, we as a parliament face the challenge of finding arrangements that best suit both employers and employees, arrangements that no longer dissuade employers from engaging people. Just prior to coming into the chamber I was involved in a telephone conversation with an employer in my area who was frustrated because he had jobs to do and he was unable to find people to do those jobs because of the sorts of constraints that were being placed on him by the existing award system. All that we have called for as a coalition in our industrial relations policy is the sort of flexibility that allows employers to take on employees without those employees being exploited and with those employees being given every opportunity to be as productive as possible and to be appropriately rewarded for that level of production. </PARA>

When I feed my cat it often comes back five minutes later with a resentful look on its face and asks for more. This is precisely the demeanour of the Deputy Prime Minister in coming to the House of Representatives with the appropriation bills asking for some hundreds of millions more when we have already granted approval for a budget this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a well fed cat. In fact, you might say it is drawing a long bow to put the adjective `feline' on the Deputy Prime Minister. One of the advantages of sitting on the back bench is that you have the opportunity to observe members on the government front bench. You observe their demeanour and their physical appearance and there is a wide variety in that. You go from the birdlike appearance of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), up one end of the front bench, to the happy demeanour of the self-styled Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Superannuation (Mr Sciacca) and his loud neckties, to the svelte sartorial appearance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). But, when my gaze rests on the Deputy Prime Minister, I am more inclined to use the adjective `bovine'. In fact, it is rarely the animal kingdom that occurs to me. I think more of sports. Perhaps sumo wrestling is a more appropriate arena in which to describe him. I am sure that is sailing a little close to the wind in parliamentary terms, but I will leave my remarks there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) we have a total of $32 million proposed in connection with the proposed development of the Fox studios at the New South Wales showground. That site, the Sydney showground as it is better known, sits on the border of my electorate of Wentworth just on the edge of Centennial Park. Despite the fact that I do not represent the residents who live immediately beside the showground, sufficient concern, grave concern indeed, about the propriety of this proposed development has arisen among the residents who I represent in this House. Therefore, I feel obliged to say a few things on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the opposition has in mind some amendments to the appropriation bill, and I will perhaps reserve some of my more detailed remarks for the consideration in detail stage. Suffice to say that a member of the state parliament of New South Wales has referred the process of this deal to the Independent Commission Against Corruption, ICAC. She has asked the commission to investigate the due process aspect of this whole deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, and I say quite bluntly on behalf of my electors who share my concern about the propriety of this deal, that the words `due process' should include an examination of what other sites there are in eastern Sydney that were examined by the company before they arrived by prime ministerial fiat, I dare to suggest, at the showground as their preferred site. In examining whether due process was followed, I believe we deserve an explanation of why they rejected those other sites in favour of the showground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are sites such as the naval stores depot at Zetland, not two par five holes away from the showground. There is the rifle range at Maroubra or Malabar, which is always a hot potato and I understand is proposed for another use, although the sporting shooters of the eastern region will  violently object to that. There are of course the Randwick barracks, which are just below the boundary of my electorate to the south. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seem to be various places in this region where the making of cinematic films could take place without any particular disturbance, but I am told by people in the company that ambient noise is a problem in some of those sites, at Zetland in particular. As part of the due process I would like this to be explained in a public fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to ask that, when due process is examined, it should include an inquiry into whether the company disclosed to the state government of New South Wales and to the federal government the scale of the entertainment element of its proposal and whether, by not disclosing it to those governments, those governments were perhaps wrongly influenced in their decision to remove the project from the normal planning processes. That is the chief concern of the electors of Wentworth. The other ones relate to the possible environmental aspects and the chances for the disruption of lives in that area. I believe they should come out in some form in the planning process, in whatever form it takes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole deal of the showgrounds is symptomatic of the Prime Minister's contempt for the views of the average citizen. I see that he is prone to dealing with only very powerful people, with the big folk, and to giving companies and semi-government authorities unfettered and unrestricted powers. This has struck me very particularly in the case of the telecommunications characters&mdash;Telstra and Optus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I picked up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning, I saw a copy of an edited speech given by John Pilger, who is an Australian, a journalist of very left-wing hue, a master of the conspiracy theory and someone with whom I could barely imagine myself having occasion to agree. But in this speech he said a few things which I believe are worthy of repetition in the House and with which I find myself in agreement. He said that a story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in September gave us an answer to the question: what will the information age bring us? He quoted the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information revolution, far from delivering media ownership diversity, is shoring up concentration of ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to cite the mergers of the Disney empire with the American ABC network and that of Times Warner with Turner Broadcasting&mdash;the purveyor of the CNN broadcast that puts so many of us to sleep with its narcotic repetition of very ordinary news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article noted a few days after that piece was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that Mr Murdoch gained control of pay TV in Australia. It may be a little premature on behalf of Mr Pilger to say exactly that, because Optus Vision has not yet reached sufficient households in Australia to provide proper competition and to determine whether or not the so-called joint venture between Foxtel and the taxpayers' company, Telstra, has really lost the battle. Mr Pilger pointed out that in this joint venture Telstra proposes to spend $3 1/2 billion of public money on a cable network for its private sector partner. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, Australians are paying 10 per cent more on their telephone bills in order to build the pay TV network for the exclusive use of Mr Murdoch.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. There is a demonstration of the deleterious consequences of the Prime Minister's tendency to deal only with the most powerful folk and to not listen to the opinions of the ordinary citizens. This often results in a sense of alienation among ordinary people. They feel alienated from government generally, from big business, from banks, certainly from trade unions, and from various government funded lobby groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite weird that a Labor government can stand validly accused in this House of favouring banks, media moguls and big business generally, while members of the Liberal Party like me have to stand here and flay their skin for doing that. We are supposed to be the party of the plutocrats and the rich. Quite clearly we are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that a political philosophy that debases the rights of individuals to exercise freedom of choice inevitably leads to this form of elitist government.

There is a case in Queensland which gives rise to the proposition that access to justice may exist in theory but does not exist in practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1989 state public servant Peter Coyne, then manager of the John Oxley Correctional Centre, became the subject of charges in respect of his conduct and management of the centre. The charges were laid by members of staff and the union industrial officer, Ms Janine Walker, who had carriage of the charges. Coyne was given a brief outline of these charges, but was continually denied access to the specific written charges. This was the first denial of justice in that he as an accused was not given the specific details of the charges against him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cooper government initiated an inquiry under retired magistrate Noel Heiner. One of the terms of reference was to inquire into and report back on the specific written complaints made against Coyne.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the inquiry had delivered its findings, the Goss government took office in December 1989. The inquiry, though legally constituted, did not give the participants immunity from prosecution. The Goss government closed the inquiry before it could be finalised. Heiner delivered documents, his notes, tapes and copies of statements in a sealed box to the government. Coyne initiated legal proceedings to obtain access to the documents. On 8 February 1990 his solicitors served notice that they sought access under regulation 65. The government was given seven days to respond. On 14-15 February, because no response had been received, Coyne instructed his solicitor to serve notice that he intended to commence court proceedings for access. On 16 February the Crown informed Coyne's solicitors that it was still considering the request of the 8th and that advice to that date was `interim'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, and to gain cabinet privilege, the documents were delivered to cabinet. On the 16th, cabinet was advised by the crown solicitor that the documents would not attract cabinet privilege and that access could not be denied. The cabinet, which included the Attorney-General and two trained solicitors, undoubtedly knew that it was dealing with material that constituted potential and foreseeable evidence. While still leaving Coyne, through his solicitors, in the belief that the documents were secure and that the Crown was still considering his request, cabinet proceeded to the secret destruction of the documents. This was achieved by advising the state archivist on 23 February that the documents were no longer pertinent or required for the public record. Cabinet sought the archivist's `urgent' approval on the same day. I ask: if they were not required, why the urgency to destroy them? Justice again, I ask?</PARA>

That, of course, includes all forms of assistance, including a right to challenge whether or not that royal commission ought to be sitting at all and whether or not all the matters that it is supposed to deliberate upon ought to be properly deliberated upon by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a royal commission in Western Australia which, by virtue of the fact that it has got away with it, has overthrown several centuries worth of Westminster tradition on cabinet confidentiality and multiple centuries worth of Westminster tradition on a member's relationship with constituents and the relationship of that in a petition. This has proceeded entirely as a result of expediency. The effect of that will now appear in the green books that we see on the table as a set of precedents which will reverberate long and loud down the corridors of power in this country and make a substantial mockery, particularly in the area of cabinet confidentiality, of our Westminster form of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cabinets do not usually amount to much in presidential systems. That is certainly the experience in the United States, where ministers operated effectively in a one to one relationship with the President and with such ice to skate on as various congress committees give them. In the Westminster system that cabinet confidentiality is everything. The capacity to provide a coherent government out of the parliamentary system is absolutely central. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a set of derisory opinions from Mr Marks. He has made an absolute mockery of this area in the propositions he put forward in which he massively expanded what was previously a very narrow and well defined legal area, an area which made it absolutely clear that cabinet confidentiality should be breached only when serious criminal matters are under consideration by a court in this country. That was expanded, in the opinion of Mr Marks, to incorporate just feeling like knowing about something. At the end of the day, that type of applied sentiment will make life very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has moved an amendment which cuts out part of the propositions that the government has put forward&mdash;that is, the amount of the fees charged by the lawyers for Dr Lawrence in their appearances before the High Court. It is an amount, from recollection, of some $243,000. The opposition has left the rest unchallenged in its amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without accepting in principle its right to move that, the government nevertheless is going to accept that amendment when Mr Prosser moves it. We will move a series of consequential amendments because, whilst Mr Prosser's amendment is clear in a schedule to the bill, to simply move that and not move the other amendments would make a mess of the rest of the bill. They all mean the same thing but there are a fairly substantial number of items that would have to be amended to incorporate the consequences of the opposition amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will accept the amendment whilst not conceding the principle that has been amply used in a challenge before a superior court. Robin Gray, at a period of time when he stood in better stead with the Liberal Party in Tasmania than he now apparently does, availed himself of this principle. He received assistance to tackle before the state Supreme Court the royal commission which was the bane of his life. Former Premier Nick Greiner received assistance to similarly attack ICAC, a permanent, ongoing royal commission, in effect, in New South Wales. He went to the Supreme Court there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no difficulty with the various Liberal governments at the time accepting those things as something that ought to be publicly funded, on the argument that substantial issues were at stake that, in those instances&mdash;in their view&mdash;went to what were matters of substance in the processes of Westminster government. Accordingly, they have supported them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recollect that we are dealing with this item now, and after we conclude these items later tonight they will go to the Senate on Wednesday and Thursday. The Senate quite clearly is having difficulty coping with the amount of legislation before it. We discover in the Senate about four different views about what approach ought to be taken in this area. The Greens' position is not determined. The Australian Democrats believe that, while all areas of the activity ought to be assisted, that ought to be done under a certain set of principles&mdash;they are very hard to quantify. The position of the opposition is as stated by Mr Prosser earlier in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to facilitate, if possible, the passage of the appropriations through the Senate by the conclusion of business probably some time on Friday this week, it is clearly important that, where we have a whole set of different views in the Senate on this matter, these views are going to have to be qualified one way or another. The propensity of the Senate is to take an infinite amount of time over such matters and to find it very difficult to arrive at a conclusion without consulting us again. We are getting to a time of the year where that is not seriously possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is the government's intention to accept the amendment by Mr Prosser. That will mean that the government will not be able to provide public assistance to Dr Lawrence in the provision of the fees outlined in the course of the legislation. A substantial precedent will be set by that process. It is a precedent that we accept only on the basis of contemporary expediency&mdash;not principle. It is a view that the government would, in the normal course of events, challenge but cannot do so in any sensible way in the time available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another second reading amendment has been circulated on the same bill. We will not be supporting that when Mr Prosser moves it. It goes to a desire to set aside the amounts of money that are going to the showground, as well as again addressing the question I have just referred to. I cannot for the life of me see why the amounts of money going to the showground, irrespective of the deliberations of ICAC, ought to be held up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funds are simply going to the reconstruction or repair of an area which, irrespective of whether or not people are cheerful about the tender processes, will have to be done anyway. They do not relate to the tender itself. They are not resources going to the successful tenderer. Those resources will still remain in the public domain. We will not be supporting the second reading amendment on Appropriation Bill (No. 4).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) said, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) provides one with an opportunity to visit one's electorate. Before I do that, I will touch on what I believe is the nub of it. We are preparing to go to the people again as the close of the 37th Parliament draws near. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he became Prime Minister in late 1991, promised the Australian people that he would deal with them honestly, that he would tell the truth and that he would not gild the lily. The government, successfully as it turned out, in 1993 ran a campaign where it promised increased employment and no increase in taxation. That was the nub of the government's successful re-election on 13 March 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had nearly three years experience of this Keating government to make our assessment. It is entirely appropriate for an opposition to look at part of the score card. I will start with taxation revenue in the reign of Paul Keating as Prime Minister. In 1992-93, $89 billion worth of taxation revenue was collected. In 1995-96, it will be $119 billion. That is a nominal percentage growth in taxation revenue over that period of 33.3 per cent. Net Commonwealth debt in 1992 was $45 billion. In 1995, it came to $97 billion. Nominal percentage growth in Commonwealth debt from 1992-95 was 130 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Total capital outlays by the Commonwealth government have gone down from a positive of nearly $4 billion in 1992-93 to a negative of $3.5 billion in 1995-96. So there were nominal percentage changes in capital outlays of minus 233 per cent. From 1987-88 to 1995-96, we have sold $8.6 billion worth of national assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise, we have had a 33 per cent increase in revenue, a 130 per cent increase in net Commonwealth debt and a 233 per cent drop in capital outlays. At the same time we have sold $8.6 billion worth of assets based on that famous claim, the l-a-w tax cut, which is due 1 January 1996 and which we know will never happen. The tax revenue increases of the excise have impacted particularly in this 37th parliament, and they impact on an electorate like mine in a most unjust way. The wholesale sales tax, the company tax, the increased tax on cars, the Medicare levy and the proposed tax on homes, which was defeated, thankfully, are all part of that revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the credible polls are telling us that there is currently a 12 per cent gap between the parties, though no-one believes that that will stay quite where it is. When the last figures were taken there was an eight per cent gap&mdash;we were eight per cent ahead while we were four per cent behind at the same time in the cycle the last time the figures were taken. The government will try anything to denigrate our credibility and to improve its own. I listened to the Lawrence debate today with total dismay. I do not have anything constructive to add but I just cannot believe that the standard of government can sink to this level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made many promises to regional Australia, but none more damaging, I believe, than its lack of delivery on youth unemployment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> On the matter of regional youth unemployment, we have got to a stage where the government has actually banned the publication of local figures. It is said that they are too volatile. It is little wonder that those figures are not allowed to be published. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at my own electorate&mdash;after all, it is 90 per cent of the state of South Australia&mdash;the regional unemployment rate in the northern and western division is 47.8 per cent. The government said it went to the people last time on jobs and not increased taxation. The sad reality is that Labor has no plan to create jobs for our children. Under Labor's policy, Australians face a future of greater uncertainty. I have read the balance sheet. Australians need to make their judgment, and I hope they will make it based on those facts and not on the glib one liners that we will have to get used to over the next three to four months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak about my electorate just briefly. The Prime Minister made a promise on 6 December 1992 that he would put a Commonwealth dollar alongside every dollar the voluntary agencies like St Vincent de Paul and the Salvation Army collected for their Christmas appeals. This promise, of course, has not been kept. In Grey there are 6,640 families&mdash;that is, 25.2 per cent of the families living there&mdash;who earn annual incomes of less than $16,000. That is the greatest number of families anywhere in the country who earn below that amount of money. Yet, we produce 50 per cent of the exports of South Australia. It is little wonder that after 25 years they have turned to a Liberal member to represent them. I repeat: 6,640 families, the most families in the whole continent, are on the lowest incomes and yet the Prime Minister tells us that he is reaching down to help us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one of those families who was earning $16,000 for most of my working life. I do not want him to reach down to help me; I want him to reach out to help me perhaps with some decent policies. He might acknowledge the effect of taxation, the effect of excise, the effect of the wholesale sales tax, and the effect of small business on the absolute inability to deliver on employment and increased employment. Let us not forget the 47 per cent of youth unemployment in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agriculture is one of our proudest industries. The Prime Minister visited Eyre Peninsula only a few months ago. After nearly 10 years of high interest rates, commodity prices, withdrawal of drought funding and IEDs, et cetera, the Prime Minister visited and offered about $1.4 million per annum over three years. Big deal! One community alone on the Eyre Peninsula will pay that in income tax in the next good year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become virtually unpopular to talk about savings in this country, yet this government is determined to constantly erode the thrift of this nation. It is quite remarkable that we have allowed ourselves to get, and I repeat, an increase in our Commonwealth debt of 130 per cent since Paul Keating became Prime Minister. At the same time he ran up that debt, he sold off some of our most valuable assets. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I want to look at the balance sheet of affairs in the electorate of Bendigo.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a later period, on 22 May, the Maryborough Knitting Mills had 130 workers sacked and the factory was virtually closed. On 8 February 1991, 177 jobs were lost in the Australian Defence Industries&mdash;a 100 per cent owned company of the government. On 15 April 1991 the Australian Defence Industries tendered for the work on the Anzac frigate worth $150 million but most of that work went to overseas companies. On 14 May 1991 Jockey Australia at Maryborough and St Arnaud closed and 90 jobs were lost. On 15 May it was decided in Benalla's favour that the Australian Defence Industries ammunition plant would be located there&mdash;Bendigo was a contender but missed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 May 1991 the Victorian state bank was referred and virtually gifted to the Commonwealth. At the time, the Victorian Premier, Joan Kirner, promised there would be no staff reductions. As we all know, there have been substantial reductions from 55,000 to an unknown number&mdash;probably losses of something in excess of 20,000. On 22 May 1991, 220 jobs were lost in Sportscraft, a factory in Bendigo. On 8 June 1991, 22 workers lost their jobs in the Bendigo Motor Co. as a result of its closure. On 24 August 1991 a Mr Helper was selected as the ALP candidate and he made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think first and foremost the major issue is employment.</PARA>
<PARA>Let's see how the balance sheet looks on employment in Bendigo. On 24 August 1991 the number of unemployed was 5,913. In October 1995 the figure was 7,278&mdash;another failure by the government. In December 1991 there were further bad unemployment figures; however, on 20 May 1992 the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) claimed that the One Nation statement would create 500 public sector jobs in Bendigo. That has not occurred and represents another failure on the balance sheet of affairs in the Bendigo electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 February 1993 the federal election was announced for 13 March. At that time there were 7,228 people on benefits for unemployment from the Department of Social Security. At that time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gave a commitment on pensions and tax. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's commitment to removing all age and service pensions from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point.</PARA>
<PARA>As we know, that promise has been defaulted on as well. Labor's record in government is pretty poor. The balance sheet is looking pretty shaky at this stage. On 26 February 1993, the Prime Minister visited my electorate and promised $42 million for Goldfields regional tourism. Of course, that promise has been broken as well. There has been zilch money for Goldfields regional tourism. </PARA>

In fact, on 1 March 1994 the then minister for sport resigned. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> One of the things that led to that resignation was the fact that she had directed all of the sporting organisations in my electorate to see Mr Helper.

On 31 March 1995, I asked the shadow minister for primary industry to come to my electorate. The shadow minister duly came. He gave a lot of support to the residents in my area who were being affected by the severe drought. He was of great assistance to them. But do you think we got any assistance from the federal government? Absolutely not. Not one cent. There was not one cent of drought relief for people in my area. Once again, when help was needed in my electorate the federal government failed.

If you had put that on, you would have completely wrecked the building industry.

<PARA>I will go back to that letter later on. I will give some history of this matter. I have spoken to Minister Cook's office in relation to this matter and I thank them for the assistance they have given so far. The history given in the letter is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.On 10th. November, 1989 our company sought an advance ruling from the Industry Research &amp; Development Board ("the Board") as to whether the proposed project would be likely to meet the definition of research and development in the Income Tax Assessment Act. In March 1990 the Tax Concession Committee ("TCC") formed the opinion that the proposed project would meet the research and development criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Based on this information we decided to proceed (note: we would not have proceeded if we had not received this advice).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In accordance with the ruling Charles I.F.E. Pty. Ltd. claimed deductions in 1989-90, 1990-91 and 1991-92 for the research and development associated with developing the system. In October 1992 the Australian Tax Office ("ATO") sought a certificate from the Board that activities were research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In August 1993 the Board assessor determined that the bulk of activities were not R&amp;D and the TCC issued a certificate to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The company sought a reconsideration of the decision by the Board and in December 1993 a second Board assessor recommended that the subject activities be accepted as satisfying the requirements for R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The TCC, however, requested that the original assessor find supporting evidence for his assessment. The original assessor did this without any consultation with us and made several important factual errors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In February 1994 the TCC, being unaware of the errors in the original assessors explanatory report, confirmed its original decision that the bulk of activities carried out the company in the development of the waste management system were not R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.This decision left our company in the unenviable position of having either to pay the tax or appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT"). I contacted the ATO to inquire our position and to my horror they presented documents on the 23rd February 1994 which indicated that we were to be charged interest and an additional tax culpability component of 50%. Apart from the financial burden this imposed a slur on our reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.We sought legal advice and appealed to the Tribunal. The hearing before the Tribunal comprising three members, one of whom we understand was a chemical engineer, took place in April and May 1995 and lasted for six days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The company called nine witnesses of whom four were independent expert witnesses with experience in the industry, three of whom had PhD's. Three were highly regarded experts which the company had originally retained to develop the system. In contrast, the Board called only the original assessor who, while having academic qualifications in the area of microbiology, was not as expert in this particular area of research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.On 11th. August 1995 the Tribunal unanimously found that the vast majority of the company's activities were research and development activities as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.After the Tribunal's decision we were very relieved and thought that after four years of having this whole business looming over us it would finally be over. We had invested an enormous amount of time and money&mdash;being both legal costs and the costs of various experts and advisers, in taking the matter to the Tribunal. However, the Board has now appealed the Tribunal's decision on the basis that the Tribunal members interpreted the law incorrectly and we now have to go to the Federal Court of Australia, therefore incurring more legal costs and the extra costs that may occur because of time delay in hearing this case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.On the 31st. October 1995 a meeting was held with ATO representatives who were co-operative but believed the matter could not be resolved until after the Federal Court Appeal has been determined (which is not expected for at least 12 months).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year's theme was tolerance, in line with 1995 being the International Year for Tolerance.

In the junior section an honourable mention was given to Nathaniel Taylor from Daylesford Primary School, with the first prize going to Alexandria Oldham, also from Daylesford Primary School. I will read those essays. Karri Golding writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tolerance is to be patient and fair to others who have different opinions or beliefs. Everybody needs to be tolerant to be part of a family, school, community or parliament. Tolerance is a two way thing. It is hard to be tolerant towards people who are not tolerant to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tolerance is important because it allows people to be different in culture, religion and politics. If there was not tolerance, everyone would be at each other and there would be verbal and physical abuse. Politicians need to be more tolerant. In parliament I often see politicians yelling abuse at each other across the house. Nobody else I know behaves like this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In extreme situations, intolerance can lead to war, family break down and conflict between religions and races. Political intolerance can lead to war assassinations and riots. Racial intolerance can cause wars and mass violence such as in South Africa and Los Angeles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everyone is different in size, weight, appearance, speech, clothing and behaviour, people are often intolerant of one or more of these things. It is important to be happy about being different and be tolerant of other people's differences. It would be boring  if we were all the same and nobody was different.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having an International Year of Tolerance will help people think more about their behaviour and lead to less wars, less violence and greater happiness in many countries.</PARA>
<PARA>Alexandria Oldham wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I am tolerant I do not like being mean and nasty. I like being nice and kind because when I am not nice and kind I am being intolerant. When a person is sitting next to me and they have a wrinkled face I do not say `Yuk I don't want to sit next to that person.' I just sit and smile at them. If someone smells badly don't tell them that you really hate them just because they smell badly. `If you can't say something nice don't say anything.' I think being tolerant is a very good thing to be. People have a right to like different things because everybody likes different things. Why is it good to be tolerant? It is good to be tolerant because we do not hurt people's feelings and we don't cause fighting throughout the world. Sometimes parents are not tolerant but I think that is because their children might deserve it. There are lots of people in the world who are not tolerant and have wars and want to kill each other. Sometimes my friends are tolerant to me and I really feel very good because they are being really nice. I have to be tolerant with things sometimes. I do not like being intolerant very much. Sometimes when I am painting or drawing I get intolerant if things are not working out. Then I have to take a break and think about it and then when I have thought about it I can keep on going.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Mr Speaker most sincerely for judging this competition again this year. There is no doubt that he chose wisely and I think that we can all learn from the comments of those very talented young people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House will be aware of serious reservations being expressed in Victoria about the Kennett government's City Link project. These reservations are centred around two primary concerns: firstly, whether the City Link proposal represents good policy in a transport sense; and, secondly, the nature of the contractual arrangements signed by the Kennett Liberal government and the contractor, Transurban. They are reservations that many people in Geelong share as they grapple with the implications of the state government's decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My major concern is that the long-term funding ramifications of the deal struck between the Kennett government and Transurban will mean the imposition of tolls on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne. I simply say to the Kennett government that that is not on. Commuters from Geelong to Melbourne will not buy it. Businesses that are reliant on travel to Geelong's largest market, Melbourne, will not buy it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say from the outset that I am not opposed to a sensible solution to Melbourne's urban transport congestion. The federal government has invested over $1 billion in Melbourne as the national transport hub. For example, we have spent $600 million on the Western Ring Road, $200 million on the airport, $150 million on the standard gauge linkage and the Dynon terminal and $200 million under the Building Better Cities program for urban transport upgrades. What we want in Victoria, as a response to Melbourne's transport needs well beyond the year 2000, is a 10 out of 10 integrated transport solution, not a four out of 10 Los Angeles style solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I raised the spectre of a toll on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne is well founded. The simple fact is that the figures on City Link do not stack up. Let me refer to the case of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, constructed at a cost of some $350 million. Motorists there are charged $1 each way for their journeys, and it is subsidised to the tune of $20 million per year for the next 20 years by the state government. Yet the Kennett government has on its books now an infrastructure project worth $1.7 billion&mdash;no subsidy from the state government and a project totally reliant on tolls to finance it as well as other concessions such as tax concessions on infrastructure bonds. So the very real concern for the Geelong community&mdash;the individuals who travel to Melbourne each day to work and the Geelong businesses which use the highway daily to transport their goods to Melbourne&mdash;is the prospect of a Kennett road toll on the Princes Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am strongly opposed to the introduction of tolls on Victorian freeways, under the arrangements that the Kennett government has struck with Transurban, for several reasons. Firstly, drivers are not being given adequate choice in the closure of the roads under the deal with Transurban, which drives motorists on to the freeway and fills the Transurban coffers. Secondly, the Kennett government is putting tolls on public roads that are already paid for. Finally, the City Link proposal delivers the awful prospect for Geelong people of tolls being put on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne and, indeed, on the Nepean Highway in the longer term as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government must give Geelong commuters and businesses a concrete assurance now that it will not allow tolls on the Princes Highway between Geelong and Melbourne. We will see enormous growth occur beyond the year 2000, up to the year 2020, in the urban corridor between Geelong and Melbourne. We need to get our planning right. We need to get the transport infrastructure right. In that Geelong-Melbourne corridor is an organisation called Habitat, which is seeking to ensure that the development which occurs in that corridor is economically sustainable over time. We want assurances from the Kennett government now that there will be no tolls imposed on the Princes Highway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The media's tolerance of the latest piece of anti-Arab sentiment, that which emanates from the pen of visiting historian David Pryce-Jones, is rather instructive given the manner in which media commentators devoured that revisionist problem child Helen Demidenko. Members would be aware that Pryce-Jones, in reference to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin said, `To shoot one's Prime Minister is what Arabs do, not what Jews do.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate on the Racial Hatred Bill I argued that well-known ramblers such as Bruce Ruxton and media commentators such as Colin Rubenstein and Norm Lipson displayed a less than sophisticated view of Arabs in their pronouncements during the Gulf War and that segments of the media were a willing party to anti-Arab hysteria. The member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) did not agree and rushed into this place to accuse me of slandering his friend Colin Rubenstein. What I had said was that the by-line which introduced Mr Rubenstein's article&mdash;namely, `Australia would be the hunting ground for Saddam Hussein's terrorists'&mdash;was anti-Arab and that it and other offerings by journalists offended Arabic people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Colin Rubenstein was not responsible for the by-line in no way mitigates the sensationalist tenor of the article. Five years later&mdash;or is it nearly six years later?&mdash;no such terrorists have emerged in Australia. Australian Arabic Council member Joe Wakim argued that the by-line stereotyped Arabs as blind followers of a dictator and addicted to violence. The member for Goldstein, however, told the House that the by-line was innocuous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, isn't it, that the member for Goldstein will tell you that Saddam Hussein is the devil incarnate and a vicious dictator but he cannot understand that the suggestion that the devil Hussein might find support within the Australian Arabic community would be offensive to many in that community? I ask the member for Goldstein: if the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> ran an article under the headline `Australia may be the target of a large force of right-wing anti-Rabin Israeli terrorists', would he be expecting the Jewish community to be outraged?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where is the member for Goldstein, or Colin Rubenstein for that matter, when David Pryce-Jones is vilifying Arabs? Let us have a look at some of the pearls of wisdom from Pryce-Jones. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one has yet managed within the Arab world to teach how to form a law-based society, in which that kind of killing gives way to a power sharing in a democratic and orderly manner.</PARA>
<PARA>It gets worse:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is pointless to pretend that the Palestinians are a law-based society. They are not, nor are any Arabs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the conclusion I draw from the murder of Yitzhak Rabin is that so strong is the Arab culture and so influential, that it may risk drawing Israelis into it in such a manner that they decide, like the Arabs, that if they wish to get rid of their leader, the way to do it is to shoot him.</PARA>
<PARA>The article is an absolute disgrace. I cannot believe that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> would run it. When the holocaust apologist David Irving applied to visit Australia his application was rejected. The opposition and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) spoke as one in their opposition to and rejection of Irving's visit. So why were the same standards not applied to this anti-Arab bloke who can vilify Arabs under the protection of the exemption clause that protects academic works? How academic was this piece of rubbish?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a challenge for the member for Goldstein. I would like him to advise the parliament whether he thinks Pryce-Jones's article is anti-Arab. Come in and tell me whether it is anti-Arab. The honourable member claims that I was too hard on Colin Rubenstein. I wonder whether he would like to come into the House and defend Pryce-Jones. It is no wonder the Arabic Council is taking this issue to the Race Discrimination Commissioner. Whether they get any justice&mdash;given that under the legislation works of this kind will be exempt from civil action&mdash;remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pryce-Jones was given three columns in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>. In response, Roland Jabbour, Chairman of the Australian Arabic Council, was given less than one column. This is the kind of hegemony practised by some newspapers&mdash;a kind of discriminatory policy. Roland Jabbour, of course, by not getting the same space to counteract this ridiculous article by Pryce-Jones, cannot counter it in a way that would be acceptable to the Arabic Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very sad that articles such as these do appear in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> and it is really sad that in this parliament not one person has stood to condemn this article.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, 16 October 1995 marked the 20th anniversary of the death of five Australian based journalists at Balibo in East Timor. They were Greg Shackleton, Tony Stewart and Gary Cunningham of HSV7 in Melbourne and Malcolm Rennie and Brian Peters, two British journalists who were working for TCN9 in Sydney. There can be no doubt that these five journalists were gunned down in cold blood by Indonesian forces who were preparing to invade East Timor. Their status as non-combatants was not respected and they were killed for the crime of having witnessed a pre-emptive strike into East Timorese territory by the Indonesian army nearly two months before the official invasion began in December 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Signals Directorate in Darwin had picked up Indonesian communications describing the incident and the murder of the journalists by the evening of that same day and a memo of the events was in the hands of government officials in Canberra that evening. It appears that the Australian government played along with an Indonesian charade&mdash;that is, that the fate of the journalists was unknown. It could be said that Australia, therefore, was an accomplice in the invasion of East Timor which occurred on 7 December 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had Australia spoken out at that time, had Australia presented its evidence of Indonesian incursions into East Timorese territory, Indonesia would in all probability have been embarrassed into backing off, because they had been repeatedly telling the world community that they had no troops in East Timor and they had no intentions of annexing the ex-Portuguese colony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty years after the violent deaths of the five journalists, there has never been a decent inquiry, a decent explanation or a protest by Australia to Indonesia. There has been no expression of regret or apology to the families of the victims. Not even their remains have been returned. I have recently come into possession of a book written by James Dunn, a highly respected former diplomat, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">East Timor: The Balibo incident in perspective</EMPHASIS>. I quote from the back of that book:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The killing of the journalists was undoubtedly the worst and the most wanton act of its kind in the history of Australian journalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concealment that took place before the journalists went to East Timor probably contributed to their deaths. And subsequent remarks that they should not have been there have tended to cast a shadow of dishonour on their motives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt as to their sincerity in seeking to bring to the Australian public the truth about a situation in which Australia's role was quite shameful. To expose such a situation is surely one of the noblest challenges before today's media, a role which highlights the media's central place in a functioning democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western response to the incident, especially that of Australia, removed any reluctance on the part of the Suharto regime to proceed with a military operation that inflicted enormous humanitarian costs.</PARA>
<PARA>On 24 October 1995, I submitted a private member's motion calling for  an official inquiry into the Balibo incident. For reasons best known to the Selection Committee of the House, I was not able to proceed with that motion this week. Apparently there was more urgent business. But I would like to read the motion into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)notes that, 20 years after the deaths of 5 Australian-based journalists, Greg Shackleton, Tony Stewart, Gary Cunningham, Malcolm Rennie and Brian Peters, in Balibo, East Timor on 16 October 1975, there has never been a satisfactory investigation into the circumstances of the killings;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)requests that the federal Government establish an inquiry into the circumstances of the deaths of those journalists, including the question of how they were killed, who was responsible, what happened to the bodies and the extent of the involvement of Australian and Indonesian authorities in suppressing details of the incident; </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)requests that the terms of reference of the inquiry include a full investigation of the role played by federal Government agencies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Defence Signals Directorate and other security and intelligence services, in relation to this matter from October 1975 onwards; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)requests that any provisions existing in any federal legislation which would otherwise prevent full disclosure to the inquiry by officers, employees, agent or subagents of federal agencies of any information under oath relevant to the terms of reference be set aside for the purposes of the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>The acclaimed Australian journalist John Pilger, who has supported my call for an inquiry, last month said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There needs to be an inquiry that will open the Defence Signals Directorate communications file for October 1975. This will undoubtedly reveal that the Australian government was aware of the truth surrounding Balibo and that successive Australian governments have sought to cover it up.</PARA>
<PARA>If what John Pilger asserts is true, and I have little doubt that it is, Australia's role in the demise of East Timor was one of downright collusion. This is a matter of grave concern, and one that warrants an answer. That is why I have called for an inquiry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And higher, yes. I must say that I paid 29 per cent last year on the station property that we had at the time. The Competition Policy Reform Bill&mdash;the so-called Hilmer reforms introduced into this House&mdash;has placed a grave shadow over all small business throughout Australia. The bill purports to abolish all licensing and franchising arrangements. There is no rationale behind the legislation unless that is going to take place. It always amuses me that people complain afterwards. You cannot be more specific than the Industry Commission report on the transport industry when it said that taxis would have the average fare reduced by $2 and it would cost taxi owners throughout this country some $3,000 million. So 50,000 small business men would be put to the sword for some remote possibility that we would save $2 on each taxi fare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only back up deregulation on what we have already deregulated in this country. We have deregulated two parts of the Australian economy. Banking is one area. I do not think anyone in this country would seriously question the absolutely disastrous nature of what followed. An amount of $16,000 million was lost in 17 firms alone. To quoting the book by Trevor Sykes, some $28,000 million was lost through people who were performing in the community and were described as the corporate cowboys of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oil industry was the other area of the economy that was deregulated. Very few people are aware of this. Some 2,000-odd service stations were wiped out, annihilated: they no longer exist. The price of petrol has dropped from $34 a barrel to $17 a barrel in the last 12 years. In the same period, the take by the oil companies has increased from around 7c a litre to some 22c a litre or, if you include another factor, some 12c a litre to 23c a litre. What has happened here is that the world price of petrol dropped clean in half and the price in Australia doubled in the same period. Deregulation has been a disastrous failure in both these areas of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hoteliers of Queensland are being placed in grave jeopardy by this legislation. The pharmacists of Queensland, newsagents, milk vendors, dairy farmers, sugar farmers, butchers and real estate agents are also being badly affected. The milk industry in Queensland has been partially deregulated. We simply got a note from our milk vendor saying, `We can't afford to deliver milk any more because there's no margin for us in the outlying areas.' While it does not worry us, five of my neighbours are on the pension and it worries them greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very good reasons why we have franchise arrangements with newsagents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions in this place I have spoken upon the plight of Tibet, and the basis of my contributions has usually been on two problems in the way that the Chinese have conducted themselves in Tibet. One is the basis of the environmental degradation that the Chinese have oversighted and the second is the way in which they have taken it upon themselves to place pressure on the Tibetan culture, on Tibetan heritage and, more importantly, on the basis of the Tibetan Buddhism religion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first item I want to briefly mention is the fact that at last the Chinese officials have acknowledged that there is nuclear waste in the Tibetan autonomous region&mdash;so-called by the Chinese officials. Last night on the adjournment, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) took some of us on this side to task in saying that we had not done enough to highlight China's continuing nuclear tests. Can I say that, in anything I have said about the French tests, I have also included my disquiet and disgust that the Chinese government continues to indulge in nuclear testing. As the leader of the Australian parliamentary observer delegation to the AIPO conference in Singapore, I made sure that, when we put on notice our concern about testing in the region, it was the two powers that we were talking about. The importance of that was that China also had an observer delegation at that conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The two major concerns about environmental degradation in Tibet have been the existence of this nuclear waste, and the belief that nuclear testing may have taken place within Tibet. As I said, the Chinese government has acknowledged that there is a nuclear waste dump in the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. They claim that this is conducted in a proper manner and that, over the 30 years of operation, there had not been `any harm to the environment'. This goes against the evidence of a number of international organisations who have reported that local doctors have seen abnormally high rates of diseases in some of the towns near this dump. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is something that the world community should ask that the Chinese government look into. As with a number of the things that are happening in Tibet, it is proper that we call upon the Chinese officials to allow independent groups to come in and to investigate what is actually happening on the ground. From time to time there has been a reluctance to allow observer groups to go and look at specific problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other thing I wish to mention tonight is the developing controversy about the appointment of the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama is the second highest ranking person within Tibetan Buddhism, below the Dalai Lama. The 10th Panchen Lama passed away in January 1989. Since then, the exhaustive processes that have a long traditional base have been undergone. In May this year, that culminated in the Dalai Lama's announcement of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, a six-year-old boy from northern Tibet, as the 11th Panchen Lama. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, the Chinese officials accepted this announcement and did not repudiate it. They have since had a change of mind. The young boy has disappeared, and the monk who was the head of the appointment body has also disappeared. There have been a number of complaints about the treatment of Tibetan monks from the monastery that deals with the education of the Panchen Lama. This is something that is a real problem. Chinese officials now are saying that they will be announcing an alternative appointment of another Panchen Lama. If this were to go ahead, it would really tear at the cultural basis of the Tibet people. It is a problem, and the greatest problem, that the Tibetans have actually confronted. There have been a number of things that they have had to put up with throughout the four decades or so since China took over. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, 29 out of every 100 young Australians want work but cannot find a job. In South Australia, the statistics for youth unemployment are even more chilling. In October, the unemployment rate amongst our 15- to 19-year-olds jumped to over 40 per cent; that is, four out of every 10 young South Australians cannot find work. For those of us working closely with the people in our electorates, it is impossible to ignore the despair which is the reality behind the statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been denied the opportunity to work, young people are struggling to maintain a sense of purpose and a sense of community. They feel betrayed&mdash;they have been betrayed&mdash;and the responsibility for this lies squarely at the feet of those who have managed our economy for the past 13 years, and that is the present Labor government. This government has no answers to the unemployment crisis which has developed under its administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the place of answers, we get constant re-affirmations from the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) that the government will meet its target of five per cent unemployment by the turn of the century. But the constancy of these re-affirmations does little to obscure their absolute absurdity. As the authors of the green paper on employment said in late 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Australia to reduce its unemployment rate to 5 per cent by the year 2000, the economy would need to grow at an average annual rate of between 4.5 per cent and five per cent</PARA>
<PARA>At present, we are growing at a rate well below four per cent and unemployment is rising steadily&mdash;from 8.2 per cent in July, to 8.3 per cent in August, then up to 8.5 per cent a month later and now 8.7 per cent. As we move further and further away from the government's target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000 and as the minister becomes more and more strident in his insistence that this target will be reached, one can only conclude, as the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 8 September concluded, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At best he is deluded, and at worst Mr Crean is not telling the truth.</PARA>
<PARA>The level of unemployment&mdash;and more particularly the level of youth unemployment&mdash;is the most urgent and the most critical of the political challenges facing this country. The government's Working Nation strategy has simply not risen to this challenge. The reason for this is clear. As a young job seeker in my electorate has observed in a letter to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem . . . is that at the end of the period when the subsidy disappears so does the job. Why does everyone ignore this fact because it is really what happens.</PARA>
<PARA>I support programs which provide training and experience to those shut out of the work force by the lack of these things, and this is what Working Nation attempts to do. But without real jobs to absorb those who complete these programs, Working Nation becomes little more than a mechanism for obscuring the true level of long-term unemployment&mdash;a mechanism for removing the long-term unemployed from the unemployment queue and returning them to it as newly unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Ensuring that there are real jobs for those who want to work will be the highest priority of a Liberal-National party government. One of the ways we will do this is by getting the government off the back of the small and medium sized businesses that will be the primary source of new jobs in the years to come. I would like to again quote from the letter I received from the young job seeker in my electorate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My parents own a small business and would really like to employ more young people and take on more apprentices but the amount of red tape to do this is very thick.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are so many little costs that add up to big costs once a person is employed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think if the pressure on small businesses was eased up maybe I would be able to find a job . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National parties are committed to removing these barriers that are currently preventing businesses from taking on new workers. We must not grow complacent about the current tragic levels of unemployment. The levels of unemployment that have plagued this country for more than a decade are not inevitable. They are the consequence of failed economic management. </PARA>

The emergence of Mujaheddin forces representing various sectional groups and the outrages performed against defenceless civilians&mdash;particularly women and children&mdash;are matters which must cause great concern in Australia and in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Afghan people need a voice which will say that this is behaviour which is of international concern.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>In his second reading speech introducing the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) said that the two new bodies to replace the Civil Aviation Authority, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA, and Airservices Australia, AA, together with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, BASI, will constitute a tripartite structure, each with separate and distinct functions but working together as parts of an integrated system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BASI has the independent role of investigating accidents and incidents&mdash;which will include any occurrences involving CASA and AA&mdash;and promoting safety by identifying deficiencies in the aviation system. This bill amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 to strengthen BASI's capacity to conduct more detailed, systemic investigations and analysis and to ensure, as far as practicable, air safety investigations in Australia conform to International Civil Aviation Organisation standards as set out in annex 13 to the Chicago convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reflect the fact that BASI operates independently within the Department of Transport the amendments vest the power to conduct investigations in the Director of Air Safety Investigation. The director has the normal powers of delegation. The amendments provide that upon completion of an investigation the secretary to the department may publish any information in an investigation report he or she considers desirable to promote aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments identify those persons&mdash;defined as `responsible persons'&mdash;who are required to report accidents, serious incidents and incidents to the director. These are essentially persons who have some involvement in the operation of an aircraft. Officers of CASA and AA who become aware of an accident, serious incident or incident are also required to report to the director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide that the purpose of an investigation is to prevent the occurrence of other accidents, serious incidents and incidents and not to assign blame or liability. This reflects the statement of the objective of an investigation in annex 13 of the Chicago convention. Many of the operative provisions of the amendments pick up definitions and standards from annex 13. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The director has the power to require persons to answer questions and produce documents, aircraft components or other things. However, the amendments provide that the answer to a question or the production of documents or aircraft components cannot be used in evidence against the person in criminal proceedings. The amendments make it clear that BASI investigators have a limited right to enter onto an accident site to secure wreckage and for the purposes of investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BASI investigators are also authorised to exercise investigation powers on private property if a magistrate issues a warrant. These powers of entry are tied to the production of formal identification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide limited protection from disclosure for those classes of records&mdash;defined as `air safety records'&mdash;that ICAO has identified as requiring protection for air safety investigation purposes. These records are not to be disclosed in civil proceedings unless a court determines that it is in the interests of justice to order disclosure having regard to the adverse domestic and international impact such action may have on that or any future investigations. This essentially mirrors the test contained in annex 13 to the Chicago convention and is consistent with the practice adopted in other jurisdictions such as Canada, the UK and the USA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that by enhancing BASI's powers of investigation these amendments will significantly assist in ensuring the integrity and safety of Australia's civil aviation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992&mdash;the SRC Act&mdash;by removing the section which establishes the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority&mdash;the authority&mdash;as a separate statutory authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the authority will no longer be a legal entity separate from the Commonwealth, it is inappropriate that money be appropriated to it. Consequently, the finance provisions of the SRC Act are also being repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority will be a separate budget-funded agency, similar to the International Air Services Commission, within the Department of Transport. As indicated in the second reading speech, since the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill was introduced in 1992, the authority has been serviced by the Department of Transport. That arrangement will continue. The amendments will have no effect on Commonwealth revenue or expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand today representing the shadow minister for aviation, Senator Parer, who has already spoken in another place on these amendments in the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995. That was on 21 September this year&mdash;just over two months ago, in fact&mdash;and that seems an extraordinarily long gap between when the Senate first had this bill presented to it and when it is being dealt with by the House of Representatives. However, Senator Parer, representing the Liberal and National parties as our shadow minister for aviation, has outlined the opposition's position in regard to these amendments and has indicated that the opposition will be supporting the two amendments that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) has outlined to us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very good reasons why the opposition would want to support those amendments moved by the government. But before I go into arguing the case as to why that is so, I would like to take a moment to speak more broadly about the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation&mdash;or BASI, as it is more commonly known in the aviation community. Over the last few years, the bureau has achieved a good reputation for itself, one which I think contrasts very starkly with the reputation that the former aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, had developed for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all of us in this chamber would recall, the Civil Aviation Authority has been the subject of great controversy over the last 2 1/2 years, commencing with the Monarch crash of June 1993 and made more controversial by the Seaview crash of October last year. The Seaview crash is in the news to this day, as the Monarch crash will be very shortly, I suspect, when the coronial inquiry into that crash is concluded and a public report and recommendations are released by the coroner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority as the safety regulator has been brought into great disrepute over the last 2 1/2 years. Despite that, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has managed to maintain its reputation. It has managed to provide a professional service to the industry and, I am sure, well-reasoned and balanced advice to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons the Civil Aviation Authority no longer exists today but has been split into two separate organisations&mdash;Airservices Australia, providing the commercial services, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, providing the safety regulation services&mdash;concerns the work of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation in the Monarch crash. BASI undertook a very extensive investigation into the causes and the circumstances surrounding that crash of June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was that report&mdash;which was released, if memory serves me right, about a year later, in the middle of last year&mdash;that inspired the Minister for Transport, Laurie Brereton, to initiate a number of changes to the legislation as well as changes, ultimately, to the way aviation is regulated in this country. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation undertook that investigation into the causes of the Monarch crash and did an excellent job. The credibility of the bureau at the time and the recommendations that it made to the government led to very substantial changes being undertaken by the Minister for Transport and the government in the way Australia operates its aviation industry. Those changes have also been supported by the opposition&mdash;which, I might add, has been calling for them for quite some time, well in advance of the government finally agreeing to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bureau has a standing second to none in the industry and it was well reflected in the Qantas submission that was made to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, more commonly known as the Morris committee. Just recently, Qantas appeared before the Morris committee with a written submission, backed up with an oral presentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the written submission the Qantas officials said that they felt very uncomfortable in dealing with the CAA, and now the CASA, as the safety regulator; indeed, they felt on certain occasions it was now necessary for them when dealing with CASA to have their own legal representatives in attendance because they did not feel they could trust it adequately. They stated that that had not been the case with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation had been an organisation with which Qantas could have a proper relationship, a partnership&mdash;if I could use that term&mdash;and one in which there had been a degree of mutual trust and respect. The Qantas submission about the differences between the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and the CASA, I think, stands the bureau in very good stead in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport has outlined the detail of the bill. My colleague who represents the opposition in this area in the Senate, Senator Parer, the shadow minister for aviation, in his presentation on 21 September this year in the Senate also outlined the details of the bill. Anybody who reads the speech given by Senator Parer or the speech given by the parliamentary secretary a few minutes ago would understand that these amendments are designed to inject some commonsense into the way in which the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation carries out its duties and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes as a surprise to many of us to realise that prior to these amendments the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation did not have the power of entry to private property to investigate an accident or an incident unless empowered to do so by the owner of the property. But that person may not be in attendance at the time of the crash; the accident could occur on a farm, with the owner of the land away and therefore unable to provide the permission on the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to do whatever possible as quickly as possible to ascertain the causes of crashes it is important that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation have the ability to enter private property to carry out an investigation of an accident to ensure that evidence can be collected as quickly as possible and a proper decision made as to the causes of the particular crash or incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is designed to simply install commonsense, to give the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation a substantial legislative base upon which it can carry out its duties and fulfil its responsibilities. Without wanting to repeat the detail of what this bill does, I can only say on behalf of the opposition that we support that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of these amendments shifts from aviation to the maritime industry, and amends the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. That is, as the parliamentary secretary has outlined, simply a commonsense approach. The Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority does not run a commercial business. It, therefore, would be inappropriate for it to provide a business plan. If it does not have a commercial business to run there really can be no way it can be required to provide an annual business plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As such, under the new regulations that will apply to government business enterprises or institutions such as the seafarers rehabilitation authority, the amendments that the government is proposing here are sensible and are designed to avoid making this authority do things that it technically cannot do. It cannot provide a business plan because it does not have a commercial function. Of course, because it does not have a commercial function, it is very difficult indeed to audit, as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the reasons the amendments are being put forward, by the government, for the seafarers rehabilitation authority. The opposition supports them. We reiterate our support for the amendments that provide a more commonsense legislative basis upon which the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation can carry out its duties and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just reiterate, in my concluding remarks, the high standing that the bureau has within the aviation community&mdash;a standing which makes it starkly different to the former CAA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995 to the House, and welcome the support for it from the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members would be aware, I have had a longstanding interest in the regulation of the aviation industry and, most particularly, in the role, functioning and accountability of the Civil Aviation Authority and the FAC. In fact, I have spoken at some length, in this Committee and in the House, on the issue, with a view to making these organisations be accountable for their actions to the parliament and truly serve the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is significant because it contains a set of reforms that were set in train when the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill was passed by this House earlier this year. That bill replaced the old Civil Aviation Authority with a newly constituted Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The new authority is directly accountable to the minister and the parliament, with responsibility for aviation safety regulations, the registration of aircraft licensing, compliance with safety regulations and safety promotion and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new organisation, Airservices Australia, was established as a government business enterprise, with responsibility for air traffic services, air navigation facilities, aeronautical information and rescue and fire fighting, and to be the industry's service provider. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation was retained, as an independent unit within the Department of Transport, with a role of examining aviation accidents and incidents. I agreed with the opposition spokesperson when he said that the BASI had an enviable reputation, in the same way as the Civil Aviation Authority had an unenviable reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms to the bodies charged with the responsibility for air safety in Australia were essential. For too long, the Civil Aviation Authority was a law unto itself. It was established in 1988. After a number of changes governments made to this organisation&mdash;it would get itself into trouble, they would reorganise it, then it would get itself into trouble again&mdash;it became a government business enterprise in 1990. From then on, there was a metamorphosis which was akin to that of Dr Jekyll into Mr Hyde. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will no doubt recall, with a sick feeling, the Monarch and Seaview disasters of 1993 and 1994. Those disasters prompted an investigation by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation of the role of the CAA.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), into the operations of the CAA, which lead to the reforms which are now taking place. I might say that I do not think that these reforms are taking place before time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those investigations uncovered deep-seated problems within the CAA. That organisation had basically been operating at the behest of the industry. It had absolutely been captured by its client group, and was more interested in their best interests than in the safety of the flying public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation into the role of the CAA stated, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The activities of the safety division appeared biased towards promoting the viability of the operator rather than on promoting safety.</PARA>
<PARA>We have seen in the newspapers this morning a report where one of the principals of one of those airlines admitted in what he said to cheating on his maintenance arrangements. If the CAA had been doing its job properly, it would have been&mdash;one would have hoped&mdash;impossible for him to cheat on the safety arrangements. He also admitted to overloading the plane. If the CAA had been doing its job properly, one would have thought that he would not have been able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken before, in both the House and this Committee, about the culture of the CAA as being one of affordable safety, of balancing the cost of safety supervision. Needless to say, such an ethos was and is totally unacceptable to the government, even though it might have been acceptable to Mr Smith, who was the chairman of the CAA at the time. I suppose that, in some ways, Mr Smith's view that you could have affordable safety might have highlighted the point that a businessman's approach to running a government business or a government authority might not necessarily be the right approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aviation safety is one of those areas in which the government has a legitimate concern and, in fact, a duty to the public to act and to regulate. There is no room here for operating under normal business concerns of value for money. Whether it is too costly for the industry to operate safely  is a question which should never be formulated, let alone acted upon, as seemed to be the case with the previous Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the government has brought these necessary reforms to the regulation of air safety, it would be very easy for us to sit back and think that it will be all right. But that is something that we will not do. We hope that these reforms will ensure that our aviation industry remains one of the safest in the world, and the government will be uncompromising in its efforts to ensure this outcome. This uncompromising approach should be taken on board by the bureaucrats who now man the government organisations associated with air safety, so that what we see here will not be just a renaming and a rechanging, as has happened with this organisation and its predecessors in the past. What the government wants is an absolute culture change which puts safety first and keeps safety there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not just sat back after the important reforms put in train by the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill earlier this year. With the bill before the House, we are providing BASI with the powers that it needs to be an effective body and to ensure that we are complying with the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. In particular, this means focusing on the prevention of accidents and air safety incidents, rather than looking to pin the blame on someone for what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This purpose is reflected in the provisions in the bill that answers to questions or production of documents to BASI cannot be used in evidence against a person in criminal proceedings. It is the purpose of this legislation to give BASI the powers to require people to answer questions and produce documents and other objects. What we want to do is ensure that the message gets out there&mdash;that the government wants compliance with the regulations and that we will give this authority the power to ensure that it gets evidence to see that compliance occurs. We want to create a culture within the industry where they see that it is actually good for their business to run a safe industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, this legislation provides protection from disclosure of certain documents, to be known as `air safety records', so that those records cannot be disclosed in civil proceedings unless a court finds that it is in the interests of justice to do so. Once again, this underlines the functions of BASI as being to investigate, not to castigate; to prevent disasters, not to prosecute after them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 to strengthen the powers of BASI. Currently, officers of BASI exercise powers as delegated to them by the secretary to the department under the air navigation regulations. These amendments will ensure that BASI has the capacity and powers to conduct detailed, systematic investigations and analysis. BASI's powers will have a firm legislative basis, allowing the bureau to play an effective role in maintaining and enhancing air safety and in ensuring that investigation of air safety conforms to the International Civil Aviation Organisation's standards, as set out in annex 13 of the Chicago convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has outlined the details of these changes, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) has mentioned many of them in his speech. The independent powers of the Director of Air Safety Investigation will have the purpose of investigation to prevent other occurrences and not to assign blame. The amendments all focus on that very thing: prevention rather than recriminations and blame, as those sorts of exercise often do not help anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these changes, the government and the opposition are keen to see resolved the issues that were of concern in this industry in the past, so that we put them behind us and start afresh. But it must be said that, in starting afresh, the government and the parliament expect that, as air fares come down because of the government's policies on competition and the government's desire to see airlines expand around Australia, more Australians will start to travel by air, and they need to have the feeling of confidence that it is safe to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very fortunate in this country&mdash;more fortunate than anywhere else&mdash;that there is probably more clear blue sky and fewer mountains and suchlike that get in the way of aeroplanes from time to time than there is in any other part of the world. We have an enviable reputation, and it has a lot to do with the topography and climate of the country, as well as with the standards set down by governments and the way the airlines adhere to these. In setting up these new organisations, the government is saying that we want the single most important focus of both the regulatory bureaucracy and the airlines themselves to be on safety. That is the No. 1 issue and the issue which they should put before all else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no profit in the industry if there is no safety in the industry, and that is why the government is setting that standard. I am confident that the reforms contained in this bill will help ensure that the safety of our skies will be preserved for all Australians and that our hard-won international reputation for safety standards will be maintained. I commend the bill to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly, without too much repetition of the issues, which have been well addressed by the previous speakers in the debate on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). The issue of air safety in Australia is quite critical, of course, as previous speakers have said, to the confidence in the industry of the travelling public. My days of air travel go back to when there was a Department of Civil Aviation. I can remember in those times the reputation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safety Digest</EMPHASIS> for very high-quality analysis of the accidents and incidents of 30 and 40 years ago. That, no doubt, laid the framework for a very positive outcome for Australia in air traffic and a very sound industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from one of the largest electorates in the country, and it relies very much on air travel. It is in my electorate's interests, therefore, that this sort of legislation be passed. I was aware of the turbulence and, to put it kindly, the general lack of confidence in certain aspects of the CAA, and one did not have to be Einstein to work out that some action was needed. Therefore, it is with some pleasure that I see this amendment bill and am able to speak on this legislation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fly almost weekly with large and small airlines and with charter operators. There is a very high standard of professionalism within that industry. I would hope that in the future when investigations are made&mdash;even a spot check of an aircraft&mdash;this standard is respected and we get a proper balance. Previous speakers have referred to the commonsense that is needed in all things. In that respect this industry is no different from any other. There have been times when some of the pilots have felt that some of the inspectors&mdash;whilst acknowledging the pilots' professionalism and sense of duty to the industry and to their passengers&mdash;were a little bureaucratic and a little petty, and could have performed their duties in a more practical way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a few points within the schedule to the bill, such as the definitions of `accident', `serious incident', `incident', `safety deficiency' and `responsible person'. These are laid down in a very clear way. Let us hope that will assist in the operation of those activities. To hear that BASI, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, did not even have the right of entry without permission is quite remarkable when you think of what they are required to do, and the general locations of particularly serious accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this bill. Although it is important that BASI be separate and independent, an integrated approach is equally important in the management of the increasing air traffic that will become more and more a feature of Australian life. It is essential that we have confidence in the safety of air travel throughout Australia. I am sure that this organisation will match that professionalism which already exists within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our airways, if not the safest, are certainly equal to the safest airways in the world. It is essential for the travelling public and the industry that we do all within our power to retain that standard. As the previous speaker said, safe airways mean a profitable industry. The community expects that this legislation will regulate the air safety industry in a way which maximises that safety. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is very important in the light of recent events that have taken place in this country over the last three years with regard to the former Civil Aviation Authority. I refer to a couple of very tragic air disasters, and the inquiries that have taken place since then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of this bill is that aviation safety in Australia be enhanced by giving CASA, Airservices Australia and BASI clearly defined roles, functions and reporting responsibilities. The coalition supports the improvement of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of concern expressed in recent times, over the last three or four years, over the ability of the couple of branches within the Civil Aviation Authority, as it was known, to deal with not only air traffic control but also the safety aspects of their brief as part of that larger GBE, the Civil Aviation Authority. As a result of a BASI inquiry into one of those serious accidents and a number of other parliamentary inquiries, the government saw fit to split the responsibilities of the former CAA into those two different bodies. Interestingly enough, I was involved in one of those inquiries, the one that was undertaken by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of this parliament into the commercialisation process and the effects that that has had as far as the Commonwealth is concerned&mdash;not just the financial effects but also in this case the effects in implementing policy and providing safety measures for the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important part of the focus of that inquiry, the report from which I think was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public business in the public interest</EMPHASIS>, was on the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation. There was some very interesting evidence taken. Whilst we were doing that inquiry, the BASI inquiry started into the Monarch crash at Young. Off the back of that, another parliamentary committee started an inquiry into the safety regulation aspect and operations of the Civil Aviation Authority. Then, while that was all going on, we had the Seaview crash, or incident, where a number of people lost their lives. All that, put together, amounted to a great deal of pressure on the government. Ultimately, what happened was that the department was split up into the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that really came out in the inquiry that we were conducting was that from time to time there was conflict of interest, as far as the CAA was concerned and as far as the minister responsible, the Minister for Transport was concerned, between the commercial imperatives and the safety imperatives. I will be the first to admit that the government has now recognised that, by establishing the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as a part of the department, the way I understand it, and Airservices Australia as the air traffic control or the commercial operation that remained as a GBE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the process of the inquiry it did occur quite clearly to us that, because of the conflict of interest, which involved the commercial imperatives of turning a profit and returning a dividend to the government as distinct from the safety factor as far as air safety control is concerned, there was an element of doubt about it. At the end of that whole inquiry we looked at a number of different models overseas. I know it was not part of the recommendations from the report that the Public Accounts Committee tabled in the parliament, but it is certainly a view that I firmly hold that we should look at dividing those responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we have a government business enterprise, a commercial entity that is operating separately but where the Commonwealth is the individual shareholder, we should separate from the commercial aspect the responsibilities for the policy formulation, implementation and oversight that control and regulate the activity of that GBE. The portfolio minister who has control of that GBE as far as the policy and the regulation is concerned should not also be the shareholding minister on behalf of the Commonwealth, because there is always going to be a conflict of interest between trying to get as much money as possible back as revenue through that department from that GBE and the regulations that it is supposed to be enforcing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I acknowledge the moves that the government made in this area. After some very tragic accidents that saw a number of Australian lives lost, we have seen the government move on the Civil Aviation Authority. A lot of the people that we were involved with and interviewed and who gave evidence before our inquiry are no longer there. I think the only high profile person who is still there is Captain Buck Brooksbank. A number of others have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the fact that the government has split those responsibilities. Air traffic control is a commercial exercise, for sure. It is very important that the activities of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority be close to the responsible minister so that he can react, change regulations, change legislation, and ensure that the air travelling public in Australia are safe. This bill is probably taking a step down the path of clarifying the specific roles and activities, as circumstances arise, of BASI and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the bill ensure that the powers of investigation have a sound legislative base. They allow BASI to play an enhanced role by clearly defining its functions and ensuring that the organisation's investigations of aviation accidents and incidents conform to international civil aviation standards&mdash;and Australia is a signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which is loosely known as the Chicago convention. Thus the amendments enhance the very important role that BASI plays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments include definitions of accidents and incidents. Accidents occur when a person on board an aircraft dies or is seriously injured. An incident is a near accident or an event that adversely affects the safety of the aircraft. People working in the industry and the staff of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia would be required to report an accident or serious incident to BASI as soon as possible. The bill also provides some sanctions if that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am most interested in the part of the bill which relates to air safety in Australia. As a previous speaker mentioned, Australia probably has one of the best records in the world for air safety. We want to keep it that way. We want to maintain the credibility of our aviation industry. We must also bear in mind&mdash;and this is often being brought to the fore and was commented on by a previous speaker&mdash;the cost to the general aviation operators. Regular transport operators also have to be prepared to toe the line as far as the regulations are concerned. They have to be prepared to adhere to the regulations that are going to ensure air transport safety in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the start of my address, the opposition supports both amendments to this particular bill. Certainly, I am very keen to see this go ahead. It is travelling, as far as I am concerned, in the right direction, following on from, as I said, the findings of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. We recommended exactly what the government eventually undertook when it separated the functions of the old CAA into the areas where they are now. This bill is enhancing the powers of those organisations, particularly the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation group. It is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing now left for the government&mdash;or, God willing, the opposition when we get into government next year&mdash;to address is that very important element in the public policy area of commercialising and ultimately privatising a lot of the government business enterprises. It is important in the process on the way through to privatisation that the responsibilities of the portfolio minister and the shareholding minister in GBEs be split so there is no conflict of interest. The portfolio minister can then maintain a very close watch on the regulations and legislation involved in controlling that particular aspect of government activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it means that at the end of the day the government makes a decision&mdash;as the current government has on many occasions in recent months&mdash;to sell a number of different government business enterprises. The legislative oversight and regulations over these bodies that are being sold off into the private sector must be in place, first and foremost as far as I am concerned, to protect the community service obligations that we are used to have flowing from the Commonwealth in this nation. I flag that area for this government and certainly for the development of public policy in this area in the future. I agree with the recommendations in this bill, particularly with regard to aviation safety in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that the coalition is supporting the amendments in the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1995 because air safety is of vital importance. As time goes by, it is going to become of increasing importance because more and more people are flying. Of course, as more and more people fly it means that there are more and more aircraft departures and landings and so the whole issue of air safety becomes more and more significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that BASI&mdash;the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation&mdash;has done such an excellent job; and nobody denies that. The references that are normally made, of course, are to the Monarch crash and the Seaview. There was also another one a little while before that with Oxley Airlines where three people lost their lives at Coffs Harbour during the airline strike. That emphasises the fact that the emphasis on air safety does not apply only to nuts and bolts; it should also apply to people. I would just like to make the point in this debate that, if we are going to have regulations to provide for air safety, there should perhaps be a stricter monitoring of what is happening with the individuals, the human beings, who are involved in flying aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA, as the shadow minister for transport, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) said, had fallen into great disrepute; there is no doubt about that. It has been split into two&mdash;Airservices Australia, which is more or less the commercial arm of it with services for air navigation and so on, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. There has been quite a deal of concern within the general aviation area, and my friend and colleague the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) mentioned that just a moment ago. But there does seem to be a feeling in the general aviation area that they are being subjected to a degree of injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe), when delivering the second reading speech, made reference to the measures being `budget funded'. Of course, they are budget funded, but the question has to be asked, `Where is the money coming from?' That is a very salient and very valid question. It would appear that the money is coming from the fuel excise levy on avgas and again it does appear that there is a degree of injustice there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the parliamentary secretary has made it quite clear, in terms of a general claim that general aviation is subsidising the regular passenger flights, that this is not the case. But there are areas where, I believe, this is the case. For instance, general aviation will be subsidising the RPT sector in some places. An example is a nine-seat Chieftain aircraft operating from Orange, New South Wales, to Sydney. A private aircraft with only the pilot on board will pay the same amount for safety regulation as a Chieftain operated by an airline such as Hazelton over the same route with eight paying passengers. This, in terms of the people involved in general aviation, is an example of how general aviation is subsidising some sectors of the RPT sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has to be made, too, that while at one stage the avgas levy did decrease, the general aviation sector had to accept a substantial reduction in services to reduce that as well. That should not be forgotten. It is interesting, too, that the CAA recorded a net profit before interest and tax of $96 million in 1993-94 and, of course, at that time it wanted to increase the levy. It is fascinating that on 1 June this year the acting chief executive officer of the CAA, Buck Brooksbank, admitted before the Senate estimates committee that 60 per cent of the proposed rise was to increase the government's return from the CAA. So 60 per cent of the increase going forward in the levy was purely to give the government some more profit at the expense, in particular, of the general aviation sector&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is totally unsatisfactory&mdash;and, indeed, a conflict of interest. But there is some good news. I am pleased to tell the Committee that, as from last night, aviation gasoline will be almost a cent cheaper because of a coalition amendment which was passed by the Senate. Aviation gasoline, or avgas, as we know it, is the fuel that is used in most propeller aircraft, and in the 1995-96 budget the government increased the duty on the fuel by 1.847c per litre to a total of 19.08c a litre. That duty also increased by an additional three per cent on 1 August as a result of the CPI indexation process. That is just one more example of the government increasing taxation by stealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the 1.847c per litre increase, 0.964c was used to increase the funding of Airservices Australia, the organisation responsible for providing airways services such as air traffic control. As we have already learnt from the CEO when he was before the Senate estimates committee in June, a great deal of that is going just to provide extra profits for the government, which is totally inappropriate. The coalition believes that funding air traffic control services through a fuel duty alone is totally inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not appropriate that fuel duties should be the only way of providing the costs of the air traffic control service. The reason is that many general aviation operators and private pilots rarely use air traffic services because they do not fly in controlled air space. It is totally unfair that they are still required to pay thousands of dollars a year in duty. For example, agricultural operators currently pay Airservices Australia an average of $7,800 per plane per year for airways services they do not use. Again, that is totally inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1.847c a litre increase in the duty applied from 1 July 1995 and I am pleased to tell the Committee that Senator Warwick Parer moved amendments in the Senate to two government bills to scale back that duty increase to 0.883c per litre. That is the same as the increase in the duty on the fuel used in jet aircraft and is needed to help fund safety regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the need for funding safety regulation, but one can only be boggled at the injustice of suggesting that propeller driven aircraft using avgas should have to pay more in fuel duty than jets. I am very pleased indeed that that has been changed. I only hope when the Senate amendment comes back later in the week, or perhaps even later today, that the House of Representatives will be sensible about it and accept that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another point which I think is of significance, particularly when we are looking at the question of increasing the cost of aviation through the increase of fuel levies. Even though we are intending to improve air safety, we want to be very certain that we do not make it so expensive to run aircraft that people are encouraged to take some short cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some contact with some aircraft maintenance people and they make the point that, from a maintenance point of view, any increase in fees for maintenance people will compromise safety in smaller aircraft operations. The cost of a proper aircraft bolt may be $10. Heaven forbid if, because of the costs involved, somebody might be forced to cut corners and get one at 10c from the local hardware store. That is a recipe for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point should be made that making the aircraft maintenance industry more expensive can only compromise safety further. Disasters such as the Monarch Airlines incident at Young and, more recently, the Seaview air disaster off the New South Wales north coast will become more common and a greater loss of life may result. Aircraft owners and operators may be more likely to fail to record all hours flown&mdash;and I hope they do not&mdash;and omit to report defects and unserviceabilities on their aircraft. This could be exacerbated if there is some attempt to increase costs on maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be full communication between aircraft engineers, pilots and owner-operators. Otherwise many faults that exist in aircraft may go unnoticed. It should be noted that, even during regular maintenance, some unserviceabilities or faults may not be found because they only appear when the aircraft is in operational mode and they are not detectable during routine maintenance. There needs to be a greater increase in communication at all levels of the aviation industry. Finally, as I said before, the coalition supports the amendments. They are in the interests of air safety and that is certainly something that we should all support. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill makes amendments to a number of Commonwealth acts as a consequence of the enactment of the Family Law Reform Act 1995. The Family Law Reform Act 1995 makes substantial changes to the Family Law Act 1975. The act provides encouragement to parents to reach agreement themselves or with the assistance of a counsellor or mediator, rather than resorting to litigation to resolve their differences. In particular, it repeals and substitutes part VII which establishes the relationships between children and their parents. The reform act as a whole seeks to change the approach taken by parents towards their children and emphasises the concept of parental responsibility for the care, welfare and development of their children, rather than the current concepts of guardianship, custody and access which are typified by notions of ownership of children. </PARA>

I am very pleased to talk in support of the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995 because I believe that this House, in its short history, has seen its fair share of flaring tempers and rising passions. Members of this parliament have always entertained very strong opinions on every subject and voiced them with great conviction&mdash;as they should.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family nurtures the individual in childhood, supports it in later life and, throughout, offers love, contact and a sense of belonging. Of course, when I say the word `family', I define the term broadly. Gone are the days when our interpretation of the word `family' consisted solely of mum, dad and however many children. It is not that this sort of family no longer exists but, in our communities today, the number of different shapes and forms families take are almost breathtaking&mdash;but still, each unit offers the same benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any bill, however remotely involved with Australian families, parents and their responsibilities to their children, deserves our thorough attention. In tampering with or developing any piece of legislation concerning the family, we are laying our hands on the fibres that hold us together and, as such, we should treat the debate with great seriousness and heavy consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I turn my attention to the consequential amendments bill before this Main Committee, I wish to begin by touching on the recent and past history concerning family law reform in this country, and then continue by discussing the importance this government places on making sure that any legislation it supports concerning the family is absolutely foolproof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 Family Law Reform Bill, passed by this House last November, represents an attempt by our present Labor government to continue the groundbreaking reform begun in 1975 when the Whitlam government passed the country's first Family Law Act. I know that in recent weeks we have once again enjoyed a thorough appraisal of the Whitlam government, from commentators of many different political persuasions, so I will not dwell at length on its achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I will say that, with the 1975 Family Law Act, Australian families and our legal fraternity had for the first time a government that was committed to changing family law, committed to improvement and committed to providing a legal framework that made the problems associated with family breakdown easier to bear. Nevertheless, despite the advances that we have made since 1975, family law has remained the extremely volatile area we always knew it to be. This is not a surprise, I believe, to any of us. It would have been unrealistic for us all to assume that we could solve these problems with one fell swoop of the legislative pen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When my colleague the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Lavarch)&mdash;the honourable member for Fisher, as he was&mdash;spoke in the House on this topic some three years ago, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are dealing with something which in a certain body of cases simply cannot be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA>And of course he is right. Unfortunately, sometimes conflict upon the breakdown of families and marriages is inevitable. The best family law system in the world&mdash;and that is what we, I believe, as a government, are endeavouring to provide&mdash;could not make this fact any different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people that blame the present Family Law Act for their pains or their frustrations will always cry foul&mdash;as can be expected. We are talking about people at one of the lowest points in their lives. Of course they are going to blame family law or the government&mdash;or anything else that makes an easy target for them, for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been thankful for the stable family environment in which I grew up, and I have been proud of the fact that my husband and I were able to provide the same stability and loving atmosphere for our children. Yet I would have to have been living in a ivory tower all of those years not to have had some experience with friends and loved ones undergoing the heartbreaking twin turmoils of divorce and the painful decisions regarding care of and contact with children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) put it quite eloquently when debating the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 in the House in November last year. Saying that he was `stunned and appalled', he asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How is it possible for a man to have sired a child and for a woman to have borne that child and then feel about each other the way they do and express sentiments of venom and hatred, often verging on violence&mdash;certainly oral violence?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are the emotions we are dealing with&mdash;irrational anger and unexplainable bitterness. Yet perhaps the most sobering thought is that the people embroiled in such torment are exactly the same as you and I&mdash;another case of `There, but for the grace of God, go I'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet it could also be unfair to say that for someone to criticise the present act simply meant that they were emotionally unstable or unhinged due to recent experiences. The present act, despite its groundbreaking character, is not perfect, even though the joint select committee's review of the Family Law Act, tabled in the parliament in late 1992, reported it was an effective tool in administering Australian family law matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the same committee made 120 separate recommendations for improvement. Committed as the government is to families in this country, we have been determined to follow that through. While it would have been easy for this government to use the excuse `People will always complain. Therefore we don't have to do anything about it,' it would have been reneging on our responsibilities to the Australian people. This Labor government has never been about taking the soft option or the easy way out. That is why we are back again now, 20 years later, to carry forward once again the same ideals of change and improvement cultivated by the Whitlam government</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a given when I say that more Australians will, unfortunately, come into contact with family law than any other legal field. Family law is one of the most constant subjects raised in my electorate office by constituents aggrieved at their circumstances and at the supposed unfairness of the system. The situation, I imagine, is the same for most of my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994 bill aimed to enshrine in the law a right to adequate and proper parenting for children, to assure their care and welfare and to help them achieve their full potential. This included the right to know and be cared for by both parents, as well as a right of contact with other people significant to their care, their welfare and development, such as grandparents and extended family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequential amendments bill is a further link in the chain of this government's plan to make sure that our children and their families get the best possible deal from the laws surrounding their relationship. This consequential amendments bill broadens the foundation laid by the 1994 Family Law Reform Bill. In particular, it concerns itself with part VII of the original bill which seeks to modify the language associated with parental responsibility concerning their children. The passing of the consequential amendments bill will carry these new definitions through to other acts where the terminology relating to the relationship between parent and child is also important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main thrusts of the 1994 bill was that it sought to rid the language describing the parent-child relationship of its negative connotations of ownership and title, and substitute it with a new sense of meaning. `Custodian' and `guardian', used by many of us when discussing criminals and imprisonment, becomes `carer.' `Access,' a word commonly used by landowners and in questions of property, was replaced in the bill by the word `contact.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The modification in language is a direct flow-on from the bill's redefinition of parental responsibility. A parent is not an owner of a child, as is suggested by the word `custodian'. A child is not the chattel of a parent. Of course, we all know that a parent does not enjoy the right to do with the child whatever he or she wants, as they would with a new car or a house, but that is how the present definitions can be interpreted as describing their relationship&mdash;especially by parents feeling betrayed by their spouses or by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an unfortunate observation to make but during family breakdowns parents sometimes treat their children as such, and it is not surprising when the language reinforces these ideas. One parent is the winner, gaining custody, and the other is the loser, with only access. Is not our terminology helping to compound the misery these parents are feeling? Where does the child's welfare stand in all of this? Over the last 20 years, it has been a continuing theme in any literature on child abuse or the child-parent relationship that the words we say to a child can determine how they feel about themselves. Children's feelings of self-worth and their perceptions of themselves develop from what they hear people&mdash;and in particular their parents&mdash;say about them If you call a child an idiot long enough, they will start to believe it. If you call a child worthless long enough, they will start to believe it. If you say to a child, `I am your custodian', with all of its negative connotations of ownership, then surely there is a chance that they will start to feel that way&mdash;owned, an object. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Language is a living, breathing thing. Just as the relationship between parent and child has changed over the last 20 years, so too does the terminology we use to explain that relationship have to change. If we are seeking to deliver a clearer definition of what it means to be a parent, surely we have to restructure its associated terms. Language, as we would all know from our experiences in this committee and in the House, is a powerful and often brutal force. Day in and day out words are flung across the chambers, and we all know that, for all of our many years of experience of political name calling, sometimes words can wound, they can elicit pain and anger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Language is powerful and no-one can doubt that. With this in mind, how can we then turn around to our children, to Australian parents, knowing what we know from our own experiences, and say to them, `Well, with regard to the language used to describe your relationship, never mind how it makes you feel; we know what it really means, don't we?' The fact is, we do not. There is too much room for a child and a parent to draw negative connotations. We have to remember that words, language, can scar. We have a duty, as the representatives of ordinary Australian men and women, to see that the language covering as potentially explosive an issue as the parent-child relationship is given as little scope as possible to be misinterpreted throughout our society, and not just in family law. Our terminology must be simple, unbiased, and anti-inflammatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already stated, the government seeks to firmly establish a new notion of parental responsibility where the care, welfare and development of a child is paramount&mdash;an obligation shared by both sets of parents with no winners and losers involved. Marriage entered into by two responsible people is an equal partnership. Their role as parents is also based on that same notion of equality. While a marriage break-up means that a partnership is dissolved, it does not mean that the parents can now abdicate their equal and continuing responsibilities to their child. The language of the law has to reflect this as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in definition and usage outlined in the 1994 bill and in the current consequential amendments bill should not be seen as some sort of exercise in politically correct window dressing. This is not about calling a bald man anything but bald. It is an attempt, supported by the Family Law Council, to rid the language used in family law of its negative and adversarial elements when it comes to parents and their children. It should not be seen as an attempt by this Labor government to undermine a parent's role in nurturing, rearing or bringing up their child. It is exactly the opposite: we hope to make the relationship better by fostering in our community a renewed respect of parenting and what it means to be a parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Critics affirm that there is no proof that changing the definition of parental responsibility and redefining the language associated with it will lead to parents becoming less adversarial in their battles over their children. Those same critics say that parents are normally possessive of their children, that they will always be so and no modification in language is going to change that. Those critics are exactly right. The feuding parents of children will often succumb to possessive emotions, bathing themselves in recrimination and hate at the unintentional expense of their child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the joint select subcommittee conducted its review of the Family Law Act, Mr Justice Joske, in a submission to that committee, criticised the changes. His Honour stated that because the words `custody' and `access' are still used in the widespread community, confusion would result about what the new terms actually meant. With all due respect to His Honour's experience and his legal knowledge, while I agree that it will not be easy changing our community's understanding of new terms such as `contact' and `carer' instead of `access' and `custodian' and that these words have become entrenched in our understanding of family law, I would suggest that with them, too, have become entrenched the negative concepts those words convey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the value for our community in introducing these new terms far outweighs any confusion that might eventuate. The benefits are too great. In fact, I believe the confusion is already prevalent when it comes to the old terms used to define parental roles in family law. I am reminded of an excellent example that my colleague the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) used during the debate over the Family Law Reform Bill when it was first introduced to this House in November last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He stated that the concept of joint guardianship is not clearly understood in the community. He went on to say that, as often happens in family law matters, one party is given custody of the child but both parents are given joint guardianship. Now, because of the win/lose connotations of the word `custody', the party who only gains joint guardianship feels like a loser. What is that worth when they do not get `custody'&mdash;`control'&mdash;of the child's welfare, education, et cetera?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However unfortunate it is for a parent to view a child as a possession, we must face the fact that a child is often seen as such when it comes to these matters. The change in terminology covered by the Family Law Reform Bill and continued by this consequential amendments bill will go some way towards alleviating these bitter feelings. As I stated before, they will not end them, but at least it will be a start. The Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995 is a start in producing a change in understanding in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not attempting to belittle the emotional torment these parents must be going through, or, indeed, their genuine desire to do what they think is best for their children, is it not right that we take steps towards reducing the hostility and the venom associated with these exchanges and reduce the opportunities for such antagonism to be expressed? It is because family breakdown evokes such basic emotions and involve such strong feelings that we need these changes. This is where the benefits of change in terminology lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequential amendments bill is all about starting to advance these benefits throughout the rest of our society, starting with a handful of important acts. Of course, the Family Law Act is not the only area where the definition of parenthood and the status of children is important. As we know and can imagine, changes of terminology concerning a relationship central to human relations is going to affect a considerable amount of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the Australian Citizenship Act 1948, the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1988, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Migration Act 1958, the Passports Act 1938 and the Social Security Act 1991. These are all pieces of legislation that are central to our community and to how our society is run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must continue the process started by the Family Law Reform Bill last year&mdash;at the very least to avoid the confusion mentioned by Mr Justice Joske. We must bring these pieces of legislation into line with the reforms proposed by the Family Law Reform Bill. When the Family Law Reform Bill is passed it would be irresponsible for us to have one piece of legislation saying one thing, and a whole lot of other acts saying another. We need to provide uniformity and, most importantly, to send a very clear message to the Australian people. Politicians have always been famous for talking about the needs of families and their desire to see families get a fair deal. Lip-service and kissing babies can only go so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deserves the support that it has received from both sides of the House. It offers families a fair deal. More, it lengthens the helping hand offered by the government to estranged families. It is a small helping hand that may assist parents in forging a new start with each other, and most particularly with their children. I do not think any of us could object to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), used a phrase `there but for the grace of God' in the context of involvement with the Family Court. I have actually been involved as a user of the system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the natural difficulties and the pain that are associated with marriage breakdown and the consequential action, my experience was that the process itself&mdash;the court, the law and associated procedures&mdash;added several layers of difficulty to what was already a difficult time. Obviously, my view is very much coloured by some of that personal experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all share the concerns that the previous speaker mentioned in terms of the desirability of successful families. But that is not always the case. The figures show that at the turn of the century approximately 40 per cent of families are going to be divorced. We are talking about a very substantial proportion of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the previous speaker on this side, the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), has already said, the coalition supports the amendments.

His report dealt with a lot more of the practical realities of the world that people find themselves in when involved with the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the 1994 bill, and both parents being involved in bringing up the child, the modification of language and all of the high-flown phrases that the parliamentary secretary has just alluded to, it seems to me that is not adequate. You can have all the language you like. You can come up with phrases that are meant to be less negative, less threatening and all the rest of it. But when people are in strife&mdash;whether they are at war with each other or not at war with each other&mdash;when they are trying to resolve the future and fate of their children, you need to deal with the individuals sensitively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem with the present system is, frankly, that that does not happen. You are dealt with as a number. The delays in the process&mdash;whether it is mediation, whether it is counselling, whether it is formal legal action&mdash;go on interminably.

It seems to me that, unless we address those on the ground issues of how we deal with people, all the rest of it, frankly, is of little consequence. I think that is where a lot of this legislation falls down. I do not dispute the good intent, but what I am saying is that it is not practical in real terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comment was made about Judge Joske. I actually had some first-hand experience with Judge Joske and I would have to say he was undoubtedly one of the shining lights in the family law process, in my experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to go through the details of the bill. As the parliamentary secretary said, we are aiming to amend, as a consequence of previous legislation, a number of other acts. Of course, we have also seen the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 reviewed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, and it raised a number of concerns. It talked about its concerns about inequality of bargaining power; it talked about the need to look at alternative action in terms of conciliation, mediation or court proceedings; it talked about the problem of immunity of mediators and the need to have some standards if you are going to give immunity; and it talked about perhaps having some variations or exemptions in terms of the rights of the children and their best interests. I think those are all very practical, legitimate concerns. Although the government in its response has come back and said, `We accept these,' I have not seen any actual action from the government in dealing with those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I have a number of concerns. I think those concerns start with the Chief Justice of the Family Court. It seems to me he is far too keen to jump into publicity and get into empire building. I recently heard him talking about wanting to extend his activities into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander activities and so on and so forth. It seems to me that his job should be to make sure that the empire that he has already got is running effectively, and that is not happening at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about children and their rights, very briefly. The point that it seems to me we have come to in this country is that we are giving children rights and representation at a time often well before they are of a maturity to understand and to deal in those situations. In a divorce case, a 12-year-old or a 13-year-old might well have separate representation, but it seems to me they have no ability to tell the separate representative in any meaningful way what to do. I have known cases where the separate representation has just not been carried through, where the representative has changed from one month to the next month, where there was one brief meeting and the child did not even know what he was being asked to make a decision about as to which parent he wanted to live with, and things of that sort. The system is fundamentally not administered with a consideration for the people who are being affected by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency, as we all know, is an absolute disaster. That is another area that the government could pay a lot of attention to. The quality of the counselling is something that needs to be given a lot more practical attention to. Lawyers do not know what to advise clients. They say, `It depends which judge you draw in the morning as to which way it is going to go.' How the hell can you deal with a situation like that? If it depends on the luck of which judge you get, how can a lawyer give you quality advice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I am really concerned about with the legislation is where you get an imbalance in the power of the partners. That seems to me the biggest flaw in the whole system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst obviously the government and the opposition both support this legislation, I have to flag that I have some concerns. Words will not change the reality. I think there is much more of a need for a practical approach to implementing legislation in this whole area, and, whilst I support the bill, I have to say that I do so with great trepidation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very grateful for my audience arriving, without which this speech would be dispensable. This afternoon we are considering, I think, two very important bills. One of the principles behind them is that we should get away from talking in family breakdown situations about custody and access. I totally and wholeheartedly approve of that&mdash;after all, it is eons since we started, in this country, treating women as property or as being owned by their husbands. The terms `custody' and `access' unfortunately do treat children as though they are a prized possession. In lieu of that, we talk about residency and contact. I would urge all members of this parliament to embrace this change of terminology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that is part and parcel of the bill is the parenting plans. I do not want to equivocate about this but I have to say that, even though I totally support the concept of parenting plans, they are unlikely to make one iota of difference in terms of trying to resolve bitter disputes that often erupt at the end of relationships and marriages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These parenting plans are going to benefit people who really do not need to benefit from parenting plans. Having said that, I am unequivocally in support of them. This is real progress and, again, I would urge all members of this House to fully support it. I should have mentioned that this basically arose through the work of the joint committee that was chaired by Jim McKiernan. I would like to pay tribute to Senator McKiernan and his committee in the previous parliament, because they were the icebreakers in family law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's first report was very important, and a lot of the amendments in these bills reflect the recommendations of the good work of that committee. I am also pleased to confess modestly that, as chairman in this parliament, I was able to bring down a report on the Child Support Agency. It is a matter of regret to me that the government has picked up only 53 of the 163 recommendations and is still considering the toughest 110. I wish it well in its deliberations. That report will stand the test of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to apologise, when I speak on this bill, to many hundreds of ordinary Australians because, during the course of that inquiry, as chairman, I suggested that I and the committee were fully aware of the real difficulty that exists in terms of what we call now residency and access. I suggested that the committee would be taking up the problem in its other inquiry into funding and administration of the Family Court of Australia. Frankly, we have failed to do that. I do have a genuine sense of letting a lot of people down. Those problems will not go away and they are not going to be rectified by the change of terminology&mdash;as welcome as that change is&mdash;or by proposing parenting plans&mdash;as welcome as that innovation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware that I drew the ire of the Chief Justice of the Family Court for a speech I made on 1 May 1995. I suppose I will always say about myself in this House that I am a radical, and the standard definition of a `radical' is someone who is prepared to fight for their beliefs. I guess you will understand better than most that, coming from the western suburbs of Sydney, I would rejoice in the proposition that I am a radical. I thought the speech I made was eminently reasonable because I pointed out that there were a lot of difficulties with the Family Court and the family law area. I had the temerity to suggest that it was not working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to regurgitate that speech, but I pointed out that we were spending over $100 million per year of government money to the Family Court in the terminal stages of relationships and marriages: that is, when they were dead and over, we would spend the money, but not up-front. This did not make good sense to me, and I raised issues of access and equity. I suggested that legal rights which you are financially incapable of exercising are not rights at all. Go around and talk to people who are embroiled in family law matters and ask them about the absolutely extraordinary amounts of money that they are paying. We cannot even afford to fund cases of merit for women and their children who are financially eligible. Legal aid is running out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised access and equity issues. I also had the temerity to say that the Family Court locks people into a formalistic litigation pathway. That is the truth of the matter. I suggested that we needed to make a fresh start in family law.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am prepared to call an extraordinary meeting of the Committee earlier at the convenience of the Chief Justice if he wishes to interrupt his six week trip. Otherwise the Committee will hear the Chief Justice on his return.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore the accusation that the committee or I am unwilling to hear the Chief Justice does not appear to be consistent with the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have previously met informally with the Chief Justice and also with his brother judges. I am more than willing to do so again to constructively engage in a dialogue about improving family law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Justice has apparently accused me of bias.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can happily reassure the Chief Justice on a number of points.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lastly, I would offer some free advice. The Chief Justice might examine and reflect on the evidence placed before the Committee by Terry O'Donahue.</PARA>

This is a case of the emperor's new clothes. We cannot all run around and say that everything is perfect and wonderful when we know it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example. The Family Court has always had the responsibility to provide counselling for people when their relationships and marriages are in strife, not before they are dead&mdash;what one might call proactive counselling. They have never ever done proactive counselling and all the while they have screamed about a lack of money. The truth of the matter is, looking at the report, that they have had heaps of money. Not only have they had heaps of money, but they have borrowed against future money. They have ticked it up on their Bankcard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it had not been for the Justice Statement this year, the Family Court would have been in serious financial strife. That Justice Statement money got them out of serious strife. I cannot answer the question: was the money spent for the purposes for which it was allocated? A person can have some reasonable suspicions, but that is on the record of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration has been a maverick administration. The Chief Justice of the Family Court is responsible for the administration of the court, but it has been a maverick administration. In what way has it been a maverick administration? They had a review of the court&mdash;the Buckley review&mdash;and the court went ahead and implemented the Buckley review's recommendations. It did not get the agreement of the Attorney-General's Department or the Department of Finance, but it went ahead and implemented them with no cost-benefit analysis. In fact, the report criticises the fact that cost-benefit analyses seem to be foreign to them. When they did a review of the Buckley review, they put in charge a very esteemed justice&mdash;Justice Buckley. He was reviewing his own review!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were a member of the government, and I said that we were following the same procedure with CES or DEET, opposition members would be attacking me as an irresponsible administrator. You have to say that the Chief Justice's action is irresponsible. I believe that the committee says that; the committee also says that we have to make a commitment to proactive counselling by getting it out of the Family Court. The court does require counselling. There is no argument about that. But it is a different question as to whether they should be court appointed counsellors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the long term we should follow New Zealand, where they have the money and they buy the resources. It works appropriately over there and I think it will work well with the Family Court. But the Family Court has shown&mdash;notwithstanding its rhetoric about the importance of court counselling&mdash;that it does not manage court counselling. In fact, it does not manage anything with a client focus very well at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the chamber of my speech where I referred to the extraordinary amounts of money that people are spending on family law. It is important that we should do a study to see how much money is being spent. We know how much legal aid is being spent and what proportion of that goes on family law, but we have absolutely no idea of what individuals are paying. Until we get an alternative to a litigation superhighway, we are not going to get anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I proposed a commission of the family. I am disappointed that idea is not being picked up. At its core it provided a choice for people doing it outside the courts and outside legal expense. But I believe the report in funding administration at least sets the foundations for reform. I would be surprised if, in the future, we do not see that eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been publicly critical of judicial productivity. It is interesting that the report calls for more registrars, but not so as increase the overall numbers of judicial officers. Maybe I am remiss in having raised so inelegantly the issue of judicial productivity&mdash;but I am vindicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those who were so keen to get behind the unfair attack of the Chief Justice on me, I say that they should read this report in detail. I say that any honourable member should read this report. It is an important report. It does not go so far as I would like, but it sets a platform for reform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been a privilege to have heard the previous speaker, the member for ChifIey (Mr Price). I listened carefully to him. I am not learned in such matters and I have not studied them in such detail, but I know of his great commitment and the effort that was put into the committee he referred to. I commend him for his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on a similar matter to the one mentioned by the previous speaker. The member for Aston (Mr Nugent) reminded us that we are dealing with people and we have to come to a practical reality of that situation. We know that we have a breakdown in marriages of about two in five, and it is predicted that will go to three in five by the year 2000. Those are figures produced by some learned students on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Aston and the member for Chifley referred to both the judiciary and the administration of justice. I think that the member for Aston said that it seemed to depend at times upon which judge you may draw in the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to put on the record today a constituent's experience and concern. That is one way I can relate this to the parliament. The name of the gentleman is Malcolm Klinger; he is from a small community called Port Broughton. His marriage ended up in an irretrievable breakdown and he found himself in the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell this from Malcolm Klinger's perspective. In his advice to me, he explained to me that his wife did not have a deadline to reply to lawyers requesting an alteration on custody. There was a contact agreement&mdash;not an access agreement; I learned that from the parliamentary secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) this morning&mdash;with his wife. His wife agreed to something and then backed away from it. He felt aggrieved by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he felt particularly aggrieved in the court hearing process itself, when there was a hearing to determine interim custody of the child. Malcolm's submission cost $5,000. His understanding was that the judge was not even able to read it. His wife, of course&mdash;after he had spent his $5,000&mdash;received legal aid. He felt that that $5,000 was wasted in the Family Court. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He very much felt that. But let me go on, to touch on some of the points that the member for Chifley was discussing when talking about maintenance for the child.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This happened at a time when farm interest rates were 17 per cent. He made the point that the government was able to give his wife a sole parent pension within 24 hours of her leaving him. Then the Child Support Agency asked for an amount which was equivalent to the income he was actually receiving from the farm. He had some other, investment, income, but some of that was from interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually&mdash;I guess it was not that long; within some months&mdash;he was left with the options of working on the farm for nothing, or leaving. So he left the farm in 1992. He now pays no child support, because he is unemployed. In fact, he is on a sickness benefit, but he would otherwise be entitled to unemployment benefit. There is one citizen's experience which, I think, backs up the comments that we have heard about the issues facing our Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finish on one issue. I am going to be very careful, because this issue is sub judice. I guess I prohibit myself from even discussing it, so I will finish that part of the comment. But when I see constituents come to me, and I see the agony, the tears and the complete disillusionment at the loss of a loved one, I, as a member of parliament, am totally at a loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that it is the fault of anyone in particular. All I know is that these people feel totally deserted by our system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with great interest to the contribution made by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), as well as the contribution made by my colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had, for a very long time, major concerns in relation to the operations of the Family Court. I do not wish to reflect on the judiciary, but I must say that, right from the time the Family Court was instituted, while I could fully understand why it was necessary to reform the family law, I was concerned that a special purpose court had been set up for family law matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally believe that this area of the law ought to have been dealt with in an ordinary court rather than in a court for matrimonial matters. I must say that I have had numerous complaints from people who feel that they have not had a fair go through the Family Court. They emerge from hearings sometimes feeling that they simply have not been listened to. I believe that confidence in our judicial system is absolutely vital and, when we do have a court about which so many complaints are made to honourable members on both sides of the House, it is appropriate for inquiries to take place into the efficiency of that court and the operation of that court to see what reforms are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, that was why I was particularly pleased that perhaps you granted some indulgence to the honourable member for Chifley, because you could see he had put a tremendous amount of effort into that report. You could see that he was greatly aggrieved by the attack made on him by the Chief Justice of the Family Court, and it would be, I believe, a perversion of the standing orders if a member of parliament were not able to have a right of reply. Fortunately the standing orders proved adequate for the honourable member for Chifley to express his point of view. It seems to me that he did have a very considerable amount of extra material which he would have liked to outline to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say I was somewhat tempted to move an extension of time. In the almost six years I have been a member of this place, in two terms and two manifestations, I have never before felt moved to permit a member opposite to have an extension of time, but it was clear that what the honourable member for Chifley was saying needed to be said. I hope that the government looks very closely at the speech made by the honourable member for Chifley, because the family law system is a very important part of our judicial system. As was mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Grey, some 40 per cent of Australians are now affected personally by the tragedy of divorce and 100 per cent of Australians are touched by the tragedy of divorce, because, if not affected personally, they have brothers and sisters and other members of the family and friends who are involved in divorces. It is important that people feel they are able to go to a system where their concerns are able to be addressed and where people are given a fair go by those who administer that particular avenue of the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill we are discussing today is the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995. While it is a bill that seeks to amend a large number of other pieces of legislation, this particular bill does not establish new principles. It seeks to build on the reforms of the Family Law Reform Bill 1994, which was broadly supported by the coalition. As a result of the passage of that legislation, it has been necessary, in the view of the government, to make consequential amendments to other acts, including the Australian Citizenship Act 1948, the Child Support Assessment Act 1988, the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988, the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977, the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987, the Marriage Act 1961, the Migration Act 1958, the Passports Act 1938, the Social Security Act 1991 and also the Evidence Act 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at a number of these changes which the government seeks to implement as a result of the bill we are currently debating, one wonders whether the government has been a little precious in some instances, because the changes are not changes of substance but merely changes of terminology. The principal bill, the Family Law Reform Bill 1994, sought to create a new culture in the area of custody and maintenance. It sought to do away with the idea that parents owned their children. The coalition did not oppose those particular changes but, when one looks at some consequential amendments which are sought to be implemented pursuant to this bill, one wonders if they are really worth the time of this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to detain the Main Committee at length by going into the many and varied changes which are being made, but one ought to look at, for instance, item 13 in schedule 1, where we are told that the proposed legislation we are now debating omits `liable parent' and substitutes the same words, but in bold type. One would have thought that, by any means of interpretation of the English language, the words `liable parent' in bold type mean exactly the same as the words `liable parent' in ordinary type. I dare say that those who draft these changes to legislation have to justify their existence, with the result that we are debating such an alteration. One looks at other suggestions where words like `entitled custodian' are replaced by `entitled carer', and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that, given we are going to create a new culture, it is deemed necessary to modernise the language, but, to be honest, it seems to me to be a little too precious when one looks at the large number of acts which are being changed. The important act is the Family Law Reform Bill 1994, which broadly had the support of both sides of the parliament, but now we are debating consequential changes which are not opposed by us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we join with the government in supporting the Family Law Reform (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1995, although I personally reiterate the concerns expressed by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) in relation to the Family Court system. Obviously the member opposite the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) would also have received very many complaints from his constituents in relation to family law, and it is important that, as parliamentarians, we get this area of the law right. We are dealing with an area of the law which involves human emotion. Many people have broken marriages and children resulting from those marriages. Sadly, so often, people have tended to use children as a means of getting at the other partner to the marriage, and this is tragic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although this legislation seeks to enshrine the welfare of the children as being paramount&mdash;I think that everyone supports this aim&mdash;it is important that the parliament continues to look at reform of family law. This bill and the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 both go some way towards reforming family law, but I hope the government considers the rest of the matters raised by the honourable member for Chifley. Since the Family Law Act has been in place now for close to 20 years, it is incumbent on the government to look at the matters raised by the honourable member for Chifley with some urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am pleased to conclude this debate by saying at the outset that I thank all honourable members who have contributed to the debate. I think it is fair to say that the debate this afternoon is an interesting example of the effective way in which the Main Committee gives members the opportunity to debate in a more measured manner than often occurs in the House of Representatives itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the comments that were made by honourable members have some validity and most of the contributions were made with the intention of contributing positively to the debate; I certainly took them in this regard. The high point of this debate is clearly the contribution by the member for Chifley (Mr Price). I noted his contribution, and he has raised some issues which bear further consideration. The government will certainly be looking at the points made by the member for Chifley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to reflect briefly on the contributions that some other members made earlier in the debate. It is important that people understand that the new changes that have been made to the Family Law Act in relation to children have quite dramatically changed the direction of the legislation. Instead of talking about the rights of divorcing parties in relation to their children, we are now talking about the rights of the children in these marriages as against the rights of the parents, so, from now on, everything which flows from this legislation will be couched in the context of the rights and interests of the children. This is a very important change&mdash;and a quite fundamental one&mdash;which has taken place as a result of the passage of the main piece of legislation</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we will see, over a period of time, a change in the culture of the Family Court and the application of the law in the area of divorce and marriage breakdown. We will see more concentration on solutions and outcomes and less concentration on the war itself and the battle between the waring parties. And that will be wholly good for the parties themselves and, of course, for their offspring, and will be much better for society at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critical thing that I want to say as my last point in this debate is that we in the parliament can only pass the legislation. It will be up to the Family Court and mediators, and others associated with divorce and marriage breakdown, and the context in which they operate to really determine how effective this legislation will be. We have passed a piece of legislation which has been dealt with extensively and with great consultation and which generally has the overwhelming support of interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if it is successful, if it does lower the temperature in divorces, if it does provide a mechanism by which parents can better arrange the affairs of their children following divorce, and if it is to give effect to the wishes and the will of the parliament, it will very much be up to the Family Court to deliver on the aspirations that are contained in these pieces of legislation. I do not want to say any more about that, but it ought to be recognised by people that we in the government and in the parliament can only pass legislation. We cannot, in these areas, interfere directly in the way that the courts operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have to have independence of the judiciary and of the courts, and it behoves the courts&mdash;the Family Court, in this particular instance&mdash;to act in a way which reflects the needs of society and the aspirations of society. I hope that this legislation will provide the platform upon which they will be able to do that in relation to matters concerning children and divorce. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr Lawrence</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes, government expenditure on what the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) defines as "Welfare Services" has increased by 41.2% in real terms in the five years to 1992-93; but no, this does not signify growing reliance on welfare services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Welfare Services" as defined by AIHW consists of child care support, family and child welfare services, aged and disabled welfare services, and services such as  supported accommodation, rent rebates, prisoners aid and English programs for migrants. It does not include social security payments, housing and community amenities or nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately half of the expenditure referred to is Commonwealth expenditure. The rest is State and Local Government expenditure. Of the Commonwealth expenditure, the great majority is in the areas of Aged Care, Disability Services and Family and Children's Services, for which my Department is responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in Commonwealth expenditure, described by the AIHW is overwhelmingly due to the combined effect of two factors:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">population increase, especially among the ageing; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an increased emphasis on  programs which help people to lead independent lives within the community (programs which the AIHW includes under "welfare services") and away from residential care in nursing homes (which it does not include under "welfare services").</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus the figures do not reflect growing reliance among individual community members on Government programs and provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aged Care and Disability Services</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth expenditure for the aged and people with a disability, for those areas classified as "welfare services" and reported in the AIHW Welfare Services Expenditure bulletin, increased from $552m in 1987-88 to $1,194m in 1992-93&mdash;a 78% increase in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth in expenditure must be seen in the context of growth in the target population, in this case those people over 70 years of age and over 80 years of age. Over the period, the total Australian population increased by 6.8%, while the population aged 70 and over&mdash;the target population for most aged care services&mdash;increased by 17.2% (202,000 persons). The population aged 80 and over, who are the greatest users of these services, increased by 24.2% (although four out of five people over the age of 70 do not use any aged care services).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in expenditure must also be seen in the context of a deliberate change in the balance of care and targeting of services. There has been a shift in the balance of care away from the provision of expensive and intensive nursing care to hostels and Home and Community Care (HACC). Hostel expenditure has increased over this period from $93m to $275m, a rise of approximately 134% in real terms. HACC expenditure increased from $168m to $342m, an increase of approximately 62% in real terms. In contrast nursing home benefits grew from $1,166m to $1,681m, a growth of only 14.7% in real terms. This shift has not only enabled nursing home growth to be contained but has also responded to people's wishes for more care options and especially for care at home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child Care</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth expenditure on family and child welfare services, as reported in the AIHW Welfare Services Expenditure bulletin, increased from $203m  in 1987-88 to $557m in 1992-93, a 126% increase in real terms. This increase reflects the large growth in child care places funded by the Commonwealth over this period. The primary objective of this Program is to assist families with dependent children to participate in the workforce&mdash;which in turn reduces the likelihood  of them being dependent on Government for their subsistence. The Child Care Program is an important labour support program to assist families with parents in the labour force. The Program also assists families with a parent at home to access affordable developmental opportunities for their children.</PARA>
