<PARA>The development at Clayton will be designed to accommodate the 130 staff from Port Melbourne, including a number of visitors and students. The staff will include 70 research personnel; 54 personnel in management, administration and research support; and six visiting scientists and students. Completion of the project is expected by late 1997. The proposed complex will be consistent with the long-term CSIRO strategy to integrate and consolidate compatible research resources and facilities on a small number of major regional sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Port Melbourne site is a converted paint factory on a state government lease.

The proposed complex will amalgamate two research groups of the newly formed Division of Minerals who are currently dispersed&mdash;one being at Clayton and the other at Port Melbourne. The amalgamation will allow improved communications between the two groups in synergy with other CSIRO divisions already on the Clayton site and at Monash University. </PARA>

<PARA>There is a need to provide adequate housing for service families posted to Townsville, for which the Defence Housing Authority&mdash;referred to as the DHA&mdash;is responsible. Originally, DHA formed a joint venture with Delfin Property Group to tender for an attractive parcel of land at Douglas in Townsville. Unfortunately, the tender was unsuccessful. But soon after DHA, on behalf of the joint venture, successfully negotiated the acquisition of 107 hectares of land at Kirwan  known as the Willows, which was available for sale by the receivers of Kern Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DHA acquired the land on behalf of the joint venture, subject to the approval of the public works committee and the minister. The joint venture has proceeded with the development of a portion of the land on the eastern side of the main stormwater drain with the approval of the public works committee and wishes to proceed with the development of the balance of the land. It is intended that the DHA acquire approximately 25 per cent of the lots from the joint venture at a reasonable discount and thereon provide new housing for service families which has been specifically designed for the local climate. The total development cost for the joint  venture is estimated to be $37 million. However, the maximum exposure for DHA is approximately $3.8 million in mid-1995.

<PARA>This bill amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to initiatives announced in the context of the 1994-95 budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the opportunity to eventually speak to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. This bill amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to the following budget initiatives: $8.7 million is to be provided in 1995 to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling; $4 million is to be allocated in 1995 to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing program which supports eight languages in each state and territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I personally might decide on 1 September. What do you reckon? That might be a good start. I would even be prepared to extend that to 30 September if it would make it any easier for you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fully understand many of this bill's implications, it is important to have a background understanding of what these measures involve. With regard to the new schools policy, in order to gain provisional approval and eventually final approval for general recurrent funding, schools must meet certain eligibility criteria, including an advanced notification requirement and a sufficiently high funding priority. Under the 1992 act, a school wishing to operate at a new location, amalgamate, provide an additional level of education or separate into two or more schools must give notice two years before 1 March in the year in which the change is proposed. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 extends this notice period to three years before 31 October for changes proposed on or after 1 January 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 23 of this bill introduces a further notification requirement for changes or proposals intended to occur on or after 1 January 1998 so that notification of a change or proposal to be funded in 1998 will be required by 31 October 1995. Keep in mind, Mr Speaker, that we are already a quarter of the way into 1995 and not only has this bill not been passed but one must question the ability of schools which have not acted pending the outcome of this bill to give adequate notification by the end of October this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition maintains its policy position of the last election, which is to abandon the new schools policy. Make no mistake about it: Labor has always been philosophically opposed to non-government school education, and this policy is just one example of this outdated philosophical position. The principal objective of this policy is to make it as difficult as possible for new schools to start. It is that simple. The policy is opposed to real parental choice in schooling, with the post-1992 funding policy effectively pricing non-government schools out of the reach of many parents. The coalition is committed to parental choice in schooling and we believe that this should be an affordable choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the block grants authority proposal, under the general element grant administered by DEET, funds are provided in the form of block grants to state education authorities for the government sector and to block grant authorities&mdash;BGAs&mdash;for the non-government sector. There are two BGAs in each state&mdash;one Catholic and one independent&mdash;and there is a joint Catholic-independent BGA in both the Northern Territory and the ACT. This bill amends the principal act by removing the requirement to re-approve a block grant authority every time a school or hostel joins or leaves a BGA. I am sure the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) will be pleased to hear that this proposal is supported by the coalition, as it will clearly not only simplify the existing arrangements but also will do away with unnecessary administrative burdens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority language incentive element&mdash;PLIE&mdash;has been aimed at promoting a collaborative effort with the states to improve national proficiency in languages other than English. The objective of the element has been to provide financial incentives to increase the number of students studying priority languages other than English at the year 12 level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also has the effect of curtailing the operations of the priority languages element to the program years 1993 and 1994, and to give effect to a new program to replace the PLIE from the beginning of program year 1995. The new program will provide grants to government and non-government education authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the serious decline in skills in languages other than English needs to be addressed. We believe that skills in languages other than English are also important for Australia's international competitiveness. It is clear that successful exporters tend to be companies that have staff skilled in the language of their non-English speaking customers or potential customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now return to the new schools policy amendment of the bill. The coalition has long been opposed to the government's draconian new schools policy. The policy is restrictive, intrusive and designed to restrict true parental choice. The coalition has been vehemently opposed to this policy since its introduction. It is an issue on which we believe very strongly and it is an issue on which we have consistently campaigned in successive elections. Unlike the government, the coalition still listens to those who work in the field of non-government schools. They have said to us that the policy should be renamed the `no new schools policy' as it significantly retards new schools growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor is philosophically opposed to non-government schooling and private education. It has been for a long time, and the new schools policy is a manifestation of its disdain for this sector. The government in its arrogance is proud of this policy. We on this side remember all too well being continually chastised for our policy to abolish the new schools policy, a policy position, I am proud to say, we will implement on our return to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, now Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), declared in a press release prior to the last election that to abandon the new schools policy would be to `abandon the government's stable, needs-based system school funding'. In a speech to the National Press Club on 19 October 1992, the former minister emphatically stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition promised to scrub the New Schools Policy which places some sensible restraints on the growth of the non-government school sector. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has an understandable pride of ownership in major achievements . . . The strength of that pride is reflected in the strength of our concern when such achievements are so obviously threatened.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the former minister, the coalition's policies would threaten the school system, `facing a threat to its quality and equitable funding base'. Let all members of this chamber be very clear on the government's position on the new schools policy. To abolish this policy would be to adopt&mdash;and I again quote from a press release by the former minister&mdash;`out of date and unworkable education policies'. So wedded is the government to its policy, so proud is the government of its stranglehold over non-government sector that in this very chamber on 7 October 1992 the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I repeat `not'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">abandon the propositions that we have in place under the new schools policy proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How things have changed. The government has now buckled under the pressure of the opposition and the non-government sector, especially the Christian schools, with the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) announcing on the first of this month a review of the shameful policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read with great interest his press release on this issue, which will go down in the non-government school sector as one of the great opportunistic policy reversals in living memory. The press release announced the view, and in doing so, gave the most spurious of reasons for the policy backflip and that is, `that the environment in which schools operate has changed'. And the evidence for this? According to the minister, it is the expanded use of computers and increased retention rates. How this in any way can be used as justification for the review will be lost on the non-government sector.It is a proposition that totally lacks any credibility. What the press release should have stated was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government has decided to review the way new, non-government schools are assessed for Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA>I will give the minister a copy of this so that he can put it out this afternoon. It goes on:</PARA>

This is the minister's press release that he is going to put out this afternoon. It further states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for continuing to have a policy setting which is anti the establishment of new non-government schools. In his explanation for the reason for the backflip, the minister said, "Well, in all honesty I've been getting so much pressure from the Opposition and non-government sector, especially those in the Christian education sector, that I thought it unwise to go to the next election without having said something that might try to placate them.</PARA>
<PARA>The last paragraph of that press release should read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister went on to say that he had asked for the review to be finalised in March 1996, which in all likelihood, meant that he would not be required to make a decision before the next election.</PARA>
<PARA>Put in its simplest terms, the terms of reference of the review make a mockery of the bill. The bill and the direction it takes in relation to the new schools policy only seek to re-enforce the wide-held belief that the latest review smacks of no more than political expediency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You agree with that. This review should be seen in the context of the bigger picture and that is the utter hypocrisy of the government that is trying to curry favour with a group whose opposition to the government is mounting while at the same time instructing the various government departments to look at ways to slash funding to the non-government sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the minister saw press comments some months ago about proposed cuts to the education sector and would be aware that if they were to come into place it would totally decimate Australia's non-government sector. I must admit that I really am very surprised that the minister did not move to in any way cut short the debate on this. There was no denial from him. Nothing at all came out which would indicate that he either supported or denied those mooted cost cuttings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that must be asked, given his silence, is whether he is indicating support for the proposed measures. Equally importantly, may they become a budget reality as opposed to a departmental review? The other matter of great concern to the school sector is the government's constant about face and buck passing in relation to various matters of great concern to the school sector. I vividly remember holding the government to account for the drastic decline in retention rates, only to be told by the minister in a press release of 30 January 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Member for Ballarat criticises the Federal Government because retention rates were down in the past year. But it is the states which have responsibility for running schools.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister seems to forget that on 30 May 1993 in this chamber, when talking about retention rates, Minister Beazley stated :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is a reflection of the extraordinary extent to which this government has been prepared to invest in the development of our higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA>On 4 June 1994, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) boasted to this House, `Of course we have now increased retention rates in schools to nearly 80 per cent.' However, the most glaring statement to this House which makes crystal clear the extent of the minister's duplicity was made on 8 November 1994. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Everybody knows that this government's policies have achieved an absolute revolution in school retention rates.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears that everyone knows who is responsible for the retention rates except you or, should I say, only when it is convenient for you to know. The minister is trying to emulate the feats of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) whose selective memory is legend not only in this House but also in the state of Western Australia. Let us be in no doubt that through the review of the new schools policy, and the possible slashing of funds to the non-government sector, we are seeing the government establish a framework to avoid taking responsibility for the non-government sector. This is Labor's true commitment to the non-government school sector. </PARA>

The coalition supports this measure and we believe it is long overdue. However, Australian parents have every cause to be doubtful as to how well this initiative will work once implemented.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to place on record the initiatives we have had to date from Labor over 12 years in office. We have had the International Literacy Year 1990; the literacy challenge, strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children, December 1992; International Literacy Day on 8 September 1990; early literacy programs; adult literacy programs; the 1991 Australian language and literacy policy; the `Book it' program of 1990; and the literacy awards in 1992&mdash;and the government is currently administering a national literacy survey. Not only is the minister, in his own words, not sure of the end result of these past efforts on the state of our literacy, but up to 25 per cent of Australian school children are battling literacy problems. What is needed is accountability and testing of basic skills. States such as Victoria and New South Wales are showing much needed leadership in this area.

I support the view of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> that indeed it is something that should be between the school and parents. I would not like to see any system where children themselves are put at risk through being handed documentation about their basic literacy skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But surely the question of testing is not something that this minister or this government should be opposed to. I would have thought it was basic to ascertain whether there are problems and, if there are problems, then you can address them. The only way they can be addressed, if you do not avoid the problems, I suspect will come out in the truancy inquiry. The minister knows that I am a member of that committee, and I suspect that he and I will be fairly horrified at its outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the move to find out the levels of truancy because, until we find out what they are and ascertain some of the reasons, we will not be able to address what is a continuing and growing community problem. I think we will probably find, and indeed there seems to be plenty of evidence to support this, that basic literacy problems lead to truancy problems. So I draw the attention of the minister to that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>editorial as I think it really sums up the position we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern is that the lowest common denominator has become the benchmark in Australia's education system as a direct result of the lack of testing. Labor is now torn between its union mates and the figures which show that little has been achieved by listening to them in the past. The time has come for some accountability in the education system, but this will not happen under the present government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been informed that one of the reasons for the delay with this bill is the issue of supplementation. I have been informed that, although supplementation of recurrent grants is usually paid at the end of the schooling year, this was not the case in 1994. The reason, it would appear, was that the unexpectedly high amount of supplementation caused the minister to give long consideration to whether he would fulfil the government's commitment to supplementation in line with movements in the AGSRC. However, the government will now be paying supplementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote from the February edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Parents Council Review</EMPHASIS>. I am sure when the seconder to the motion arrives he will be extremely anxious to support the comments that I will make in relation to this matter. I am sure the imminent arrival of the seconder will make that task considerably easier. It is good to see the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) here; I know he has great concerns about education in his electorate as well.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The supplementation amount, the Government says, will serve to meet the Commonwealth Government's share of any additional costs to school and system authorities to cover the Australian Vocational Training System and will also offset demands for any extra funding the non-government schooling sector makes for superannuation, special education and capital needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government says that the 5.1% supplementation outcome is particularly high when compared with, for example, a Consumer Price Index . . . In the light of this, the Commonwealth Government states that it will be revising the components of the AGSRC.</PARA>

A revised index is under consideration. In the meantime supplementary payments for schools for 1994 will be paid as soon as possible."</PARA>
<PARA>What is the council's response to this attempt by the government to push them into a corner? I again quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A.P.C. Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt non-government school authorities and organisations will be vitally concerned with this and any other proposed outcome of revision of the AGSRC.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns we have with this bill have been shown to be legitimate to the extent that, even the minister acknowledges the new schools policy&mdash;which this bill serves to further restrict&mdash;needs further review.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have witnessed in this House would almost be comical if it were not so serious. We have a piece of legislation which is virtually unravelling as we speak. We have a minister who is at odds with his predecessor and with his party's policies. In all this, we also have the non-government school sector looking for nothing more than security and a commitment to honour past promises. This is not how it should be and this is not how it will be under a coalition government. </PARA>

I think the minister can see that this is an extremely serious matter concerning not only the coalition but also the non-government sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an extraordinary amount of cynicism, especially in the Christian schools, as to why a discussion paper can be released by July but the review can be put off until March 1996. There can be only two reasons for this: it is either a political stunt during the election campaign or the fervent hope of the minister that the matter will go well past the next election and he will go into the next election saying, `Well, I can't do anything until the review of the new schools policy is released.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening closely to the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), and I say to him at the outset that I, along with other government members, refute totally the suggestion that the ALP is in any way philosophically opposed to non-government school education. I think the member for Ballarat, along with many of his colleagues, has lapsed in time back to the lacklustre days of Menzies when the state aid debate raged through this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the history of government funding for non-government schools brings enormous credit to the Australian Labor Party. Funding of non-government schools in this country was first proposed by a Labor government in New South Wales in the early 1960s&mdash;a Labor government in the early sixties wanting to fund, for the first time, non-government schools. To this proposition Menzies responded, typically as a political opportunist, with a limited proposal for the federal funding of non-government schools and their science blocks. The truth of the matter is that substantial federal funding of those schools did not come into place until the election of the Whitlam Labor government in 1972 and establishment of the Australian Schools Commission in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I provide the member for Ballarat with some of the background. The national government has been providing funding for specific purposes for schools in Australia since 1964&mdash;that limited Menzies proposition. Since that time, both the scope and size of Commonwealth outlays for schooling have increased substantially. Expenditure on school education through the various states grants acts has grown from $9.9 million in 1964-65&mdash;that is, less than $10 million after 15 years of Menzies Liberal government. The member for Ballarat should note that. He talked about truancy. He must have been playing truant when it came to Australian political history lessons during his time at school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grants and aid grew from less than $10 million during the period of Menzies to outlays in 1994 of over $1 billion for government schools and $1,563 million for non-government schools&mdash;$1.5 billion of Commonwealth assistance for non-government schools established and confirmed by this Labor government. For the member for Ballarat to suggest that there is any philosophical opposition to non-government school education on the part of the Keating government is an absurdity. I am sure that the member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), a strong supporter of non-government and government schools throughout the country and his own electorate, would agree that the schools would all say, `If that is the philosophical opposition of the Australian Labor Party in 1994-95&mdash;$1.5 billion of funding for non-government schools&mdash;let's have more of it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absurdity for the member for Ballarat to base his whole argument on a question of philosophical opposition by the ALP to non-government schools. He has lapsed comfortably back from his perspective to the lacklustre era of Menzies and that redundant state aid debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the substance of this legislation, its purpose is essentially threefold: to require greater notice of proposals to establish new non-government schools which seek government funding or alter the status of non-government schools receiving government funding; to introduce procedures for situations where additional levels of education are introduced progressively at a particular school; and to establish a list of priority languages for which Commonwealth grants shall be paid. I support these purposes entirely, but I also wish to make some broader observations about the effectiveness of the nation's school education system. I do so against a background of rapid change in teaching and the learning environment in Australia's schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my lifetime, and it is an experience which I am sure has been shared by the member for Parramatta, there have been two great changes in the school education system. The first is, as I have mentioned, Commonwealth involvement&mdash;substantial Commonwealth funding of both the government and non-government school sectors. Unfortunately, this has not led to the creation of a national system. We have had enormous growth in national funding, but we are yet to establish a national school education system in Australia. We are still relying on eight state and territory based systems. There are obvious problems such as a lack of coordination, a lack of efficiency, a lack of integration and the tremendous difficulties that arise with students who, because of their parents moving across territorial and state boundaries, move into new education systems with different standards, different curricula and different requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change in school education during my lifetime has been the convergence of general and vocational education. Schools have become much more concerned, particularly in the past decade, with the question of employability and the provision of broad vocational education. This represents a convergence not only of general and vocational education in schools but also a convergence between the concept of work and the concept of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now recognised that the most successful forms of work organisation are those which encourage people to be multiskilled, creative and adaptable. In this sense, the quality of Australia's school education system has become a key determinant of competitive advantages and disadvantages for the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the proliferation and pace of international capital movements, human resources and skills have become the primary means by which national economies compete against each other. All other factor markets&mdash;resources, capital formation and technological progress&mdash;have jumped over and well beyond national boundaries, particularly with the development of knowledge-based industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1950s and 1960s in Australia young people looked forward to employment once they, through the school education system, had acquired relatively simple and repetitious skills. This was because our economy was organised around systems of high-volume, standardised production. Whether in agriculture, manufacturing or office work, each employee took a simple but interconnected part in the production process through which productivity was guaranteed by high volumes and low unit costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Skill requirements for adaptability and innovation were restricted to a small group of managers who planned and designed the production process. Most workers simply followed orders within the limits of rigid work roles and job classifications. If they did this with due discipline and tolerance, then their working life would most likely require just one set of simple trade based skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1970s and 1980s, however, this mechanistic production process was transformed by the advent of knowledge-based technology. This has flattened the old production hierarchy and given workers a much better chance to contribute innovations and ideas to the production process. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A successful working life in the 1990s requires a range of adaptable skills, with a lifetime commitment to training and retraining, multiskilling and reskilling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have also been a function of Australia's new trading position. Following the elimination of old protectionist policies and tariff walls, it would have been much harder for Australia to compete against cheap labour nations if the competitive environment still relied on high volume-low cost, standardised methods of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our only feasible option has been to compete not on the basis of the cost of labour but through the value of labour&mdash;the capacity of Australian workers to add value, quality, flexibility and ideas to the production process. By this strategy we produce not only more interesting work in Australia, not only more cooperative and successful workplaces but, most importantly, we preserve the integrity of our national values and aspirations for a high wage-high employment economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take inspiration and guidance from the policies outlined by the US Labour Secretary, Robert Reich, in his 1989 book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The resurgent liberal</EMPHASIS>. Of course, he is talking about small `l' liberals. There is nothing resurgent about the big `L' Liberals in this place. Reich, nonetheless, states in his book from 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for managers this path means continuously retraining employees for more complex tasks, automating in ways that cut routine tasks and enhance worker flexibility and creativity, diffusing responsibility for innovation, taking seriously labour's concern for job security and giving the workers a stake in improved productivity via profit-linked bonuses and stock plans. For workers this means accepting flexible job classifications and work rules, agreeing to wage rates linked to productivity improvements, and generally taking greater responsibility for the soundness and efficiency of the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA>Reich goes on to outline how such an economy relies, above all, on a work force capable of rapid learning. The key transformation is how policy makers in this area, including the member for Ballarat, should be linking changes in the nature of work to changes in the school education system. Reich has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the future economy will depend to an even greater extent on thinking, rather than repeating learned information, future reforms must motivate teachers and students alike to engage in the process of learning. Rather than prescribe exactly what should be learned and how and when the information should be doled out, reformers should aim at improving students' capacity to learn . . . . rather than teach students to assume that problems and solutions are generated by others (as they were under high-volume standardised production), students should be led to understand that problems and questions are created . . . . the emphasis should be on allowing students to experiment for themselves with solving the problems they help define.</PARA>
<PARA>One could not find a better statement of the challenge for educators and education policy makers in the 1990s&mdash;to have teachers who engage students in the process of learning. I think that matches the experience that members of parliament would have had in their own school years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies have found that few people remember any amount of the content they were taught at school. The lasting significance of the school education system is to pick up a certain way of learning, a certain way of thinking. That is a very important point to understand. It is not so much the content that people take away from school, not so much the rote learning and knowledge; it is a process of learning, a way of thinking. If we use this commonsense proposition&mdash;something that happens in any case in the school education system&mdash;we can certainly produce schooling in Australia in the 1990s better suited to the new nature of work and changes in employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The link between school education and employment is still, by my assessment, underestimated in the public debate. Our emphasis in this parliament and through government policy in recent years has been on post-school training and retraining&mdash;such as the Working Nation program implemented by DEET. This, unfortunately, by my assessment has left the school education system and its contribution to training and work force skills as a second order consideration. It should not be so. It should be a first order consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, the comprehensive system has focused on minimum standards across the nation without linkages to regional economic development. Even so, fast growing regions have been under-resourced in education through the recent period of spending restraint. Yet these are the areas that require the greatest boost to human skills. As Gregory and Hunter concluded from their study of the spatial structure of the labour market:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The structural change of Australian employment into less manual work in the service sector has favoured those workers in the good regions with more education. The workers in the low status areas have largely failed to secure employment in the growth industries and appear to move into the unemployment pool once they lose their jobs in manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA>This highlights a failure to match the school education system to the economic restructuring process still under way in Australia. The process of restructuring has changed the nature and the definitions we apply to work force skills. In the 1950s and 1960s it was assumed that white-collar work was relatively high skilled and that blue-collar work would be relatively low skilled. Now, with an internationalised economy in the 1990s, there is an entirely different definition of skills and their requirements in employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the traded sector, the sector exposed to international competition, that requires the highest level of skills, be that in white- or blue-collar work. Close to my electorate, I recall an inspection of the Alcatel factory where the workers were producing telephone switching equipment for a large market in China. They were not wearing blue overalls but white lab coats. This reflects how the manufacturing work environment now requires an intensely capable level of education and skill development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the non-traded sector that is more likely to have the relatively low skill base. This refers to those sectors of the economy, such as community services and the retail sector, that are not exposed to international competition and not part of any internationalised production process. This demonstrates some of the problems that have occurred in making the transformation, the adjustment, in skills and job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unhappily, there has been a concentration of unemployment in a group of regional economies. Poverty rates have become a problem. Welfare dependency has become a problem. In fact, the correlation between public housing, poverty rates and unemployment is strong, based on location. My colleague the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) has said that you can predict someone's employment and lifetime aspirations based on their postcode. Unfortunately, with unemployment and rates of poverty, that has become a reality on a regional scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to rethink the training agenda and understand that the school education system can potentially play a strong role in making young people job ready. While the government is justly proud of the huge rise in school retention rates since 1983, these figures say nothing about the quality and suitability of education for students who would otherwise have left school after years 9 or 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strong correlation between students who respond poorly to an academic style school curriculum and long-term unemployment. Education policies need to address the needs of young people who disconnect themselves from the academic learning environment. The limited data available to the green paper on long-term unemployment in 1993 year suggested that between 10 and 20 per cent of students require special assistance to enhance basic literacy skills. This problem is particularly acute in disadvantaged regions, reflected ultimately in higher rates of long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's substantial investment in DEET training programs for the young long-term unemployed&mdash;especially those dealing with personal development skills&mdash;is in many ways correcting problems which arose at a much younger age in the school education system. The cost effectiveness of government outlays&mdash;federal and state&mdash;would be substantially improved by addressing the needs of these students at years 9 and 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the initiative in Working Nation to progress vocational based education, a vocational based curriculum and work experience for years 11 and 12 through the Australian student traineeship system. Along with the honourable member for Bourke (Mr O'Keefe), who has written a discussion paper on this subject, I urge the government to extend the Australian student traineeships into years 9 and 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compared with other OECD nations, Australia has a low participation rate of its 15- to 18-year-olds in vocational education. We need to turn that around. We turn it around by applying work experience and vocation based training not only in years 11 and 12, but also years 9 and 10. The education system in this country has traditionally been seen as a source of meritocracy; the great equality of opportunity and great liberator of the disadvantaged. This was true during the period of full employment in Australia, but it is a more difficult proposition to sustain when the country has less than full employment; especially when, with the greater emphasis on labour force skills, access to employment depends, firstly, on how well someone performs within the school education system and, secondly, where someone lives&mdash;his or her post code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to reassess the role school education can play in the internationalised economic environment, and particularly how to best improve the regional economic opportunities. I briefly outline four reforms worthy of consideration by policy makers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first proposition is to end the dominance of universities in setting the school curriculum. Unlike other OECD nations, industry and vocational considerations have little input in Australia. The tertiary entrance score and rank is designed for entry into university, not for work force entrance. There needs to be a shift from this 1960s model where the smarter kids go on to university and the rest get a job in the full employment labour market. That is no longer the environment in the 1990s. There needs to be greater input from business people, industry leaders and those interested in vocational training to ensure the entrance score and rank in year 12 is based as much around vocational work force needs as for tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second proposition is to end the dichotomy between general and vocational education. I refer honourable members to the outstanding report in December last year by the Schools Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The role of schools in the vocational preparation of Australia's senior secondary students.</EMPHASIS> That report outlines the way in which an integrated system can be developed in Australia to ensure that not only our academic standards&mdash;literacy and numeracy&mdash;are sound, but also that schools provide the best opportunity for vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third proposition is to rethink the way in which the disadvantaged schools program is run, to try to adapt to new opportunities for parental training and parental involvement in the education system, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and to use the new technology on the so-called information superhighway. My fourth proposition is to change the nature of teacher training so that it adapts to the new economic environment. Again I refer members to page 78 of the Schools Council report. They are the four propositions. I look forward to elaborating on each of these propositions in greater depth on another occasion as the government continues its outstanding record on school education. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 today I think some overview should be taken of the situation in education today. If we had suggested 50 or 100 years ago that from now on half of our lifetime&mdash;20 or 30 years&mdash;should be taken up with training in the work force and that people of 26 years of age would still be in a training mode and be unable to move out into the real world, people would think that there was something wrong with us intellectually or psychologically.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Today we have reached not only that place in our development but, with very deep regret, a worse aspect of the education system where, if we had suggested 100 years ago to people that from now on the only way they can become a doctor is if they are born to be a doctor, you are put through a series of tests&mdash;some would argue that they are aptitude tests, but whatever the case may be; they change the grading system in Queensland every three years on some sort of mythical basis that it is not going to remove the competitiveness, but in my experience it only makes the competitiveness greater&mdash;and if you are not able to achieve a score of 995 then you will not become a doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of caring and intelligent people who would be absolutely wonderful doctors. It was rather intriguing that the college at the University of Queensland, which I had the great honour of being president of when I was there, introduced a system where we elected a resident doctor, a resident lawyer and a resident expert in each field so that anyone in the college who had a legal problem could go along to the resident lawyer and get advice, and similarly with the resident doctor. The resident experts were people in their last year or two years of their course or who may have been tutoring in their profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bloke who was elected from our college as the resident doctor was not the brightest fellow.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was elected two years in a row, despite having failed three years of the course, to my memory, because the people did not want an Albert Einstein looking after them. They wanted someone who cared about them and someone who, if he did not have the knowledge, would have the humility to go to someone who did have the knowledge to find out what needed to be done to fix them up. When the students were given the choice of whom they wanted, even people that had come out of the apex, if you like, of the academic system of the colleges at Queensland University&mdash;you had to have a very high mark to get in there in the first place&mdash;they did not opt for the academic achiever; they opted for the carer. But no longer in the state of Queensland&mdash;and I am quite confident in every other state in Australia&mdash;is that available to society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I had a number of high school students over in their final year for lunch I asked, `Are you happy with the system?' One student&mdash;one of this kid's forebears was of Aboriginal descent and his parents were not wealthy; they had very humble, low income jobs&mdash;said, `No, I am not happy with the system at all because I would like to be an engineer and I have no hope of ever becoming an engineer.' I asked him, `Why? Explain that to me.' He said, `Because, under subjective assessment, I have got a teacher who does not like me.' I asked if he could prove that, and he said, `Yes, as a matter of fact, I can. I have been scoring 3 1/2 out of seven in my essays in English. I put the same essay I scored 3 1/2 on to the new teacher who came three weeks ago and she gave me a six. Other teachers who looked at this have said, "Yes, you should be getting a six." Unfortunately, I had a blue with her and she has taken it out on me, and that's my fate.

He said that a Harvard MBA almost guaranteed you a senior position in the Bank of New South Wales or the National Bank. He said, `Can you imagine one of those bright young elitist "gifts to the world" being taken to dinner in a Rolls Royce by the likes of tough, rough nuts like Alan Bond? Do you really think he would have had the temerity to raise the issue of security value at the lunch? Not likely! It would have been naive for a person of his stature to talk of such a petty matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another very important issue needs to be canvassed.

With one exception, which was radio, the other 22 major breakthroughs&mdash;whether they were television, the electric light, the telephone, the motor car, the internal combustion engine, refrigeration, the polarisation of light or photography&mdash;were achieved by people who had no tertiary qualifications. Isn't that interesting? A lot of people in argument to that would say that in the old days a lot of people did not have tertiary qualifications. I expect that argument, but the instamatic camera and the polarisation of light were pretty recent inventions of Edwin Land. The jet engine, which was effectively invented in the last year or two of the Second World War, was another invention by a person without tertiary qualifications. </PARA>

Edward De Bono would say that he is an absolutely hopeless ass when it comes to formulating something new. As one person put to me recently, `The last thing in the world we want is someone on steel rails. We want a four-wheel drive operator.'

As many model T Fords were sold as all the cars sold in the rest of the world put together. Here was a person who had built the motor car. I think other people could claim to have built the motor car but, if we had to look to someone who was the most successful inventor of the motor car, we would look no further than him.

They found out that the metal alloys being used were vastly superior. So the Ford group, which at the time was probably the biggest and most successful company in the world, monetary wise, searched the world for the best metallurgist they could find. They found him, after searching the world, in the Ford factory: it was a kid who had been paid to sweep. He was shoved over to be a worker in metallurgy and rose to be the head of the metallurgy section. He was the person that knew most about metallurgy in the whole world. They had the money to buy the best. They had the money to search the world for the best and the best was already there.

With every successive wave of evolution, the giant armadillo clothed itself in more and more armour plating until, eventually, it was invulnerable from attack from any other animal that walked the earth. It was a great evolutionary achievement. However, there was one problem. The armour was so heavy the armadillo could not forage for food and it very rapidly became extinct. There are no giant armadillos today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing I have to say today is that, sadly, without an education almost every door is closed. In society today, with the crushing of the agricultural sector in Australia by this government and other governments&mdash;I do not hesitate to say that&mdash;and the crushing of small business, all doors are now closed. The corporations own everything. The corporations will own everything so, if you cannot get a job with a corporation or the government&mdash;you most certainly cannot get jobs with them without degrees or tertiary qualifications&mdash;every door of opportunity is closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Nowadays, not only do people living outside the cities and very large towns not have a right to tertiary education but also they do not have a right to secondary education. Areas I represent in North Queensland, such as Feluga, Normanton, Georgetown, Burketown, Richmond and Julia Creek&mdash;and, sadly, soon probably towns like Winton&mdash;will be left without secondary education. Recently, the Julia Creek school lost all of its secondary department. The only way people in these areas can secure an education is to go away to boarding school. There is no other way it can be done. It is ludicrous to say that people can gain a secondary education by correspondence. There is too much competitiveness out there, and figures clearly indicate that that is the case. Very few even try. There is no secondary education in those sorts of areas unless you can go away to boarding school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a young person, unless you were rich you could not go to boarding school. By Cloncurry standards, I was lucky enough to belong to a rich family and was able to go away to school. Later on, if you were of Aboriginal descent, you could go to boarding school. I can remember being embarrassed that I had this great advantage over 80 per cent of the kids in Cloncurry. I could go as far as I wanted to because I had a secondary education and they did not. Kids from boarding schools walked with pride. They had been out in the bigger world and tried themselves against bigger people. They had this thing called education, which they could intimidate everybody else with for the rest of their days. It was very sad. I can remember the embarrassment I felt during those years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was lucky enough to be in a government which pioneered in Australia equality of education, so education in Queensland was provided on an equal basis for every single person. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the entire cost of going away to boarding school was picked up by the state and federal governments. Because of the inaction of this House, and because of the inaction of the Queensland government, now only half the cost of sending children away to boarding school is covered. I am not talking about elitist GPS schools, as we call them in Queensland; I am talking about ordinary garden variety service schools, which are the sorts of schools I boarded at in Charters Towers. They believe they have a duty to provide something the kids must have, which is a secondary education at the cheapest possible cost. </PARA>

It is impossible. We are now back to the bad old days where education is available only&mdash;I am not talking about tertiary education; I am talking about secondary education&mdash;to the rich or those of Aboriginal descent, whose numbers are much smaller.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to support this bill, which amends the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992. The changes this bill will introduce will enable the government to provide additional funding to enhance early literacy development, and the important task of providing education in 10 priority languages. I will come to that area later, particularly in relation to Aboriginal languages. I was a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in 1992, which looked into Aboriginal languages, and I will refer to that report later. A lot of things are pertinent to what we are speaking about today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should begin by saying that there are few more important tasks than the one Australia's 220,000 teachers carry out every day of their working lives&mdash;it is important to acknowledge the work of the educators of our children&mdash;namely, educating our children and helping them become responsible citizens not only in this country but in the whole world. There are few jobs that would be more challenging and ultimately more rewarding. I understand that the Australian Teaching Council is attempting to have International Teachers Day acknowledged and celebrated every year. I wish them well in that pursuit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will give effect to the initiatives announced in the 1994-95 budget, including the provision of $8.7 million in 1995 to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling, and the provision of $4 million in 1995 to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing one which supports eight languages in each state and territory. The bill also gives effect to changes to strengthen the Commonwealth's new schools policy from the new and changing non-government schools, changes to simplify administrative arrangements for improving block grant authorities under the capital grants program for schools, and funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools for 1995 and funding schedules for grants for community language for 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is an example of this government's commitment to education for young Australians, the country's future. It is an outstanding commitment that this government has shown over the many years it has been in office. I think we would all agree that the key to a successful future, both as individuals and as a nation, is a good education. The member  for Kennedy was probably right in highlighting the need for a good education, which is available to many young people today. Australia can be justifiably proud of its record in providing a good education to our children, and the high rate of school retention to year 12&mdash;currently near the 80 per cent mark&mdash;shows that the policies of the past have been winners with young Australians. They are the policies of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people recognise&mdash;as have several governments of the past, and as this one certainly does&mdash;that their future lies in gaining a good education, particularly one with a solid grounding in the technology that is already playing such a large part in their lives. It is also best if students can get an early start in quality education. That is one of the things that this bill proposes to do. It continues the Labor government's strong commitment both ideologically and materially to an effective schooling system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A brief analysis of Commonwealth funding and the level of enrolments over 1988-92 clearly illustrates this commitment. In each year of that period, the percentage increase in funding actually exceeded the percentage increase in enrolments. So we could say that the federal government has had funding levels that have exceeded the growth in demand for student numbers. This is enhanced further when we consider the current figures for Commonwealth grants. For government schools in 1994 it is estimated to be $1,073 million, and non-government schools receive approximately $1,563 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth grants represent approximately 12 per cent of the total spending on government schools with the rest being met by state governments while for non-government schools the Commonwealth provides approximately 37 per cent of total revenue with the remainder coming from other governments and other sources. Funding for government schools is based on yearly agreements with the states. Similar agreements are in place with non-government schools. The agreements require states and non-government schools to report annually to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1985, applications for government funding for new non-government schools and existing non-government schools that wish to change their operations have been determined according to the new schools policy. Under the new schools policy, applicants are to apply for funding to a new schools committee or a joint planning and coordination committee, depending on the state or territory, two years before funding is to commence. Late applications may be accepted in special circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is to determine the category in which the proposed school falls on the basis of a number of criteria such as the demographics of the school's catchment area, the planned provision of other schools in the area and the level of use of existing facilities. If the proposed school satisfies the relevant criteria it is to be given provisional approval for funding. Existing non-government schools in receipt of Commonwealth funds were required prior to 1993 to notify the relevant committee of all proposals to vary their operations. Notification was required two years before the proposed change, which had to be approved by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules were changed in 1993 so that some verification is allowed without assessment by a committee, although it must be notified of such changes six months before they come into effect. Variations covered by the new rules include changing from a single sex school to a co-educational school, or from a co-educational school to a single sex school; a change in status regarding whether the school is a day school, a boarding school or a combination of both; amalgamation with another funded school which does not involve a new level of education; or a relocation or separation of a school into two or more schools that do not involve a relocation. These points highlight the government's commitment to education. I am certainly very pleased to have the opportunity to reflect on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth mentioning this when we see the number of people going on to year 12. The member for Kennedy mentioned before that, when he was growing up as a young fellow, because he came from a more affluent family he was able to get a secondary education. I come from a similar sort of background&mdash;but it was not affluent, it was on the other side of things. We did not have the opportunity to get a good secondary education. I have been very proud to see this government encourage many young people to go on to year 12. I remember how my parents struggled so I could get at least half a secondary education. That was something my parents had a very strong commitment to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just before Christmas two of my sons received their degrees from university. We went to the graduation ceremony in Brisbane at the University of Queensland. We looked around the room to see the number of people there and thought about the backgrounds of those people. I saw a chap there with whom I use to work in the Bank of New South Wales. He was an English migrant to this country. He had struggled for most of his life and had come to this country to make a better life. His daughter and my son received their degrees, as did the grandson of a council truck driver. There were many people like that. I looked across and saw another elderly gentleman I knew, a retired coalminer from Ipswich, in my electorate. His granddaughter was receiving her degree, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look around and see young people receiving their degrees we can be really proud of the efforts of this government. It is something we should look very seriously at. We should commend the various Labor government ministers for education we have had since 1983; they have shown a very strong commitment to education. When we see, for instance, those people receiving their degrees in the crowded hall at the University of Queensland, as I highlighted, we can really see that a lot of this government's policies are working. I commend the ministers, and I take the opportunity in this place to put on record that their efforts are really paying off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People from all sorts of backgrounds are now receiving a good tertiary education. No longer is tertiary education available only to the rich. It is something we can all be very proud of because, at the end of the day, Australians will be much better off. Australia as a nation will be much better off through having a better educated work force. With changing technologies we must, if we are to employ our people, take advantage of every educational opportunity that is there, and I certainly encourage young people to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier the honourable member for Kennedy mentioned the banking sector and that he had a friend working for the Bank of New South Wales. I worked for the Bank of New South Wales, but he was not talking about me. In a sector such as banking we must have ongoing education. People need to get a better education as time goes on. As things changed in that sector, bank employees had to change as well; they had to take the opportunities to extend their own career options. I know from my own experience of that industry that when bank employees actually took the initiative and studied at night and were dedicated to improving their opportunities they did particularly well. I say, `Good on them'. They were prepared to give up their leisure time and lots of their weekends and evenings to spend studying so they could improve their lot in life, so good on them. Managing to obtain a better education has made them better people. That is progress; things move on. We have had to improve our education as we go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we just sit there and say, `She'll be right, mate', adopting the old attitude of those opposite that we all saw through the 1950s and 1960s when Australians sat back and said, `She'll be right; Mother England will look after us', then we know it won't happen that way. We have to help ourselves. As the honourable member for Kennedy mentioned, people in careers such as those in the banking industry have to get out and improve their qualifications if they want to achieve. Many of them have done it: good on them. I think we should acknowledge their contributions as well because the industry will only improve in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to turn to some aspects of the bill regarding the priority of languages. The priority of language incentive commenced in 1992. It provides funds to increase the number of students learning a priority language other than English. This too is an important area. For those of us who have the opportunity to travel from time to time&mdash;it is one of the things that we as members of parliament get the opportunity to do&mdash;it has really brought home to us that Australians, as isolated as we are, need to have at least a second language to communicate with people in other parts of the world. If we are to be a much more forward-looking nation we have to ensure that our people can speak other languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday morning when I returned home to my electorate I attended a school at Redbank to hand out school badges to the young people there. I was speaking to a grade seven teacher there who came from Holland and was able to speak seven languages. Certainly when he was living in Holland he had a greater advantage as he was only a couple of kilometres away from another country which had another language, but by being able to speak seven languages he has been able to move around. He actually taught in Italy at one stage. The benefits of that sort of an education are second to none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just speaking to someone like that in a little school in my own electorate emphasised to me the need for another language. I could see what great benefit it was to this particular teacher. When people have much greater opportunities to travel these days, it is important for them to learn a second language. Many of those points are highlighted in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority languages incentive element provides funds to increase the number of students actually learning a priority language other than English. In 1992, $5.4 million was paid under the program in respect of 18,149 students, a per capita rate of $300. The principal act allows the minister to determine a list of priority languages, currently 10, and allows the relevant state minister to determine that a maximum of eight of these languages is a priority language for grants to the state. If a state minister does not determine that a language is a priority language for the state, assistance is not available in respect of students of that language.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of languages are covered under the priority languages incentive element scheme. The languages that will be supported include Aboriginal languages, Arabic, French, German, Italian, modern Greek, Russian, Spanish, Thai and Vietnamese. That is a very important initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1992 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs tabled a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Language and culture&mdash;a matter of survival</EMPHASIS>, which was a report of the inquiry into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language maintenance. I had the privilege of chairing the subcommittee which delivered that report. Of course, the chairman of the full committee was the honourable member for Denison and now Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). It was quite an interesting experience for all those who were involved on the inquiry. The sad state of Aboriginal languages in Australia was highlighted during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill addresses some of those issues. I welcome that initiative. I am not sure whether the minister has actually picked up any of the committee's recommendations, but certainly some of the problems that we canvassed in the report are addressed in this bill. The executive summary of that report states:</PARA>

<PARA>That is pretty sad. Two hundred years ago there were probably 250 Aboriginal languages in this country; today there are only about 25. If we are going to maintain the language and culture of the Aboriginal people, we must make a greater effort to address this issue. However, I think that can be picked up in this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states also have a very important role to play in this process. Before coming in to speak on this bill this morning, I went through this report. We highlighted some of the problems. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee finds it intolerable that while most migrant children with a first language other than English have been able to study that language up to matriculation level, most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children cannot study their language at high school. As states and territories move to make LOTE compulsory the situation is exacerbated even further. Dr Schmidt cites as an example the NSW Education Department spending $3000 in 1989 for just one student to sit a Higher School Certificate exam in Estonian.</PARA>

<PARA>That is an indictment of the largest state in the Commonwealth of Australia. It actually admitted that to us. It is probably consistent with the policies of many other states&mdash;I am sure it is. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee formed the view that the New South Wales Education Department, while articulating its desire to support Aboriginal languages, had no serious intention of undertaking any specific program within the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA>That is atrocious. This was in 1992, so we are looking at beyond 2000. Those sorts of problems are highlighted in that report. The minister has not picked up this report, though I am sure the department has, at the minister's guidance. I would recommend that they come back to that report and look at some of the things we had to say about the need to preserve Aboriginal languages. It will help break down a lot of those barriers between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians if we can come to understand more about the quality of their languages. That is very important, and I just wanted to take the opportunity today to highlight that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill contains amendments to the funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, arising out of the government's response to the interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting by political parties</EMPHASIS> and out of further submissions made by the major political parties. The bill deals with changes to four aspects of the electoral funding provisions of our electoral laws. These are simplification of paper work, the method of payment of public funding entitlement to parties and candidates, an increase in that entitlement and provisions seeking to close loopholes in the disclosure provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for simplification of what the committee rightly saw as unnecessarily onerous reporting requirements for registered political parties. Parties will no longer have to report particulars of their financial transactions in the minute detail the legislation required. The recitation of this minutiae served no useful purpose in achieving the policy objectives underpinning the legislation. Those objectives are, of course, to force disclosure of donations to candidates or their parties that might appear to influence a parliamentarian or a political party's position in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the tens of thousands of small individual donations that are made at the time of elections do not fall into this category. The committee, in its wisdom, recommended higher thresholds before individual donations had to be included or highlighted in returns. The bill raises the threshold figure from $100 to $500 and nominates $1,500 as the sum at which donors must report and be reported. As the annual returns which political parties will be required to furnish under the proposed amendments will contain less detail than previously, the due date for furnishing them has been brought forward from 20 weeks to 16 weeks after the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the approach of simplifying procedures and avoiding unnecessary paperwork, parties will no longer be obliged to file a detailed election claim in the election year regurgitating financial information that will also be in their annual return. They will, however, have to lodge a return itemising major expenditure in respect of the election campaign. For some time now, parties have been complaining that payment of public funding has arrived long after the election. This was unavoidable in a system that required the parties to prepare highly detailed claims and lodge them and then have the AEC attend to the time consuming processing of hundreds of claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the political parties nor the AEC are overendowed with staff and the system placed great strain on their resources. The long gap between political parties and candidates running up campaign debts and receipt of funding has led to campaign directors seeking bank overdraft accommodation against the future payment of their entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The service charges on such overdrafts could be very heavy, particularly if there were problems in processing the return. That burden will now be substantially alleviated with the AEC making an interim payment of at least 95 per cent of the entitlement on the basis of the parties known vote by the third Friday after polling day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that point the House of Representatives count will be complete and the Senate close to completion. If certain proposals involving the provision of a computerised counting system for the Senate are implemented it is conceivable that the Senate count will also be completed by the last day that overseas postal votes enter the count. Otherwise the final payment could be slightly delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government holds the view that the public is entitled to know what is spent on election campaigns and the bill will reinstate the arrangement prior to 1992 when parties and candidates filed a return disclosing all significant expenditure such as broadcasting, publishing, printing, display advertising and opinion polls. </PARA>
<PARA>Payments to national offices</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also raises the possibility of payment to national offices. Until now, payment has been made to either state branches of parties, regional parties or individual candidates. This did not take into consideration the reality that some parties were structured on a national basis and may want to fund an Australia-wide election out of their national office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Registered parties will now be able to direct the AEC to pay their entitlement to the national office of a party. This can only be done by mutual agreement. Some state branches of parties may of course not wish to take this step. </PARA>
<PARA>Amount of funding</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill brings the funding rate for Senate elections into line with that for the House of Representatives and increases the election funding rate to $1.50 for each formal first preference vote, indexed each six months to rises in the CPI.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes will provide an estimated additional $14.656 million of public funding for registered political parties and entitled candidates, based on the payments made for the 1993 general election. The joint standing committee noted that it takes as much effort to win a Senate vote as one for the House of Representatives and this illogical distinction will be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increasing emphasis on disclosure has meant that donors are far more reluctant to contribute, given that the Australian public will now be aware of their commitment. The government and the committee take the view that the increase in funding is reasonable in the circumstances and a fair price to pay for a more transparent political process. </PARA>
<PARA>Donors' returns</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Donors to political parties were previously required to furnish returns following each election. This bill amends the reporting requirements of these donors to bring them into line with the reporting requirements of political parties by requiring annual returns to be furnished within 20 weeks after the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Closing loopholes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A loophole in the existing legislation which is addressed by this bill relates to the operation of trust funds and similar organisations&mdash;including companies&mdash;which function wholly or mainly for the benefit of a registered political party or a number of political parties. To appreciate the extent to which the disclosure provisions are being flouted one need only examine the latest returns of the opposition parties. The Liberal Party, for example, has revealed that it has received income of $7.2 million laundered through a trust called the Free Enterprise Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The donations to this foundation have not been disclosed to the AEC. One does not know whether all the income from this trust has gone to the Liberal Party but current yields on funds would suggest that the undisclosed donations could exceed $80 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To evade the disclosure provisions the National Party of Australia launders its donations through John McEwen House Pty Ltd, a corporation that provides income to the Nationals amounting to half a million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we heard of the South Australian Liberal receiving a $100,000 donation through an unregistered Hong Kong company. It has been suggested that the real source of these funds could be parties interested in bidding for a casino licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, the AEC's inability to police overseas donors represents a weakness in the legislation. I propose to give the joint standing committee a reference to advise how these provisions might be strengthened. Closing these loopholes has a lot of similarities to tackling tax evasion schemes. As one gate is shut, smart lawyers invent another. Nevertheless something has to be done to restore the spirit of our disclosure laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that trusts and related entities must provide annual returns to the Electoral Commission containing substantially the same information as parties are required to report. However, where an amount was paid to or for the benefit of one or more registered political parties from funds generated by capital of that entity, each person who contributed to the capital must be identified in the return. Following on from this is a provision which makes these entities subject to compliance investigations by officers authorised by the Australian Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another loophole has been addressed by providing that donations made to a person or body with the intention of benefiting a particular registered political party will be deemed to be donations directly to that party. The bill also addresses a concern expressed by some party agents about compliance investigations of local party units by providing that the registered party agent may attend such investigations or may nominate another person to attend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An anomaly in the act has been addressed by providing that the current registered agent of a political party may request that amendment be made to a claim or return. Previously, only the person who furnished the claim or return could make a request to the Electoral Commission that the claim or return be amended. For all those reasons, I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1995 amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act to give effect to recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The main elements in the bill include: making annual disclosure less complex, increasing the election funding rate, and bringing the Senate rate to the same level as the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1994, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters presented its interim report, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting by political parties</EMPHASIS>. It was a very important report because it was the first time since 1984, when the present government first introduced electoral funding into federal legislation, that the processes had been reviewed in some detail by an appropriate committee of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report flowed from the committee's resolution in May 1994 to take further evidence on the funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918. The proposals in the bill have been discussed between the parties and general agreement has been reached on most of the provisions contained therein. The coalition parties, of course, are opposed, as we have always been, to any retrospective elements in relation to contributions to the capital of trust funds which may generate income paid to a political party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this legislation amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and the amendments which it contains will have the effect of registered political parties not having to report minute details of financial transactions and annual returns. It might sound absurd but there was evidence before the committee to the effect that branches of the respective political parties literally had to keep an account of the number of Iced Vo Vos they bought for meetings over a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of intricate detail being sought was quite absurd for what is, essentially, a voluntary organisational structure used by various parties and administered by ordinary men and women in suburbs and country towns across Australia. To ask them to involve themselves in that level of detail, and to carry the onerous political and legal risks contained therein should an audit be conducted and the number of Iced Vo Vos registered be found to be incorrect, they were up for very serious fines under the legislation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I recall, there was an august Prime Minister from the Labor Party who had a great penchant for eating lamingtons&mdash;Mr Gough Whitlam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, other amendments contained in this legislation include that donors to registered political parties will report annually to the Australian Electoral Commission, to bring them in line with party reporting requirements. That is useful because it means that they can interrelate the need to report to the commission side by side with annual reporting processes necessary under the law and in compliance with the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments further provide that the agent of a registered political party will have a right to attend compliance investigations into local party units. Again, this was not previously required under the legislation. Consequently, an audit could be conducted of a branch's affairs but no-one was necessarily present to explain why there were more lamingtons or fewer lamingtons than were originally referred to in the costs of that particular branch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments further provide that organisations, such as trust funds, which are closely related to registered political parties will be required to furnish annual returns to the Australian Electoral Commission and will be required to detail the source of capital where income derived has been used wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party. An anomaly which prevents any person other than the person who furnished a claim or return from having that claim or return amended, will be removed to enable the current party agent to make the request for amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another two amendments which are worthy of note are that the rate for election funding reimbursement will be amended so that a Senate vote will be funded at the same rate as a House of Representatives vote and the rate will be increased to $1.50 per vote, indexed; and payments of election funding entitlements will also be able to be made to the national secretariat of a registered political party. That is with the agreement of the state body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should point out that this amendment is one which was amenable to the Labor Party because it has a centralised administrative system. This is not so for other parties&mdash;especially the Greens. I understand that the Australian Democrats argued quite persuasively that it had a state based organisational structure and, provided that there was agreement with the state bodies, the funding arrangements are as requested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation and its amendments will facilitate the completion of annual disclosure returns of income and expenditure by registered political parties by making them less complex. The point I made earlier is quite clear from the point of view of voluntary based organisations. Annual returns will no longer be required in great detail, as was the case under the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of donors of individual amounts of less than $500 need not now be disclosed. There are corresponding requirements in relation to payments. Again, that is a very significant amendment which will be of considerable help at the branch level. Donors of gifts of $500 or more, totalling more than $1,500, must be disclosed in an annual return of a political party. However, donors of gifts to a political party which total $1,500 or more during a financial year will be required to furnish an annual return. This will ensure that there is a cross-check of donations by having donors' returns cover the same time frame as party returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we see it, there is a retrospective element in the provision relating to annual returns of trust funds which will require details on the source of capital, even though that capital was contributed when there was no question of disclosure&mdash;in other words, under the old legislation. I understand that that matter will be further examined when the legislation is before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the amendments will enable a party agent to request that an amendment be made to a claim or return. That is the matter to which I earlier referred. The coalition does not intend to oppose this legislation, although I emphasise that we are strongly opposed to retrospective elements in relation to declaring the source of capital for trust funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I took some exception to the comments made by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) when he was trying to put forward the view that the coalition spent an inordinate amount of time trying to find loopholes in the old legislation, and suggesting, of course, that the Labor Party was absolutely above board and would never conceivably even think along such lines. The simple realities are that the Western Australian government was thrown out&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;over an interesting exercise called WA Inc. That was the case involving the activities of the Labor Party. A former premier is&mdash;or was&mdash;a guest in Her Majesty's gaol. A number of people have been before the courts, and possibly others will follow them. For the Labor Party to claim that it is somehow or other free of such activities&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was $1.6 million. John Curtin House is a very interesting little mechanism by which the Labor Party has been able to access property purchasers and use the rent gained therefrom as a means of supplementing its income. There is nothing illegal about that; I am not suggesting that there is. I am simply making the point that there are mechanisms which Labor has been only too happy to use over many years, certainly since 1984 when federal funding was first introduced, and which make it rather rich for the minister to seriously suggest that they are lilywhite and that everybody else is besmirched by allegations of this nature.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mainly in. Again this was a case where there were considerable questions raised by me and others as to whether the activities of the Commonwealth were being protected by the government in the context of its decision to rent out its accommodation, namely Centenary House, to the Commonwealth Auditor-General. I say here, as I have said in other places, we as a government would not have considered an arrangement such as that because it left open to considerable question whether the level of probity had been adequately met and whether the Auditor-General, of all people, was in a position to protect his integrity under those circumstances.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way this government can claim that it is lilywhite in these very complex issues of federal funding, or indirect federal funding, of political parties and it is a matter which is worth noting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also referred to the Free Enterprise Foundation. For the record may I make it absolutely clear that the Free Enterprise Foundation was established, as I understand it, in the early 1980s. It is not part of the Liberal Party, as the minister suggested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nevertheless, it is not part of the Liberal Party, unlike John Curtin House Ltd or the Centenary House arrangement where your ministerial colleagues have been, and  some possibly still are, directors of these companies which have been directly involved in funding the Labor Party, which is in government and which has had not the slightest compunction about leasing out at exorbitant rent its property to Commonwealth departments, including the Auditor-General. That is the issue. That is the question of probity which I am prepared to raise and debate in this House at any time with the minister or with anybody else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not come in here and try to put over an act that you are lilywhite because, frankly, a lot of people in the Australian community are highly suspicious of the activities of the Labor Party over recent years and the way in which you have used your power as the government of the day to enter into agreements which are clearly and unequivocally to the advantage of the Labor Party and certainly not to the advantage of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In any electoral funding legislation in Australia today we must balance the need to disclose properly where donations have come from to ensure that, wherever possible, benefits and assistance are not being given to people in exchange for contributions to political parties against, on the other hand, the very important need to ensure that the reporting conditions are not so onerous as to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to comply with the requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the legislation was first brought in by this government a number of years ago. As has been said by previous speakers, there has been a review of the procedures which have been in place until now and there has been a general consensus amongst the political parties in Australia that the way things were operating was simply not adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 has been brought into this place as a result of a report brought down by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and it amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act in a number of ways. On our side of politics we would have liked to have seen a number of other amendments made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in ways that would ensure that the result of an election in fact accurately represented the decision of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to financial matters, there are other matters which the government must address, and sooner rather than later. For instance, at the present time there is no need to prove identity to be able to enrol to vote. The Electoral Commission should trial a system of voter cards, there should be a continuous review of the electoral roll, subdivisional voting should be reintroduced and compulsory voting should be abolished. These are matters the government may well consider in the future but, unfortunately, they have not been included in the legislation currently before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular legislation will make a number of changes and, as a result, registered political parties will not have to report minute details of financial transactions in annual returns. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) outlined a number of the very minute transactions that he experienced had to be carried out within Liberal Party branches. I have even heard that, on occasions, a Liberal Party branch had been required to count the number of tea bags it held in stock&mdash;no doubt these rules also apply to the Labor Party. Clearly, the minute requirements for accounting, which have been in place until now, were an unintended consequence of the legislation. It is important, when one realises the system is not working the way it was intended to work, that amendments be brought in and, indeed, we are debating those amendments today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will also provide for donors to registered political parties to report annually to the Australian Electoral Commission so they can be brought into line with party reporting requirements. The provisions also include that an agent of a registered political party will have a right to attend compliance investigations into local party units, which is very important because these days the public image of a political party can quite often be determined by actions carried out at the local and branch level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it: the ALP has branch stacking. We have heard how the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rorted his first preselection. All that impacts on the Australian public's overall impression of the ALP. Similarly, if a local party organisation did not dot its i's and cross its t's as far as electoral financial matters were concerned, it could impact on the overall public impression of that political party. Therefore, it is eminently appropriate that the agent of a political party have the right to attend compliance investigations into local party units. When that is done, state office will have an idea of what is actually happening and will be able to rectify things that are not right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also provides that organisations, such as trust funds, which are closely related to registered political parties will be required to furnish annual returns to the Australian Electoral Commission and will be required to detail the source of capital where income derived has been used wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party. The legislation also seeks to remove an anomaly which prevents any person from having a claim or return amended other than the person who furnished it. That will be removed to enable the current party agent to make the request for amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rate of electoral funding and reimbursement will be amended so that a Senate vote will be funded at the same rate as a House of Representatives vote. The rate will be increased to $1.50 per vote and will be indexed. The coalition will not be opposing this. Payments of election funding entitlements will also be able to be made to the national secretariat of a registered political party with the consent of the state organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the principal changes occurring through the bill before the House. There has been a substantial public debate following the release by the joint committee of its recommendations, and thus we find ourselves today discussing legislation which will not be opposed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the Liberal and National parties was outlined by my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield when he addressed the parliament a short while ago. The coalition parties, however, are opposed to the retrospective element in relation to contributors to the capital of trust funds which generate income paid to a political party. As a general rule, our side of politics is certainly opposed to retrospective legislation which acts to the detriment of the citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, which has been some time in coming before the House of Representatives, is not being opposed by our side of politics. It is interesting to note that the government brought in this legislation for debate this morning without its appearing on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. I really wonder why we are discussing this piece of legislation when it has not appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Someone suggested to me that it could well be that the government has political motives in bringing it forward at this time. We all know how hard the government has tried to obtain a double dissolution trigger, but it has been denied such a trigger. Clearly, the government is keeping its options as open as possible so that it can go to the people at a time when it feels it could be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the current opinion polls, we see that the government is clearly on track to lose a vast number of seats. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has every chance, with the support of the Australian people, of becoming Prime Minister. In my view, he will be one of the greatest prime ministers that this nation has ever seen. I see that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) is smiling. Given the current opinion polls, I think the minister would consider his tenure as certainly limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I turn to the key points of this legislation. One provision will facilitate the completion of annual disclosure returns of income and expenditure by registered political parties by making them less complex. Annual returns will no longer require categorisation of amounts received and paid. Details of donors of individual amounts less than $500 need not now be disclosed. There are corresponding requirements in relation to payments. Donors of gifts of $500 or more totalling more than $1,500 must be disclosed in an annual return of a political party. However, donors of gifts to a political party which total $1,500 or more during a financial year must furnish an annual return, thereby ensuring that there is a cross-check of donations by having donors' returns cover the same time frame as party returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a retrospective element in the provisions relating to annual returns of trust funds which require details on the source of capital even though that capital was contributed when there was no question of disclosure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is not opposing the amendments moved by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should make one point in relation to amendment Nos 1 to 3 of clause 5, which relates to gifts to political parties. The minister is no doubt aware that this proposal will commence only on the date of agreement by the Governor-General. There is a real probability that that is going to be remarkably close to 30 June 1995, which is when the act is said to commence. Consequently, there could be an overlap problem, and that is worth serious consideration. There is no doubt the Electoral Commission will have to make sure all political parties are aware of the timing components in that particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to item 12, new division 5A, which removes the relevance of the time for claims to be made and lodged.

That, of course, is relevant to the coalition for obvious reasons. In many states, we have a joint ticket shared by both the Liberal Party and the National Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take great pleasure in speaking on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. This bill amends the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1992 to give effect to initiatives announced in last year's budget. Under this bill, $8.7 million will be provided by the Commonwealth in 1995 to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling, and $4 million will be provided in 1995 in grants to school authorities to support the study of 10 priority languages. This program will replace an existing program which supports eight languages in each state and territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill gives effect to changes to strengthen the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools and to simplify administrative arrangements for approving block grant authorities under the capital grants program for schools. It will also give effect to funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools for 1995, funding schedules for grants for community languages for 1995 and a revised funding schedule for grants for rural student hostel projects from 1994 to 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to provide grants to foster literacy development for children in the early years of schooling. As I have already said, under the new provisions $8.7 million will be made available to assist children from kindergarten to year 3, with special emphasis on those disadvantaged by low socio-economic backgrounds. That is entirely consistent with the government's social justice focus and the importance of access and equity to the most disadvantaged in the community for whom this government believes so strongly. Additionally, $4 million will be made available to provide grants to school authorities to support the study of the 10 priority languages that I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for a number of other changes, such as, strengthening the Commonwealth's new schools policy for funding new and changing non-government schools, simplifying administrative arrangements for approving block grant authorities and funding schedules for capital grants for government and non-government schools, which I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is one of the many important areas of social policy. It is about social justice and access and equity to Australia's young people, which is the reason the government places a high priority in getting the balance right and in social justice in education. Education is one of a number of policy areas which suffer from an unfortunate circumstance: under the constitution it is primarily a state government responsibility. Because the federal government provides a large amount of money to education, the funding of schools and vocational education is subject to Commonwealth-state agreements and relies on cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states, which is not always forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) pointed out in his speech, the federal government provides over $3 billion each year to Australia's schools. Yesterday in question time I asked a question of the minister relating to the Grants Commission report. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Free" NAMEID="HG4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a good question. The answer he gave the House was certainly enlightening. I will elaborate on some of the current circumstances facing the school education system in New South Wales. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Victorian per capita funding on government education was $511 which, for the first time this decade, was below New South Wales per capita funding, which was $512. However, on a per student basis, New South Wales is still last.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to the comments the minister made yesterday because they are enlightening and fairly revealing about the New South Wales government's commitment to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has outlined, 33 new government schools were opened in New South Wales last year. Only 10 schools were opened before 30 June. Obviously, in the second half of the year, the New South Wales government decided that an election was coming up and it had better get on with the opening of a few schools. These projects, funded either wholly or partially by the Commonwealth, totalled $47,098,000 in 1994. Of that, $27,255,000 was funded by the Commonwealth, or 57.87 per cent of the total cost of these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a bit of a history in all states of state governments being pretty opportunistic in the way they take the electoral credit by taking every opportunity to open these schools with a lot of fanfare so guidelines have been put in place whereby, depending on the ratio of funding between the Commonwealth and the state, the Commonwealth government or the state government has opening rights or, in some cases, there are joint opening rights. As part of the guidelines for Commonwealth funding for these schools and TAFEs there is certainly a requirement for the federal minister or his representative to be able to address these functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system used by the New South Wales government to notify the Commonwealth of the dates of these openings technically breaches the guidelines. In 1994, it technically breached the guidelines in 100 per cent of cases. So, last year, every time a school was opened in New South Wales the New South Wales government breached the agreement with the Commonwealth on the protocol for these openings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure used is that the New South Wales government notifies the minister's office of a date and will rarely change that date, even if it is unsuitable&mdash;for example, if federal parliament is sitting and the minister cannot get there. If federal members cannot get there, the New South Wales government still refuses to change the date even though in most cases there is more Commonwealth funding than New South Wales government funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes the regional officers of the Department of Education in New South Wales set the date but the New South Wales government will still not change the date if it is unsuitable for the Commonwealth minister or federal members. In at least one instance this date has been unsuitable but an alternative date was not negotiated by the region or by the office of the state minister. Some examples are Gosford High School, Sydney Boys High School and Birchgrove Primary School, where the openings clashed with sitting dates of federal parliament. For some reason, the New South Wales government and its education department were not prepared to cooperate to enable the Commonwealth to be represented by an elected person. Four of these openings out of the 33 in New South Wales last year did clash with federal parliamentary sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what has happened in 1995. I mentioned that only 33 schools were opened in New South Wales for the whole of 1994, 23 of which were in the second half of the year. But this year by 25 March 1995, 45 government schools will have been opened in New South Wales. This compares with only one government school being opened in February or March in 1994. These 45 schools, as was the case with last year's schools, were funded wholly or in part by the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total cost of these school projects was $116,931,106. The Commonwealth government contributed $73,302,432 or approximately 63 per cent of the total cost of those 45 schools. Funding for TAFE colleges was a total of $61,835,710, to which the Commonwealth contributed $55,859,710. The total is $129 million-odd of Commonwealth funding out of a total of $178.7 million for schools and TAFEs in New South Wales that have been opened or will be opened in February and March. That is a total of about 72 per cent of Commonwealth funding for these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, the system used by the New South Wales government to notify the Commonwealth of these openings has breached the guidelines in every single case. The New South Wales government notified our minister's office of the date, giving in most cases less than the required two months notice that is required under the Commonwealth-state agreement. Despite an approach by the minister to the New South Wales minister, Virginia Chadwick, in early January this year, the minister has refused to change any of the unsuitable dates. In fact, she did not even bother to answer the letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister gave some examples yesterday of schools around New South Wales. I will mention some of them. The Lucas Heights Community School was officially opened on 2 February after having operated for more than two years. A school called the Portland Central School had some new classrooms and an administration block opened yesterday, even though the work on it will not finish until May. Nevertheless, it was opened yesterday, just in time for the state election, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is to be an opening staged shortly at Lidcombe TAFE, obviously in the next two weeks. The buildings have not yet been finished, not even to the extent that a plaque can be put up. As the building could not be opened, it was decided to have a tree planting instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three other very interesting cases, all of which are in the state electorate of the South Coast and the federal electorate of Gilmore&mdash;Sanctuary Point, Vincentia High and St Georges Basin Public School. I understand that the state member for the South Coast, John Hatton, the Independent, who recently announced he would not be contesting the state election, was originally invited. Lo and behold, as soon as he announced he would not be standing for the forthcoming state election he was suddenly disinvited and Premier John Fahey decided he would do the opening instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) discovered by talking to some state education officials that he was not going to be invited or he was not going to be allowed to speak at these openings. Naturally he took umbrage at that, given that he had sought special permission and was fortunate enough to be granted leave from this place to attend. There was a fairly major bike race he had been instrumental in organising taking place last Monday, and he found&mdash;in the case of the three schools and the bike race he had organised&mdash;that Premier John Fahey did not want him anywhere near these events, let alone speaking at them. So he contacted the Premier's office and left a fairly concise and forthright message about the fact that he had not been invited. The Premier denied that there was any attempt to remove him from the speaking list at these three schools and the bike race. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premier obviously had been caught out. He did not want to be seen as the petty Premier of New South Wales that he indeed is. When the honourable member turned up at these events he found that his name had been removed from the speaking list; nevertheless, he was able to speak anyway as commonsense prevailed. This is a classic example of politics in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked to represent the federal minister at the opening of some buildings at the Campbelltown Performing Arts High School yesterday. Unfortunately, because of the business of this place, I and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) were unable to obtain leave to attend. The school is in the seat of Werriwa, but the catchment area for this school&mdash;a very important performing arts high school in Campbelltown&mdash;takes in both the seats of Macarthur and Werriwa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because there has been a deliberate policy on the part of the New South Wales minister to open as many of these schools as she can get away with during federal parliamentary sitting weeks, despite the fact that there is so much Commonwealth money involved, unfortunately there was no elected federal government representative able to be present. The state member for Campbelltown, who happens to be a member of the Labor Party, Mr Michael Knight, was there but he was not afforded the opportunity to speak. My wife attended in my place but was not able to speak. Funnily enough, the minister for education, Virginia Chadwick, could not be bothered attending either. She was off around the countryside in some other marginal seat opening another school&mdash;probably the one at Lithgow in the electorate of the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons)&mdash;with federal government money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Campbelltown Performing Arts High School the Commonwealth contribution was 100 per cent. It was funded 100 per cent by Commonwealth funding&mdash;$446,000. The New South Wales government contributed not one cent to that education facility&mdash;not one cent to the future of young children interested in the performing arts who attend that particular first-rate high school. Nevertheless, the New South Wales government trotted out not the minister, as I said, but a parliamentary secretary from the upper house who nobody had heard of&mdash;Richard Bull&mdash;the same person the New South Wales government trotted out to open the schools in Gilmore on Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I understand, the parliamentary secretary, Richard Bull, spoke a lot of bull when he opened the school yesterday. He did not even mention the Commonwealth government's contribution to the school. Despite the fact that it was 100 per cent Commonwealth money, he did not even mention that. He, of course, talked about the New South Wales government's supposed great commitment to education. We heard about that yesterday. The New South Wales government is coming last in terms of funding per student. It is $250 per student behind the national average, I think that is right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I obviously support very strongly the allocation of additional funds to education in Australia, particularly in the primary and secondary areas. Also, I would like to commend the shadow minister, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), for his contribution to this debate and his concern, as reflected in his amendment, that the funding policies of federal government should take account of all of the real and relevant issues that contemporary Australians want to see addressed. I also give recognition to the role of both state and non-government schools in the education system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to provide a perspective from the point of view of a country member of parliament. I am a member from regional Australia. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, my seat is in north-east Victoria. We have many dynamic and interesting school communities in north-east Victoria. Some of them are in the large cities such as Wodonga, Wangaratta, Benalla and Yarrawonga and others are in very small communities. We also have populations, in both the non-government and the government education areas, that extend into catchments where people have to travel fairly long distances to and from school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases, there are interstate arrangements. For example, in Corryong in the upper Murray near Mount Kosciusko, the schools have traditionally provided educational opportunities in primary and secondary schools, and now in TAFE, for students from New South Wales travelling each day across the state border. That is also the case along the Murray River. You will find many examples of school communities actually serving catchments in both states. That is as it should be. I, for one, believe that education knows no state borders, nor should it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is a national asset and resource. We require and must demand of all of our people in charge of education in the political arena both in state and federal governments, and also in the management area, that there be the maximum of cooperation and assistance. At the same time, I think competition is a very healthy thing. I believe the opportunity for school communities to be innovative and to provide their own subjects in a general sense is a very good thing and should be encouraged, as it enriches the education framework that is needed for our young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to also thank the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), for his courtesy to me and to schools in my electorate in the many ways that he has helped the schools develop. In the near future, I will have the honour of representing the minister as a federal member of parliament in the opening of some extensions at the Mitchell secondary college in Wodonga, which used to be a technical school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was on the school council many years ago, and one of my children attended the Mitchell college to do what was then called TOP, which was a version of VCE. If you are trying to keep up with all of these titles, I am sure that you would be as dismayed as I am in trying to keep up with the various changes in education. I am very pleased that the minister has been gracious enough to ask me to represent him. I will do my best to make sure that the contribution of both state and federal governments, on behalf of taxpayers, is acknowledged fairly and in an even-handed way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> However, I want to make some comments that I hope will be regarded as constructive comments, but they are serious ones that need to be addressed, in relation to planning the allocation of the valuable and scarce dollars that we have for education in Australia. In country areas particularly, parents who have children with disabilities have a special burden to bear. They do not, in every case, have access to the larger facilities that are available for children needing special teaching and assistance because they live in smaller communities separated from the larger cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one example which I will give in a general sense without identifying the family so as not to embarrass it. In a Catholic school in Myrtleford there is a marvellous sister who, with her staff and the parents of a child with a profound hearing problem, has been able to make a remarkable contribution to the educational development of a particular little girl. As a result of the efforts and assistance of both Commonwealth and state education departments, the little girl's educational progress has been quite remarkable. She is, in fact, able to attend a normal, ordinary school in Myrtleford and, despite her profound hearing disability, is making good progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has only been made possible because an interpreter is available on a one-to-one basis for quite a lot of the school week to assist this child and the teachers to relate and for the child to participate in education. Honourable members should remember that, by reason of this sort of arrangement, the benefits are, firstly, that the child is able to stay in a normal family environment, living with mother and father in the country community and not having to go away to some distant part, separated from her parents. That is a bonus, and I do not have to explain the reason why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it helps the school community understand and assist in the assimilation of children with disabilities. One of the greatest examples you can ever find of how successful it is to have children with disabilities in school communities is to see how children who do not have disabilities, who are going through school with these children&mdash;their mates&mdash;do not find any difference at all in their colleagues' position, even though in many cases they are profoundly disabled. It is great to see that manifestation, that development of understanding. The eventual erosion of discrimination against people with disabilities will come about because of the example being set in these circumstances and the way in which young Australians accept children in their school environment with disabilities as being just the same as they are. We should do all we can to encourage the continuation and development of these sorts of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case that I am mentioning, the small amount of money that is required to pay for the interpreter services will not be available to the same extent for this child's continuing education in secondary schooling in Myrtleford. The reason is somewhat complicated. It is partly because the Catholic Education Office has to allocate its scarce resources amongst all these schools that need assistance in this area and the inability of the state and federal governments to provide additional funds to cope with all of the requests from the Catholic Education Office and other government schools in Victoria and the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not attacking or criticising anyone in this system. As a former minister, I know the burden of trying to prioritise and do the right thing when there is not enough money to go round. It is a very difficult circumstance. I am raising this case because I was struck by the fact that, if the one-to-one interpreter is not available to help continue with this child's educational development, it will have a dramatic adverse effect on this child's future and disrupt the child and her family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the allocation of money in this bill that will occur in language development in improving literacy development, perhaps it would be appropriate for us to be a bit more flexible and to look again at the way the programs are funded to see whether we can squeeze a few more dollars into helping children of the type that I have just described to go on, develop and achieve their full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is often the case, education is the bridge to understanding, success and happiness. I believe&mdash;I am sure the minister will agree with me&mdash;that children with disabilities should be given that special leg-up, if possible, through education. The education process can be a marvellous way of helping disabled people make their way in life and succeed. We have many friends with serious disabilities who are outstanding in their contribution to society and to business and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that to members because I think it is worth reflecting on. I am going to write to the minister and give him more information about this case to see whether we could do a case study and do something to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other measure I would like to welcome is the increased effort to improve literacy standards in schooling. It is easy to criticise and to pass on stories that members of parliament collect as they travel around their electorates, but we all know that many people&mdash;in business, commerce and industry&mdash;complain and express alarm about the lack of skill in the basics of many of those who have left secondary school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I am alarmed that this is the case. It is a difficult problem because often it implies an adverse criticism that is not fair on many fine teachers who have done their best. However, I think there is ample evidence, as the funding in this bill obviously recognises, that a lot more needs to be done to improve the basic skills in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a brother who is a primary school teacher. I believe, notwithstanding his constant brainwashing of me constantly over many years, that it is at the primary school level that we should be putting in a lot more resources and effort to increase the skills of and teaching opportunities for children in those basic areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, is it not a remarkable thing that Australia is suddenly waking up to itself about the need to skill our young children in other languages? I was told recently that parents in Japan are no longer seeking to have their children taught English as a second language. They are very pragmatic and their preference now is for the Cantonese language. We can well understand why, with a market of more than 1,000 million people right on their doorstep. With the knowledge that in future the world will very much involve China in the activities of every other country, especially those in Asia, it is understandable that parents in Japan would like their children to be able to converse in a skilled way in a language that the Chinese use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, despite the fact that we are very close to Indonesia and other Asian countries, recognition of the need for our students to be given the opportunity to learn a second language&mdash;in my view, preferably an Asian language&mdash;has been a very slow and painful process. I for one would advocate that there be a compulsory second language introduced into the curriculum at primary school level and that that compulsory language be one of the Asian languages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that might offend some of my friends who have a closer affinity to the classical languages of Europe. But I say quite pragmatically that we should require our children to have a compulsory Asian language included in their curriculum. Just as reading, writing and 'rithmetic training is supposed to be carried out at primary level, so should an Asian language be included. I will be watching with great interest the development of the new 10 priority languages program to be funded in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent many people in Albury-Wodonga area who are in the defence forces. There is a very large defence establishment there. I would like to mention how frustrating it has been for parents involved in the defence industry, having to move around the country and around the world in the course of their careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know persons in the army who have had as many as 18 transfers in their careers. There are not as many transfers now because there have been changes, but there are still quite a few. It is a great burden for parents and teachers to have to put up with some of the idiosyncrasies in the basic curriculum between states. I know that the state and federal ministers have been working on this and have made a lot of progress in reaching recognition and uniformity in some of these basic areas. However, a lot more work has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents who are employed in the defence area would like the federal and state education ministers to give absolute priority to resolving this matter in a way that reflects the needs of contemporary defence force families in Australia. This applies to other people who have to move around the country because of their jobs in this economy which is becoming more dynamic. Nowadays, people do not have just one job when they leave school; they sometimes have three or four or five careers. We have to get used to the idea that there will be a lot more mobility in Australia as people move from place to place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the funds will soon be flowing. I hope that the openings will be many.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also enjoyed the contributions from the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). It is the contribution of the honourable member for Ballarat on which I would like to concentrate. It will come as no surprise to the honourable member for Ballarat to learn that the government rejects his amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his remarks he raised three matters that deserve some attention: the first concerns retention rates; the second concerns supplementation; and the third concerns the review of the new schools policy. I turn first of all to retention rates. It is true that retention rates grew steadily from the early 1980s. They were around 36 per cent when the honourable member for Ballarat's party left office and they reached their peak of 77.1 per cent in 1992. There was a slight decline in 1993 to 76.6 per cent and a sharper decline last year to 74.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the large number of alternative routes to employment now available to young people, year 12 retention rates do not provide a complete picture of where our young people are gaining relevant education and training. Certainly there is an improvement in the labour market. I imagine that the figures for February, which will be released at about this time, will show continuing growth in opportunities for young people&mdash;as they have in recent months. That is resulting in more young people taking up apprenticeships and other employment options. That trend is confirmed in figures showing apprenticeship commencements increasing from 26,800 in 1993 to 33,000 last year and a corresponding drop in the 15- to 19-year old unemployment rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that fewer young people appear to be repeating year 12, responding to advice from the government, repeated by me on a number of occasions, that repeating year 12 is unlikely to produce the kind of improvement in results that some year 12 repeaters seem to be expecting. Fewer young people are repeating year 12; instead, they are taking up opportunities in TAFE and employment, as the government has been encouraging them to do. This has also had an effect on school retention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A technical factor which would be of interest to the honourable member for Ballarat is that more young people these days are choosing to study year 12 on a part-time rather than a full-time basis and those students are not counted by the ABS for retention purposes if they are studying part time. The patterns are interesting on a state by state basis. In Victoria, for example, between 1992 and 1994 retention fell by 3.8 per cent as opposed to a national fall of 2.5 per cent. As I mentioned yesterday, New South Wales has the lowest retention rate of any mainland state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a reasonable illustration of Liberal policy in action. This is a reasonable illustration of what would happen were the policies advanced by the honourable member for Ballarat put in action. As a result, in those two Liberal states you see that very poor performance. In his own state, his colleagues in state government having closed 271 government schools and sacked over 8,000 teachers, it is not surprising that one should see falls of the kind I have mentioned in school retention. It is reasonably difficult to expect young people to continue on at school if at the same time you are closing their schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of supplementation, which the honourable member raised, it is true that the government considered this matter very carefully, as it well might, given that the index of average government school recurrent cost rose by 5.1 per cent in the most recent period. That required a considerable amount of money to supplement school funding, some $133 million this year. The government did consider its position very carefully because the original intention of the policy to index schools funding by average government school recurrent cost was intended to link quality improvements from the government sector to the flow of funds to schools in general and to the non-government sector in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A figure of 5.1 per cent at a time when inflation was very low at 1.7 per cent obviously provided food for thought for the government, particularly given that the most significant contributing factor to the 5.1 per cent increase in costs was a blow-out in Victoria. That was the year in which the Victorian government sacked those teachers and paid out around $180 million in redundancy payments. The Commonwealth found it fairly difficult to accept that an increase in expenditure that involved sacking teachers could be linked to a quality index, which was the point of the original policy. The Commonwealth took time to consider its position and it decided that the original undertaking would stand and, as a result, many schools in all sectors will this year get the benefit of that additional $133 million in supplementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Ballarat spent some time on the government's decision to undertake a review of the new schools policy in the non-government sector. This review signals, first of all, a continuing commitment by this government to the orderly development of viable non-government schools. It also provides us with the opportunity for a comprehensive review of a policy which is almost 10 years old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very rare&mdash;the honourable member for Ballarat may not be aware of this&mdash;for a policy to be in place for that long and not be subject to a review, particularly a program of this size that has been operating for almost 10 years and involving expenditure of well over $1 1/2 billion in the non-government sector. While the policy has undergone some changes over that period, it has certainly not been subject to any in-depth examination of its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review is certainly timely because the last 10 years have seen major changes in the school education environment. I have mentioned that year 12 retention rates have more than doubled, so the school population in the post-compulsory years is very different in 1995 from the position a decade ago. Schools these days are increasingly becoming providers of vocational education, information technology is also having its impact, and other interesting structural developments are appearing. For example, there are developments which promote links between the various sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Coffs Harbour an education precinct was recently opened which involves the co-location of a campus of the Southern Cross University, a TAFE college and a government high school, sharing facilities and promoting movement between the sectors. A similar kind of development is planned for the site of the former HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> in Sydney, which again will involve a campus of a university, a large TAFE presence, a government secondary school and a Catholic secondary school, to allow for the opportunity to share resources and generally an enriched educational environment. As well, there are examples around the country of links between the systems. For example, at Golden Grove in South Australia we have co-located a government high school, a Catholic high school and a Uniting Church high school, which are sharing some specialist facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unreasonable to say that we ought to look at the new schools policy and see whether it promotes these kinds of developments as well as it might and see whether changes are needed. There certainly has been a high level of interest in the review amongst stakeholders from a variety of quarters. It will provide stakeholders with an opportunity to discuss issues concerning new schools which they have raised from time to time&mdash;for example, whether the minimum enrolment requirement ought to take into account where a school is located and whether the same minimum enrolment requirements should apply in rural and remote areas as apply in the capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review could provide a view on whether the policy is flexible enough to take into account the benefits that can flow from a whole range of developments that people really were not thinking about 10 years ago. It is in that spirit&mdash;and, frankly, underpinned by my basic belief that the new schools policy has served the country well but that now is the time to look at ways in which we might be able to make it work better&mdash;that the review will proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice from his press release of Tuesday that the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Ballarat, wants to scrap the new schools policy altogether. The opposition believes in providing funding for every new non-government school which opens, regardless of its prospects for future viability and regardless of its impact on existing schools in the region. One really has to question whether the position adopted by the opposition is a sensible use of education dollars, given that they are the same people who have accused this government from time to time of waste and duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say to the honourable member for Ballarat that I have found no significant stakeholders in the education area who agree with the position he has adopted. Why should they? They would be faced with a position where non-government schools would come and go in the free market world of coalition education policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could then reasonably ask, `What happens to the students attending a school which does not offer a sufficient range of subjects, becomes non-viable and then closes?' It is an interesting approach by the opposition. The opposition has frequently been accused of lacking policy&mdash;that side being a policy free zone. On a number of occasions I have criticised the honourable member for Ballarat and his predecessors for their lack of policy. On this occasion, I have to admit that I am wrong. They have a policy in this area. Their policy is that they will not have a policy. They want to abolish the new schools policy altogether. I hope the honourable member for Ballarat will make a submission to the inquiry if he feels so moved. Perhaps opposition members are finding it a little too hard. Perhaps they are finding that the challenges presented by the changing educational environment which I have described are too demanding to be able to frame a coherent approach aimed at providing quality education for all Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Ballarat accused the government of strangling growth in the non-government sector. I think he ought to be aware that in this year, in 1995,  there are around 2,500 non-government schools in this country and that over the decade the share of total enrolments in the non-government sector has increased from 25.8 per cent in 1985 to 28.5 per cent in 1994. This growth in enrolments is hardly indicative of a policy which is strangling growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Ballarat is terribly interested about the timing of the review. I can tell him that the review will have sufficient time to do its job properly and to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to make submissions and be consulted in the progress of the review. I will certainly not be instructing the review to hasten its work. It is an important review of a policy which has been in place for almost 10 years. If the member for Ballarat thinks that he can dictate the review timetable and rush its work, he will be sadly mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In closing I should say something about literacy, because the honourable member for Ballarat did. It is true that the government through this bill is devoting additional resources to early literacy and that it has been very pro-active in the field over the years with a great deal of success. I would be the first to admit that the work we have done in literacy has not been completely successful. It is impossible to ever say that. Certainly in the case of the honourable member for Ballarat it has been less than a complete success. I note that his press release of Tuesday still has punctuation errors, although there are fewer than in early releases. He should be very careful of where he puts the apostrophe in the word `its'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments relate to grants to the states. I need to bring the attention of the House to a matter that occurred yesterday and which should be of enormous concern to this House. It is in relation to a response from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) to a question by the member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland). I will be interested to hear the minister's comments on what I am about to say. I assume he will follow with an apology to this House and to the Victorian government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the member for Macarthur's question yesterday about state funding in Victoria, the minister stated that Victoria's spending was well below the per student Australian average. The minister is obviously unaware of the difference between per capita and per student. To malign the Victorian government in the way he has done in relation to its spending was a total misrepresentation of the facts. The $538 that the minister referred to was indeed the standardised average, the per capita average, for Australia. It bore no relation to per student spending and therefore the minister's allegation that the Victorian government had reduced its per student funding to schools and was now at the bottom of the pile is totally incorrect and a gross misrepresentation of the true position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the true situation in relation to per capita funding and use the minister's figure of $538. He was using it per student but it is a per capita figure. If we look at the true standardised figures we will see that Victoria is spending well above its standardised per capita amount, according to the Grants Commission. This matter was raised in the Victorian state parliament yesterday. I will read briefly from the speech, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially what the commission does is to establish a standardised expenditure for education for the various states. In doing that the commission takes into consideration a number of factors. So far as Victoria is concerned it takes into consideration, for example, that it is geographically smaller and more densely populated than other states and has fewer problems with remoteness and isolation, its established infrastructure and the age distribution of its population. On that basis the commission's report shows that Victoria's actual spending per capita is $511.18 and the commission's standardised expenditure for Victoria is $476.86.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear indication that, according to the Grants Commission, the Victorian government is spending more on education than the commission believes it should be. The minister misrepresented the position in this House yesterday. I hope he will apologise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;This occasion marks the closure of the second reading debate on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994, and it follows the referral of the bill to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on 8 February of this year. The government thanks the members of the committee for producing a report on the bill in such a timely fashion. Together with the committee, the government acknowledges the efforts of all those who provided submissions to the committee or appeared before it. The committee report deals with a number of concerns about specific provisions which have been raised in the parliamentary debate on the bill or in submissions to the committee. I now table the government's response to the committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these brief remarks, I will just mention two of the main issues arising from the report: the distinction between small and large proprietary companies, and the question of access to debenture registers. One of the key reforms in the bill is to reduce the financial reporting requirements of small proprietary companies. The bill makes the distinction between small and large companies for this purpose by using a three-part objective test which looks at assets, revenue and employees. The committee concluded that, on balance, it preferred the small and large test, as a basis for distinguishing between proprietary companies, to the reporting entity concept advanced by the accounting bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that serious consideration be given to two options: namely, that the employees criteria remain, or that the employees test be deleted from the bill and the test for a small or large proprietary company be on the proposed assets and turnover criteria alone. The current test in the bill is designed to achieve an approximate measure of the company's economic significance. It provides a measure of flexibility which enables the test to be targeted in a manner which seems to the government to be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the bill were to be amended to rely on two criteria alone, it would become a less appropriate test of a company's economic significance and, accordingly, a less appropriate touchstone for the application of corporate financial reporting requirements. Having said that, I advise that the government has noted carefully the committee's comments on these criteria and will keep them under review. If the employees criteria proves to be inappropriate in practice, the government will certainly be prepared to re-examine the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains important new safeguards to protect the privacy of debenture holders and of other securities holders whose details are shown in registers. The committee provided a full opportunity for both the representatives of the Australian Finance Conference and members of the simplification task force to discuss the rules in the bill on debenture registers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has not proposed any change to the new protections included in the bill. However, it has recommended that an additional provision should be inserted to give the ASC the same power of exemption as it presently has. The government acknowledges that there are points to be made&mdash;both for and against&mdash;providing additional restrictions on access to debenture registers, but it has decided to accept the committee's view that the ASC should be able to provide such restrictions as it might consider necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all members who contributed to this debate. The debate was actually conducted some weeks ago in the House, and the matter was then referred to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The committee report was a useful addition to the debate. I thank everyone involved. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill is important legislation.

<PARA>The first two proposed amendments concern schedule 6 of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994, which provides for the introduction of the concept of penalty units into the Corporations Law. Due to unexpected delays in the passage of state legislation concerning other unrelated matters in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994, it has not been possible to commence schedule 6 of that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed to amend the commencement provisions of schedule 6 by amending subsection 2(2) of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994. Schedule 6 will now commence on the day on which the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill receives royal assent. Because the bill contains a number of penalties which are expressed in terms of penalty units, the government considers it necessary to amend the Corporations Amendment Legislation Act in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third proposed amendment to the bill arises because of a changed section reference in the law. The Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1994 has amended a section reference in the Corporations Law. For this reason, one of the references in the simplification bill is now incorrect. The third proposed amendment will correct it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we are considering all the amendments together, let me say that, in relation to the work that was undertaken by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities on the Corporate Law Simplification Bill, the opposition believes that the work that has been done and the amendments that have resulted demonstrate the virtue of having the opportunity to examine important bills of this character. Matters of very real concern were raised by a number of members on this side of the House who have spoken on the bill. As I have said on a number of occasions, it is important to recognise that it is the Senate that has undoubtedly pioneered work in relation to deliberating on legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that there are more occasions on which the committees of the House ought to be used for such purposes. The government ought to facilitate and accommodate the reference of matters to committees of this House. It not only enhances the outcome but also ensures that there does not develop a view that the only people around this place who are able to add useful comments to and improve bills are senators. I think it is in the interests of members of the House of Representatives to be able to make those contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, of course, it is the work of a joint committee, involving both senators and members of the House of Representatives. I think the value of it can be seen in the fact that the government has accepted a number of the amendments suggested by that committee, in addition to a number of its technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go to the matter that we are discussing&mdash;the matter of the reporting entity test versus the test proposed in the bill&mdash;the distinction between small and large proprietary companies which will replace the current distinction between exempt and non-exempt companies was the subject of some public comment while the bill was being considered. The Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of CPAs came out strongly in favour of the reporting entity test. On balance, the committee concluded that the test proposed in the bill should be adopted, as the reporting entity test does not provide a test of sufficient certainty. The committee was further advised that the distinction made by the bill reflects overseas practice and experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a question as to whether the criteria proposed in the bill for distinguishing between small and large companies should be adopted in whole or in part. The test proposes that a company move from a small company to large company when it meets two of the following three criteria: more than 50 employees; gross operating revenue of more than $10 million; or assets of more than $5 million. The committee considered that tests of assets and turnover were more important than tests in relation to number of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee was not able to reach an unqualified view on the test, and believes the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) should give serious consideration to whether the 50 employees criteria should be kept or should be deleted, leaving only the tests on assets and turnover, the government, in its response, indicated that it saw the present proposal as being sufficiently flexible to ensure that the test was targeted in a manner which, to the government, seemed to be appropriate. But the government made it quite clear, in the Attorney-General's report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having said that, the Government has noted carefully the committee's comments on these criteria and will keep them under review. If the employees criteria proves to be inappropriate in practice, the Government will certainly be prepared to re-examine the issue.</PARA>
<PARA>We welcome that commitment. I have mentioned it because we see it as a genuine commitment on the government's part and, if that further examination were required, we would expect that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the other matters, the only important issue that I would like to advert to is the issue of having the register of debenture holders made public. It was a matter that caused some controversy and debate. Privacy is important.

The committee looked at the distinction between small and large proprietary companies and came to the view that on balance the small-large test was a more appropriate and certain test than the reporting entity test, and resolved on balance that two of the three criteria in the bill ought to be adopted as a test. The Attorney-General has indicated that he proposes to stick with that provision which was the on-balance view of the committee. I think that is right for the reason he points out: that test goes to a company's economic significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the Attorney-General has indicated that he has undertaken to keep those criteria under review and has acknowledged the government's preparedness to re-examine the issue if such reconsideration should become necessary. As far as the debenture registers amendment is concerned, the Attorney-General has picked up the recommendation of the committee, and the committee would certainly welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other issues which the committee dealt with was the question of the number of shareholders and directors in a proprietary company. The committee's recommendation is that the law should enable proprietary companies to be formed with one director. I say that is good for small business and good for women because it will get over the age-old problem of the difficulty caused by active and passive directors and the issue of sexually transmitted debt, as it has become known, where more often than not the passive director is a spouse or a woman who takes no active involvement in the running of a company, simply signs the accounts, and if all goes wrong&mdash;as occasionally it does&mdash;is left saddled with the debts of the company. So this bill should avoid that occurring in the future and cut that problem off at source. The Attorney-General has indicated that he believes that change will be widely applauded by the small business community, as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the auditors of proprietary companies are concerned, another issue raised by the committee, the Attorney-General has indicated that he is pleased to ensure that the working party on simplification and audit gives this issue careful consideration. As far as the incorporation of the proposed small business guide into the bill is concerned, again the committee resolved on balance that that ought to remain part of the law as proposed by the bill. There were some reservations, but in this respect I am in the Attorney-General's camp. I think he is right in stating that legislators ought to be innovative from time to time, but I am also pleased to see that he has picked up the recommendation of the committee that because it is innovative it is an issue that ought to be reviewed, and he has certainly given that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also dealt with the question of the ASC's power to require the preparation of financial reports by small companies. The Attorney-General has picked up this particular recommendation and indicated that he is raising it with the chairman of the ASC for a formal response. As chairman of the committee, I know that my personal attitude will not necessarily be shared by all members of the committee. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has made clear his view on whether proprietary companies ought to be able to be formed with one director, so I am sure the Attorney-General's response will not satisfy him, but as chairman of the committee it certainly satisfies me. I conclude where I started: I support the amendment; it is an eminently sensible response to an eminently sensible committee report and an eminently sensible bill, which will be good for the users of Corporations Law, good for small business and good for women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share some concerns that my colleague the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) expressed when he spoke on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994. My concerns relate to schedule 4, division 5A, subsection (2). This is one of the aspects of this bill that has received only general support. In fact, the committee's report says on page 17 at 2.37:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has been unable to reach an unqualified view on the test&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is to do with the test for large and small companies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and believes that the Attorney-General should give serious consideration to two options, namely that the 50 employees criteria remain, or that the test of more than 50 employees be deleted from the bill and the test for a small/large proprietary company be on the proposed assets and turnover criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>I am disappointed and concerned that this section has not had greater consideration. The committee was advised by the corporate law simplification task force that, on the basis of statistics provided by the ASC, 98 per cent of proprietary companies would fall within the small category and that it would be only two per cent of Australian companies that might get caught out having to report when it is not necessary and having to do a full audit report at a high cost of somewhere between $10,000 to $30,000, according to the accounting profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this subclause which addresses the distinction between small and large proprietary companies callously disregards the one to two per cent of small and medium sized enterprises which will be disadvantaged by the introduction of this bill in the House today. I am disappointed about that. It is very easy for us to throw figures around like one and two per cent, but when we consider that there are almost 800,000 small businesses in this country that means that 10,000 to 15,000 businesses stand to be disadvantaged by the measure in this bill. That is not good enough. As far as I am concerned, it is a fairly cavalier approach. There is no reason for this to become a problem. There are other ways to deal with this issue. I think it does away with the whole spirit of what this bill is all about&mdash;that is, simplifying the Corporations Law. The reason we want to see simplification of corporation law and other laws in relation to small business is to reduce the cost for small business of doing business and improve the profitability of small business, and this simply does not address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee stated in its findings, conclusions and recommendations, on page 33, paragraph 4.3, that the committee has been unable to reach an unqualified view. The members were not able to totally agree. I do not think that the committee fully appreciated or understood the impact that this might have and the fact that that one to two per cent translates into a very large number of small businesses and affects quite a number of people. One has to ask: who is responsible for law making in this country&mdash;the elected representatives of this place or the bureaucrats? While I appreciate that the bureaucrats make a powerful and very important contribution to the work of this House, ultimately we are the people's representatives and we are out there understanding day to day the difficulties that people confront as they go about their business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flow-on effect of these tests will be to increase the complexity of the law for this group of people; to increase the amount of paperwork and financial reporting required, which no-one is going to be interested in; and to increase the cost to small businesses involved through the cost of unnecessary audit requirements. As I said, it could cost anything from $10,000 to $30,000. This will have the potential to needlessly increase small business costs by millions of dollars. That is not the aim of the corporate law simplification project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a letter this morning from one of the accounting bodies making the comment that the adverse implications that would flow from the implementation of the size test are that some small companies will escape their reporting obligations; some large companies will be required to needlessly prepare accounts; additional costs will be needed to identify business size; the overturning of the accounting standard for the reporting entity that was developed by the Australian Accounting Standards Board over a period of five years through a rigorous process more complex than the simplification process; it conflicts with the Corporations Law; and simplification simply has not been achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just pick up where I left off. I should have perhaps asked for the matters to be considered separately and then I would not have been interrupted in quite this way. If I can conclude the comments I was making on particularly the debenture matter, we are of the view that, the government having accepted that the ASC should be able to provide restrictions on access to venture registers and an amendment having been moved, it was worthy of support and it will have our support, as I indicated earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other matters that I wanted to advert to briefly, which was picked up by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), was that of the single member companies as proposed under the bill. It would eliminate the silent director who is often the spouse and is often jointly responsible for company failure, even though they may not have been fully involved. That title `sexually transmitted debt' was something that we had noted as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to auditors of proprietary companies, while less stringent requirement for appointment of auditors was of concern to the accounting bodies consulted, the committee accepted that that did not require amendment to the bill; rather, that the problem would be addressed by the accounting working party set up under the simplification process. As the government has given a guarantee that the working party will give full consideration to that issue, we welcome that undertaking. I understand that the government has accepted the recommendation from the committee that the inclusion of a small business guide should be reviewed by the Attorney-General after it has been in operation for a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to preparation of final financial reports and the recommendation that the ASC should prepare quarterly reports to the Attorney-General stating its reason for requiring small proprietary companies to prepare accounts, the government has indicated it will raise that matter with the chairman.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank all members for their contribution. I think the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and what it attempts to do is pretty strongly supported by both sides of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) is a fairly harsh taskmaster when it comes to her particular criticisms.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, when we move from a system which is in place to a new system of distinguishing between large and small companies and the sorts of requirements we put on both, some companies which are now enjoying the status of being an exempt proprietary company will be picked up and deemed to be large. But the test does very much target companies in terms of their economic significance. If a company has two of the three requirements&mdash;50 employees, an annual turnover of $10 million, and assets of $5 million&mdash;it is a relatively large and important commercial concern. I do not know whether it is unreasonable for the community to expect a somewhat more stringent level of disclosure in terms of the financial position and activities of those companies than for the vast majority which will get very great benefit out of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures have been put at 98 per cent to two per cent, so it is the vast majority who are getting a much greater benefit. That is why the bill has been very warmly received by the small business community, at least as far as the views that have been expressed to me are concerned. There will be a small number affected. I do not know whether it is the 15,000 figure. That would be 15,000 companies which probably have more than 50 employees, but they would have to have 50 employees plus meet one of the other two tests as well. So I think it would actually be a figure somewhat less than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which the honourable member for Pearce raised was the reporting entity concept which the accounting bodies are very attached to and have been for some years and which they promote very strongly. In fairness, one has to say that the vast balance of views of people in this area&mdash;particularly the lawyers, in terms of the Law Council of Australia, and other advisers concerned with how these things can be made to work in a practical sense&mdash;is that the reporting entity concept is not a practical one to put into operation. If we are not now talking about a program, like it or not, the three criteria are at least fairly straightforward and simple and companies will know whether they fall within it or not. The reporting entity concept is a far vaguer concept and, though it has some attractions, in my view and, indeed, in the view of the committee, the proposed tests are the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are new changes. It is a new area of law and we are trying some innovative things. As I have indicated, the government will review these changes very closely. We want to try to benefit, and get cost reductions for, business. We want innovative reforms that actually work. Therefore, we will watch this legislation very closely. If it is not working, if there are problems, if the thresholds are impacting on much larger numbers of companies in an adverse way, or if it is not in the public interest for the information to come out, we will change it. We are really trying to do a positive thing here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support the amendments that are before the House and I commend the government for them. I must say at the outset that I was surprised at the rather mean spirited remarks of the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), when he was responding on behalf of the opposition to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott). The member for Goldstein seemed to think that there was something terrible in the fact that the government and the SMA had reconsidered the licensing fee that they were going to charge amateur radio operators. I will come back to that later in my contribution, but it is worth while putting on the record that the remarks were mean spirited. As members of parliament, rather than attacking the government for responding to people who make representations, we should be commending the government and the government agency, instead of telling them that we are starting to keep a closer eye on them for doing this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments will make it easier for apparatus licensees to pay their licence fees. They will now be able to make those payments annually for an apparatus licence, in instalments if they wish, and licences can be issued for a period of up to five years. That puts a little bit more certainty into these things for the licensees. Licensees will be able to have the choice of paying the total fee for the full period or paying by annual instalments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Formerly, a default in the payment of a licence fee&mdash;which was usually an up-front fee&mdash;would have resulted in the suspension or cancellation of a licence. There was no scope to allow a licensee a period of grace in the payment of the fees. Often, people who needed these licences as an integral and ongoing part of their business could have been deprived of them through falling on hard times and suffering cash flow problems. These amendments make it a lot easier for business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are amendments which will introduce a system whereby people who default on an annual instalment will only lose their licences as a last resort. Licensees will now be able to pay by instalment, paying interest on the late payment of fees and, if still in default, pay the balance of the licence fee for the entire period. As I said, the licence would only be suspended or cancelled as a last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those amendments to the bills are the result of a long and detailed public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency. In 1993, in response to a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the government directed the Spectrum Management Agency to inquire into the restructuring of licence fees for cost recovery. The Spectrum Management Agency released a public discussion paper, held extensive public seminars and consulted with the Wireless Institute of Australia and the Radiocommunications Consultative Council. Over 4,000 submissions were received, and the amendments before us today are among the many key recommendations to emerge from that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SMA plans to begin issuing five-year licences from April this year in line with the commencement of the radcom licensing computer system. It should be emphasised that these bills are intended to give apparatus licensees a choice, and give them flexibility in the way that they obtain their licences. They do not relate at all to the restructuring of the apparatus licence regime fee structure which has caused some concern amongst sections of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman of the caucus committee on transport and communications I have received representations expressing concern about some aspects of the SMA's draft proposal for the change to the fee structure. With a number of other government members&mdash;and also, I understand, some members of the opposition&mdash;I have made approaches to the government to have the proposed fee schedule re-examined. Rather than the mean spirited way in which the member for Goldstein addressed this, I would like to commend the Spectrum Management Agency and the parliamentary secretary, because I am pleased to see that the SMA has further considered the level of fees to be applied to amateurs in the light of the public benefit that amateurs provide to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lower overall fee is now proposed by the SMA in view of the training and the experience in communications technology that amateurs provide to young people, and the role that amateurs provide in maintaining communication links in times of emergency. The SMA has quite rightly decided to reduce the tax component of the licence fee to the minimum level. This will reduce the fee from the proposed $71 to $51 per annum. The fee would be applied to all amateur licences. While $51 represents a small increase on fees paid for many years by amateurs, the new fee is based on the administration and maintenance services provided to this group by the SMA and includes the cost of issuing the licences, managing interference to their services, issuing and registering call signs, accrediting examinations, and representing amateurs' interests in the international negotiations that the government carries on from time to time. It also represents a reduction of $20 from the draft fee which was proposed prior to the most recent round of consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are social benefits of amateur radio, the fee set at $51 represents more than fair value for their access to and ongoing use of large amounts of radio frequency spectrum. The important thing is that this reduction in the fee has not been shifted onto others, because the change in the level of amateur fees will not be offset by an increase in the fees paid by other radiocommunications licensees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the parliamentary secretary and the SMA should be commended for taking into account the work that amateurs do, both in times of national emergencies and in providing a very useful network that the community as a whole can take advantage of. People might recall that, during the bushfires in Sydney last year, people in the amateur radio area were involved in helping the State Emergency Service people. I think it was proper and reasonable for the government to take cognisance of the representations that were made, and it was proper and reasonable for the SMA to reflect that element in the fees that it charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the fees for amateur radio operators are part of the broader change to apparatus licences. The fee structure proposal is just one of the results of the inquiry that the SMA conducted for all users of the radio frequency spectrum, not just amateur radio users. The government's objective is to establish an efficient and equitable means of managing this vital national resource. It is a resource that all Australians ought to share in, through the licensing of the spectrum. The changes to apparatus licences are designed to reduce the number of categories of licences, and to provide for a more equitable distribution of the charges that are already made for the use of the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals put forward by the Spectrum Management Agency suggest fees based on a combination of the costs of administration and the value of the part of the spectrum being used. This method of charging is in line with the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, in which both the government and the opposition participated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until now, as honourable members would know, fees and categories of licensed radiocommunication equipment have developed in an ad hoc fashion, over time, with little relationship between the fees charged for the spectrum used and the value of that spectrum. The cost to the Commonwealth of the administration and use of the public resource of the radio frequency spectrum should be reflected clearly in the pricing structure. That was one of the key findings of the public inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using this method, fees for some categories may rise, while some fees will fall. However, it should be stressed that no overall variation in revenue is being proposed. Fee concessions will be available to non-profit voluntary apparatus licensees who are primarily providing safety or human life services, such as rural firefighting and sea rescue. In broad terms, local governments and state governments could expect to benefit from the restructuring of the fees. Small businesses, such as taxi services and paging services, are also likely to see fee reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is fully aware of the concern&mdash;a concern, I might add, which has been preyed on by some opposition members, such as Senator Alston&mdash;that the proposed restructuring might result in higher fees being charged for amateur operators. They will be higher, but they will not be as high as was proposed, for the reasons that I outlined before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that some people have been misleading the public by comparing the suggested fees for amateurs with the fees for CB radio operators, who are now covered by a class licence. It is a very unfair proposition, which is being put forward by some people in the community, to say that CB operators will have a very low one-off fee but amateur radio operators will have a higher fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be made clear that CB and amateur operators are utilising quite different services, which both the government and international organisations provide. The CB users occupy very limited amounts of the spectrum, and they do not require any sort of frequency coordination. They can cut across each other and no-one can complain. There is no responsibility carried by the Spectrum Management Agency for interference investigation within the two bands subject to CB licences. The Spectrum Management Agency's activities with regard to CB licences are confined to resolving interference by CB operators to other services, and investigating complaints of abusive or offensive language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, amateur licensees generally occupy a part of the radio frequency spectrum that is highly sought after by alternative users. In Australia, they have access to 44 blocks of spectrum in 23 different bands. That is well above that available in most other countries, and very dramatically different from the amount of spectrum available to CB operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amateurs receive other services from the SMA, such as regular consultations with the Wireless Institute on variations and additions to spectrum availability. The SMA also represents amateurs' interests at international councils. If amateur operators were required to negotiate on their own behalf, they would have to bear a very heavy expense, and it would certainly cost a lot more than the extra $20 by which the licence fee has been increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amateur operators should remember that the SMA recently negotiated international licensing requirements on behalf of Australian amateur operators at no additional direct cost to them, other than the increase in their licence fee. The SMA also arranges and accredits examinations conducted by the Wireless Institute and provides comprehensive interference investigation for operators. That is an entirely different level of service from that provided to the gabble on the two CB bands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, amateur licensees sometimes assist in emergencies and provide their service as a public benefit. The government has recognised that by reducing some of the costs to amateur operators. However, there are many other radiocommunications users who also provide these services in emergencies, while continuing to pay very significant fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the amendments today will facilitate a degree of flexibility in the radiocommunications licensing area that was not there before. That will be good for small business operators, it will be good for state and local authorities, and the reduction in fees will be good for amateur radio operators. I commend the bill to the House and, in doing so, commend the parliamentary secretary for his responsiveness to calls from members on this side of the House and others for a sympathetic response to the plight of amateur operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many amateur operators are retired people. Others are disabled people who have taken this on as a way of communicating with the rest of the world, while housebound by their disability. Thus the government has helped business, local authorities and the amateur operators who put a lot of hard work in for the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As specified by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) in his second reading speech, the main purpose of these amendments is to assist the implementation of a new apparatus licensing system, which has resulted from a public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency. It is important that, prior to making changes to the scheme that has governed radiocommunications in this country, we consider very carefully the role played by amateur radio operators in the industry and, more importantly, in the wider community, and how this bill may impact on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 20,000 amateur radio operators in Australia provide a free community service, particularly in time of national disaster and emergency. After Cyclone Tracy, all communications with Darwin were provided by amateur radio networks. The Wireless Institute's civil emergency network, which is provided by amateur operators, is used during bushfires, floods and other disasters in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States of America and many other countries recognise the value of amateur radio operators by issuing free licences, while Australian operators must pay one of the highest fees in the world. The Spectrum Management Agency planned to impose a tax on the radio spectrum used by amateurs by more than doubling the fee charged from $35 to $71. I am pleased to hear that the government has now backed away from that, and the fee is now to increase to $51. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument used by the SMA was that amateurs should be taxed according to the amount of spectrum they use. That argument does not hold water. The spectrum is fixed by international treaty, and the SMA has little say over the matter. It could not reallocate most of the amateur frequencies to commercial interests even if it wanted to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding, after taking the time to talk to amateur operators in my electorate, is that the world is divided basically into three broad divisions for the purpose of management of the amateur radio spectrum as agreed by international treaty. It is in the Oceania division that Australia sits for the purpose of management. And it is management that we are talking about here today. What has been introduced is a new scheme of management for the spectrum, a scheme of fees categorised by either a spectrum maintenance charge or a spectrum access tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting point to note here is that the spectrum access tax is more of a spectrum denial fee. Primary spectrum users deny spectrum to other users and thus the charge of this fee or tax. This is okay if there is an alternative user for the spectrum, but in the spectrum allocated to amateur users the Spectrum Management Agency has no say on its use other than for amateur radio. The use of the spectrum for amateur radio is fixed by international treaty and thus is binding on Australia. I could, of course, go on to make comment on this government's almost blind adherence to every treaty that has ever come into existence, but I will refrain from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I do find hard to swallow is the tale that the government should be trying to tax the use of amateur spectrum on the basis of exclusion when it has no mandate or authority in any manner to allow any use for that particular spectrum other than amateur use. As to these spectrums, many are fixed as exclusively amateur worldwide and are of no commercial value to Canberra. Most of the others are already assigned to commercial or government primary users and to amateurs as secondary. Once again, the SMA cannot vary the amateur usage because that is covered by international treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another point, there are some 300,000 CB radio operators in Australia. They do not have to pass an examination, yet the amateur radio operators have to pass three exams at a 70 per cent pass level in order to gain a certificate. Some CB operators use their stations and repeaters for business, while amateur radio operators are forbidden to do so by law. The licence fee for CB operators has been abolished. The question has to be asked: why should amateur radio operators have to pay when CB users do not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinct role and position of the amateur radio operator as a competent professional and a controlled operator is very clear. I recently visited amateur radio operators VK6 VX, VK6 VHI and VK6 XX in Albany in Western Australia and I was impressed with the use that is now being made of computers linked into amateur radio networks, in particular the ability of these amateurs to operate programs which not only show the track of satellites, including the one that I observed of a Russian space station passing over Albany at the time, but also are able to communicate with those stations. Both NASA and the Russian authorities have recognised the value of the amateur radio network by incorporating those links into the space station and shuttle programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a more important note, I was able to see the message traffic that was generated out of the Kobe earthquake disaster, straight after that terrible earthquake struck that city. The residents of that city would no doubt have been thankful that the amateur radio network was in place to pass their cries for help worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation under this scheme where one of the ongoing effects will be to double the user fee for our amateur radio operators. Coming from an electorate of over 28,000 square kilometres, I recognise the true value of the amateur radiocommunication network. The government should reconsider its position on amateur radio operators and recognise the immense value of their work in the community and not impose this increase to this particular area. Indeed, as I mentioned, the government really should look at the huge value of the amateur radio operators to the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we have another example of this government's propensity to tax the community of Australia with absolutely no mandate whatsoever. We have these bills before us today, with titles which all include the word `taxes': the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Amendment Bill, the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill, and the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that this government has an unbelievable preoccupation with tax, trying to satisfy an insatiable thirst for revenue. There is a suggestion that everything that moves, and sometimes even everything that dies, should be taxed; and not only taxed here, but taxed at a whole variety of different points. I have spent 20 months in this parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker; and given what I remember of the March 1993 election, I would say that if this government has any mandate whatsoever it is not to increase taxes. But here we have another example of its preoccupation. The government is so preoccupied with taxing that it wants to tax hobbies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted that the government has responded to what has been a fairly massive degree of representation, and I have noted that most members have received letters from persons within their own electorates who are amateur and ham radio operators. I do not think the government can take too much credit for reducing a proposed increase in its tax on amateur radio operators. All it has done is to reduce it by $20. It is still an increase in a tax on a hobby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can appreciate that there are other elements, and that the purpose of this legislation is to enable some flexibility in the payment of annual licence instalments. There may be some merit in that, and to that extent the coalition is not opposing these bills. However, my namesake, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) has just appealed to the government to reconsider its intent to tax a group of Australians who make a contribution to our community. I would like to take the opportunity later to demonstrate that it is a valuable contribution. The government ought to consider what it might cost a government to provide the sorts of resources in terms of public safety and contribution to public events that are provided by ham and amateur radio operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when it is considered that the annual revenue from licence renewals is something around $100 million per year, it is clear that it is already a significant source of revenue for the government, so I was particularly annoyed to see the Spectrum Management Agency proposing initially to double licence fees. I was at least somewhat relieved to hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott), when he introduced these bills, say that there has been some amendment to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Spectrum Management Agency currently supervises about 250,000 radio licences. The fees for these have in the past varied from $18 a year for smaller marine licences and for CB and VHF operators to some huge amounts for multiple public mobile telecommunication services, fees for which often amount to several hundreds of dollars&mdash;even $700,000 per year on big installations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address the assistance that is provided by amateur radio operators, particularly in emergency situations. The support they provide to community organisations has been a consistent part of their ethos, and has been promoted by radio operators as part of that ethos for decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other valuable contributions&mdash;I have a notable number of international radio operators in my own electorate&mdash;is the contribution they make to the worldwide promotion of goodwill because of their community and international communications. I have been informed by some of them that, when they have made comments about this increase to some of their international corresponders via the radio spectrum, other amateur operators in other countries are completely surprised to find that this country wants to introduce such a dramatic increase in fees. I think it ought to be labelled as a cynical revenue raising exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the previous speaker, the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), called us cynical and mean spirited in the contributions that we have already made to this debate. The only mean spirited people that the community of Australia ought to be alerted to are those who occupy the government benches. It is unbelievably mean spirited of them to tax community and amateur operators out there who, as I have said, provide such a valuable contribution to this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Radiocommunications Act 1992 made provision for people such as community amateur radio operators because it included `adequate provision for use by public or community services'. The act also requires `a responsive and flexible approach to meeting the needs of users'. The substantial increase in licence fees causes me great concern because of its inconsistency with existing provisions of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> From that I formed my own conclusion about what a cynical tax raising exercise this is turning out to be. None of my corresponders are encouraged by the government's recent announcements that the amount of the increase is to be reduced. They still maintain that, as amateur radio operators who provide a valuable communication facility to train personnel in what is an important area of communications, their role should be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As the member for Forrest said, I would urge this government to reconsider that particular part of the legislation because it is completely unfair. I see no justification whatsoever in taxing this particular narrow group of people who are confined by the fact that they are a captive audience because they have fixed locations which are easy to find and, therefore, easily sourced for taxation revenue increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Peter Milne of Mildura, whose call sign is VK 3PM, was one of my corresponders. I would like to quote parts of his letter to me in order to make his complaint part of the public record. He introduces his letter by referring to the proposed changes by the Spectrum Management Agency. He then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amateur radio is a recreational and educational "hobby" pursued by a wide range of people in our community. Amateur Radio is of immense benefit to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many instances where it has played a crucial and important part in providing emergency communications where civil and military systems have been unable to perform.</PARA>
<PARA>He then provides examples of communications with respect to Cyclone Tracy in Darwin, recent bushfires in many of our states and past earthquakes in New South Wales. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a hobby that produces effective self training in technology. Many young people graduate to a career in electronics having had their ambitions developed through such an interest. The Scouts and Guides movements of Australia have many stations used in training of their youth. There is immense social value in a recreational hobby particularly suited to handicapped persons and also senior citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>I continue to quote from Mr Milne's letter. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Amateur Radio Service provides a ready pool of trained personnel available for service to the country . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would emphasise just how important the contribution of  amateur radio operators is in rural areas, especially in an area like mine which is 70,000 square kilometres, one-quarter of the north-west of Victoria. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Amateur radio operators are among the world leaders in development of new technology and have recently made significant contributions to research in areas such as satellite technology and radio propagation studies. The hobby provides a valuable service in development of international relations. There are many more positive aspects that could be mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA>He sought my support to have the proposed fee increases rescinded. He has that support, and he has the support of all of us on this side of the House. It is quite clear that in terms of amateur radio the government ought to have made more appropriate allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Milne's letter refers to some of the community benefits of amateur radio, but there are many others which are impossible to measure in dollar terms. You could not measure in dollar terms the benefit of amateur community radio. Therefore, I find it unbelievable that the government would let its insatiable thirst for revenue override such benefits and that it would propose a cost to services when it has not even considered what it would cost the government to provide such services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw attention to a particular, huge community event that occurs in my electorate. It is the Murray River marathon. The marathon starts as far upstream the Murray River as Albury and ends in Swan Hill, which is the city in which I reside. The role that amateur radio and the communication networks play that ensures the community and public safety of that event is just one example of which I am already aware of the benefit of amateur radio operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get back to the more particular focus of this legislation, like many other pieces of legislation brought to this House, it is all about tax&mdash;for goodness sake, tax it; tax it if it moves! Fuel tax is an unbelievable impost that affects everything we do, particularly those in rural Australia. I am reminded of the government's obfuscation during its last election campaign when it had those TV advertisements with cash registers popping up at the sight of a tube of toothpaste showing an extra 15 per cent tax. That was a complete obfuscation of the truth, and it completely overlooked the fact that the government's last policy was to remove seven taxes and have only one fair and balanced tax. So, if this government has any mandate, it is not to increase taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax it if it dies! Every year in pre-budget deliberations, we hear about death duties and inheritance tax. Tax it if it burns! We recently heard intonations from the government that it wanted to introduce a carbon tax. Thankfully that was knocked on the head. It would have imposed more on-costs to business in this country. Tax it if you sell it&mdash;wholesale sales tax! Tax it again if you buy it! The dramatic increases we have seen in the last 20-odd months in wholesale sales tax completely surpass anything we had originally proposed or intended with the goods and services tax. Tax it if it gains value&mdash;a capital gains tax! Now we hear suggestions that if it sleeps it will be taxed&mdash;a bed tax. What an imposition that is going to be on the valuable tourist industry of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to amateur radio, I think it is outrageous and completely unfair. The government ought to reconsider. It has given some reconsideration, but I think it ought not increase at all this particular component of amateur radio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding of taxation is that tax ought to be levied on a profit or a likely profit. I remind the government that licence by regulation would prohibit amateur radio operators having a profit. So how could taxing it be right? Tax on the use of radio spectrum, which is already set aside by international convention for amateur radio, does not occur in any other country. So it is completely unfair, unjust and flies in the face of practice in other countries. From what I hear, we are already something of a laughing stock in the international communities in which amateur radio communicates. No other country in the world levies such a tax on their amateur radio operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the government really aware of the size of the group it wants to antagonise by the introduction of this tax and the powerful communication facility they have available to communicate a message about the lack of mandate this government has to tax them? Currently, there are about 18,000 amateur radio operators and, internationally, their numbers are measured in millions&mdash;a huge communication network. They have powerful radiocommunications at their disposal&mdash;they talk a lot. As I said, already international reaction is not favourable on this government's intent to tax them. This particular aspect of this legislation has been grossly ill-considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, because amateur radio operators are a registered minority, they are an easy target. I refer again to Mr Milne's letter where he asks for my support to see what I can do about ensuring that these increases are not imposed. In his letter he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I require your support towards action to have the proposed fees rescinded and another more suitable approach taken. We would consider it an excellent result if we were granted licences free of charges as is the case in the United States where the community, education and recreational value of Amateur Radio is highly valued.</PARA>
<PARA>I assure Mr Milne that I do oppose this unjust form of tax. The government ought not hide behind its statement that this legislation is all about a positive gesture of allowing greater flexibility in the payment of radio licence charges. I recognise and support professional and large radio licence operators having their fees reduced by taking up payment options. My particular objection is that I consider amateur radio operators an important group of Australians who have a function to fulfil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package was developed as a result of public inquiry which was initiated as far back as December 1993 at the direction of the government. This package aims to respond to industry requirements resulting from that inquiry into that more flexible arrangement, so I support that aspect. The new payment options introduced by the package coincide with a whole new licensing computing system and will therefore provide a much clearer and easier administration.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least that part seems to meet some of the aspirations of the industry. But nowhere in the legislation or in reading the background information do I find any justification for the `punitive' attitudes towards amateur radio operators. I do not think they ought be used to subsidise some of the gains that might be achieved for other licensed operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the government that we will take every opportunity to remind them that it has no mandate to increase taxes on Australians. We bitterly oppose these arrangements and certainly take offence at a bill like this which seeks to call increases in tax revenue through licence fees `revenue gaining exercises'. They are simply taxes and they cost Australians, and we are opposed to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the Radiocommunications (Transmitter Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994 and cognate bills. I was very disappointed to hear the comments of the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) who, I know, is concerned about all issues that may impact on his constituents. I believe he is not presenting the full facts. I dare say that the criticism in relation to this bill goes back to 18 January when the shadow minister for communications and the arts, Senator Alston, took up this issue in a press release. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that amateur operators have the misfortune to be a disciplined, individually licensed service and, therefore, an easy target for revenue raising . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on and on. While we all recognise the contribution made to the community by amateur radio hams, the opposition spokesperson failed to indicate that he had any idea of what was in the report of the Spectrum Management Agency. He said that it indicated that there had been no consultation. The facts are at variance with that statement. Indeed, if the member for Mallee had cared to look at the information, he would have been able to clarify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 December 1993 the then communications minister, the present Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), instituted the inquiry. Throughout January and February 1994, the SMA distributed over 4,000 copies of the discussion paper to interested parties, advertised widely and then proceeded to conduct 14 public seminars attended by over 900 people. It received 422 submissions and reported its findings to the then Minister for Communications and the Arts, the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), at the end of May 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At every stage of the proceedings there was close consultation with the Institute of Wireless Operators. Indeed, it was very involved when this issue was being looked at. There is hardly a case for saying that there has been no consultation. There has actually been widespread consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general line being presented is that the whole basis of the legislation we are now debating&mdash;the report of the Spectrum Management Agency, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the apparatus licence system: a new outlook</EMPHASIS>&mdash;came about because we have a down on amateur radio operators in this country. In fact, as is quite clear from the report, the reforms go to the whole management of radio communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Elliott) introduced these bills, he made it clear that the licence for amateurs would be a flat rate of $51; the original proposal for $71 had been just that, only a proposal. The reforms are widespread and very pertinent to the handling of this area of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report includes a number of recommendations. In relation to citizens band licences, there was a recommendation, adopted in October 1994, for class licences. Other recommendations include: the simplification of apparatus licence categories; arrangement for licence terms up to five years with very flexible payment arrangements&mdash;one of the key factors in the bills we are debating; the possibility of transferring apparatus licences between parties; and, very importantly, licence fee concessions for volunteer non-profit emergency organisations, such as rural firefighters, search and rescue organisations, coastguards, surf lifesavers and ambulance services in remote areas. Then there was a definite decision to charge for a range of services provided by the Spectrum Management Agency. Those charges are to be introduced on an equitable and transparent basis so that people can understand what the charges are for and why they are paying them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What irks me is that the opposition parties continually bleat about government charges and cutting government expenditure. But the minute there is a specific option for user pays principles, for making sure that services are provided and that the government is accountable, they are bleating about how shocking it is that we are raising another tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is very unfair. I am sure all other honourable members have made representations on behalf of amateur radio operators. I take the time and trouble to find out the facts. Unfortunately, it seems that some of my colleagues in the opposition&mdash;and particularly the shadow minister&mdash;have decided that it is easier to score a cheap political point than to go and make a proper investigation. The shadow minister is the person who would like to be running this area of the government. This is a wide ranging report which has a number of very positive reforms for the use of the spectrum. All the shadow minister can talk about is this one small point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one in this country wants to pay taxes but everybody wants services. Local amateur radio operators in my area felt this was an impost. I am sure they will be delighted with the very sensible decision made by the government. It is not about not charging them. Our amateur radio operators have done all the good things that my colleague the honourable member for Mallee suggested. I have no argument with all those good things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the amateurs were paying limited fees for the services they received, other essential services were paying much greater charges. One of the key benefits in these reforms is that a lot of these essential services will have a decrease in charges. That is a very sensible rationalisation. I refer to the editorial by Jim Rowe in the March 1995 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Electronics Australia</EMPHASIS>. Mr Rowe indicated that he had lots of representations from amateur radio operators. He has taken a very responsible position. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amateur licence fees haven't risen for about 10 years, even though the cost of most other goods and services have risen quite significantly in that time. Some sort of rise was probably inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say that there will be increasingly fierce competition for space in the electromagnetic spectrum. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many ways this is a finite resource, and historically amateurs have accumulated quite a lot of spectrum `real estate'. In fact I understand that in Australia, amateurs are second only to the Department of Defence in terms of their total allocation of spectrum space.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA has sought to base them clearly on the real costs of issuing and renewing licences, and also on managing each licensee's activities&mdash;together with a `spectrum access cost' or tax, based on the perceived value of the spectrum segment(s) being used on an exclusive basis. On the whole this seems reasonable, and is in fact the kind of changes taking place in many other countries as well.</PARA>
<PARA>This is rather interesting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem for amateurs is that because quite a lot of spectrum is allocated to them, applying this rationale strictly `across the board' would result in amateur licence fees rising to well over $500 per year.</PARA>
<PARA>If we really wanted to put in place a user pays principle, that is the sort of charge that would be allocated because, as Jim Rowe says, a significant amount of spectrum is allocated to amateur operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that has to be taken into consideration is that, if you are going to get into this hobby, which has lots of positive spin-offs, including emergency availability when there is an accident or a major disaster&mdash;and I commend the comments of my colleague the member for Mallee in this matter&mdash;the equipment will cost you at least $2,000. It is a considerable investment for people who choose to become involved or interested in this area or hobby. Therefore, a charge of $51, or even $70, would not seem to me to be a major impost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns brought to me that I responded to was about what appeared to be a sudden jump. Jim Rowe&mdash;and I assume he knows a great deal more about this area than I do&mdash;finishes his article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might well be prudent for amateurs to swallow hard and accept this fee rise, without much fuss. Attracting a lot of interest might cause renewed demands for some of that precious spectrum space, by potential users willing to pay a lot more for the privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>That has not really been taken into consideration by some of our operators, for very well-intentioned reasons, but it has also not been taken into consideration for what I would consider fairly cheap political reasons by some members of the opposition, particularly by the person who would like to be making the decisions in this area&mdash;Senator Alston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the suggested reforms to licensing types, we see very clearly that this report has done a very good job. It has done a very good job because there has been, as I said before, this wide ranging consultation. There was a commitment that this consultation would continue in relation to a range of issues, including the cost to amateurs. Page 5 of the SMA discussion paper suggested that the licence types should be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.workable in number;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.clear, simple and mutually exclusive;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.able to accommodate new developments in technology and service delivery;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   be consistent with SMA management functions, such as planning, applying licence conditions and setting fees; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">be administered efficiently (for example, by automation). </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, as a general principle, there should be a minimal number of `broad purpose' licence types. This approach is consistent with the majority of submissions to the inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, it came up with a grouping of 16 new transmitter licence types with three new receiver licence types which would be based on definitions in the Australian spectrum plan. I just want to go through those briefly to indicate the breadth of areas we are talking about. The first area is aeronautical. The second area is aircraft. The third area is amateur, and within amateur are several subgroupings: unrestricted, limited, novice, intermediate, novice limited, amateur beacon and amateur repeater. They are allocated a proposed differing amount. The fourth area is broadcasting, which includes broadcast service and narrowband area service. The other areas are defence; earth; fixed; land mobile; maritime coast; maritime ship; multipoint distribution station, MDS; outpost; public telecommunications service; radiodetermination; scientific; and space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about a very important area, particularly with the increase in high tech and communications looking for areas of the frequency. I believe the amateurs continue to have a very fair operation. The sorts of licences we are intending to provide under this bill indicate that we are prepared to be very flexible about the way those payments are made&mdash;to make it much easier, for instance, for retired hams to be able to make those payments. I believe we have done a very good job here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to further comment on the public or community service providers. One of the recommendations in the report on page 11 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA considers that concessions should apply to volunteer, non profit, emergency organisations involved in rural fire fighting, search and rescue, coast guard and surf life saving activities (principally providing safety of human life services) and to individuals who support such organisations. Organisations involved in ambulance services in remote areas will also qualify for concessions.</PARA>
<PARA>The sorts of concerns that have been raised by a number of people, including the amateurs, have certainly been considered in this report. The government and the agency have responded to a range of calls from the community about the method of charging, which has been suggested is in line with recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and the public inquiry process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concerns were put to me about the fact that citizens band radio holders had been provided with a class licence. But, from information given to me, it is clear that the CB bands&mdash;although they appear to very numerous&mdash;occupy a relatively small part of the spectrum and do not require the sort of regulation or representation the SMA has made on behalf of the Wireless Institute of Australia in terms of the accreditation of their examinations and international representations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it would appear to individual amateur radio operators on the ground that the Spectrum Management Agency does little for them, a great deal is done on behalf of this group of people&mdash;which is about 20,000 across the country. However, this means that about 30 per cent of licensees would experience fee increases&mdash;this is where the amateur licence holders are found. Local government authorities, state governments and the emergency service organisations will benefit considerably, as will organisations such as taxi operators and paging services&mdash;those small businesses about which the opposition claims to be very concerned. Although I can understand the concerns of amateurs in terms of the CB network, the facts really speak for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return now to the amount of spectrum that is available. Amateurs occupy a great deal of the spectrum&mdash;44 blocks in 23 different bands, which is well above what is generally available in other countries. So there are 20,000 amateurs with 179 times more spectrum than the estimated 800,000 CB operators. Each amateur uses significantly more power than CB users. As I said before, amateurs occupy more spectrum than most others, except the Department of Defence, which I think we would all agree would require a fair degree of spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, through its consultations, has certainly listened to the voice of a relatively small group, and that is the art of politics.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure the coalition responds favourably to the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) saying that we are about fiscal responsibility in managing the financial affairs of the government. There is no question about that, but sometimes it gets back to a matter of priority. One of my early tasks as a member was to sit on the Public Accounts Committee. It was there that I began to see some of the horrifying mismanagement that was occurring. I am sure that if the member for Capricornia discussed this matter with some of her colleagues they would find some very large savings in very many areas so they do not have to be mean spirited with a group of amateur people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1994 a review of radiocommunications apparatus licensing was conducted by Spectrum Management Agency. One of the recommendations arising from that review was that a wider variety of payment options be made available, particularly to avoid the necessity for regular annual licence tax payments when the term of the licence exceeds one year. On the surface, it is a very commendable market driven recommendation. However, I wonder how many members of this House are aware of other activities of the Spectrum Management Agency that make the implication of a wider variety of tax payment options almost a necessity for many of Australia's 18,115 amateur radio licence holders. For these clients of the Spectrum Management Agency, the amendments contained in the radiocommunications bills are, unfortunately, timely. These individuals are faced with the spectre of a new tax on their access to the radio frequency spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until yesterday, amateur radio licence holders were faced with a new tax of $30 per year&mdash;equal to 273 per cent of the annual reissue costs of $11 per year, or 94 per cent of the total administration charge of $32 per year, or 73 per cent of the total annual amateur licence fee of $41 per year. Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), came into this House and subsequently, in yet another about-face by the government, announced more policy on the run. Amateur radio operators are now faced with a total annual fee of $51, a 38 per cent or $14 increase on the current $37 fee. This will be a 400 per cent increase on the 1980 fee, when amateur radio licence fees were $10 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us not be deceived by this cynical about-face by the government. Firstly, as I will outline later, this amazing $20 reduction merely removes a blatant act of discrimination against amateur radio operators. On behalf of my constituents, I am very pleased that the government has bowed to the pressure. I have had very many representations from my electorate on this issue. It is good to see the public getting involved and applying pressure to make appropriate changes. Most importantly, the government's real agenda in this case has been exposed: that is, to tax the amateur radio industry out of existence. This industry will now be left to wonder when the next act of government taxing will focus on its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder that the SMA has implemented some innovative payment schedules to accommodate the payment of the tax on the issue of a receiver licence. Item 2 of the schedule of the Radiocommunications (Receiver Licence Tax) Amendment Bill 1994 inserts proposed new section 6, which gives applicants for receiver licences issued for periods of more than 12 months different options in relation to the payment of the tax. This is all well and good, but it does not address the concerns of those individuals who hold amateur radio licences. They are in many instances young or elderly members of the community. They may be retired war veterans or simply individuals participating in a very worthwhile hobby. Perhaps they belong to the many hundreds of scout and guide groups around Australia. I know of at least 85 scout and guide groups that are registered amateur radio operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps members opposite would like to hear of the concerns of the Girl Guides Association in Western Australia, which wrote to me on 27 February:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Judi,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Girl Guides Association in Western Australia was most perturbed to hear of the forthcoming increases in fees for amateur radio station licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The guides and scout associations both have stations which are used for the training of younger members. Jamboree of the Air could not function without the assistance of a large pool of amateur radio operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A peculiar thing about this whole increase is that over Australia the increase in revenue to the Spectrum Management Agency would only amount to $495,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Spectrum Management Agency have announced that CB operators would have their licence fees completely waived. This means that Spectrum Management Agency has given up a revenue of around $3.6 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As CB operators can use their radio equipment for financial gain as against the amateur's purpose of training and personal intercommunications and, in the case of the guides and scouts, increasing friendship between them and member in other states and countries, it is odd to say the least at the reasoning behind these two decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We request your support towards action to have the proposed fees rescinded.</PARA>
<PARA>That group has my support on that, despite the fact that I am concerned about decreasing benefits for the small business community. I do not think the way to do it is to penalise those in our community who not only operate radios as a hobby but also give back a tremendous community service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On the government's way to the new tax market, a funny thing has happened. The government has decided that the commercial interests associated with CB operators, and the millions of dollars forgone in licence revenue from that market, are somehow made up for by the easy pickings of the amateur radio sector. This is the sort of inequity the community has come to expect from this government. For amateur radio operators, the SMA's new tax payment options contained in the bill are not the only issues foremost in their mind. They are really concerned about whether or not they will be able to continue to afford to hold amateur radio licences at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the Apparatus Licence System&mdash;A New Outlook</EMPHASIS>, the Spectrum Management Agency lists its annual apparatus licence fees. Of the 15 categories listed, the SMA states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minimum spectrum access tax is proposed to be $10. All except three of the non assigned licence sub types will attract the minimum tax.</PARA>
<PARA>It should come as no surprise to honourable members that the three licences that were to attract a higher fee were all amateur radio licences. The fees for amateur radio licences were to be 200 per cent higher&mdash;$30. What possible justification was given? None. Of all the categories listed only one has a higher total fee than amateur radio. The remainder are at least 37 per cent lower, and some of them are as much as 66 per cent lower. What responsible authority would impose such an inequity on a community good? Better still, what sort of government would allow this to be imposed on such a valuable community resource?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated yesterday, the government has been caught out. It has been exposed. The SMA's lame duck excuse that this last minute about-face is the result of further consultation and consideration is simply perpetuating the myth that the SMA is concerned about amateur radio. Its actions clearly reveal otherwise. This is the action of a mean-spirited government that is surreptitiously eroding the quality of life for many Australians. In fact, I think it is called robbing Peter, who is the community, to pay for the excesses of Paul, who is the part-time Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SMA's 273 per cent tax would have raised approximately $550,000 from a community sector that contributes hundreds of hours every year&mdash;worth hundreds of thousands of dollars&mdash;to a voluntary and free community service. The great bulk of this service just happens to be provided during times of crisis in the community and at a time when other traditional and commercial lines of communication are often not functioning. In many other countries this service is not taxed at all. In the United States, Congress has recognised the importance of amateur radio and, consequently, no licences and no taxes are paid by amateur radio operators. But this is not so in Australia. This government's concept of the clever country is to impose a 273 per cent tax on the activities of our scouts, our guides and committed radio enthusiasts, who have repeatedly demonstrated excellence and commitment to the use and development of amateur radio in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must also be emphasised that the amateur radio community operates in true amateur spirit. Unlike other users of the radio frequency spectrum, amateur radio licensees are prohibited from gaining any pecuniary interest from their activities. This government is using amateur radio. Perhaps it could be suggested that the government is blatantly exploiting the goodwill and the commitment of this sector of the community and, in the process, is determined to squeeze every bit of financial gain possible from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very clear comparison of the government's commitment to the community is evident when one looks at the discriminatory way amateur radio users are treated as compared with the way users of citizens band frequencies are treated. CB users have had their licence requirements abolished. That is a windfall of approximately $6.5 million to users of the radio frequency spectrum. It must be noted that the CB users are often commercial operators who do gain financially from their investments. As I said before, as the shadow minister for small business, I am the last one who wants to see any additional costs imposed, but I believe this particular measure is inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills being debated today provide the SMA with the power to determine the amount of tax in respect of the issue of receiver and transmitter licences. I believe it would be automatically assumed that with this power would come responsibility. From the activities of the SMA it not only appears that it does have difficulty in developing equitable taxing and licensing regimes but it also appears, from the information provided by industry participants, that certain senior SMA staff have a great deal of difficulty clearly articulating the SMA's actions, intentions and services to a very well-informed community sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern has been expressed that a misinformation campaign has been embarked upon to cloud the waters of change. This is evident in a transcript from an interview with a senior executive of SMA, who it is alleged provided the following commentary on radio station 5CK at Port Pirie in South Australia on 21 February 1995:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we do is to maintain the same level of revenue and to redistribute that revenue based on a fair and equitable basis. It is true that much of the amateur spectrum is decided by International Treaty, but that's not to say that Governments can't and in fact shouldn't charge. Most governments around the world do, although there are some that don't.</PARA>
<PARA>The Wireless Institute of Australia responded to that statement as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know of no other government that makes a charge to amateur radio operators for access to the spectrum. Some do charge a fee for a station licence whilst in some countries no charge is made at all. Australia would be creating a world precedent by applying a Spectrum Access Tax. I believe that (Mr Grant) the SMA executive is being at the least, deliberately misleading here and could possibly be accused of telling a complete lie.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, that was not the only extract from that interview that drew outrage from the amateur radio community. I refer to the fact that these bills provide the SMA with the power to determine the amount of tax in respect of the issue of a receiver licence. The SMA has certainly learnt very quickly how to apply that power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a recent presentation the SMA identified its revenue estimates for 1995-96. Depending on your point of view it is either interesting or disturbing information. From the point of view of amateur radio operators it is a disgusting example of blatant tax grab. Based on the following figures, I would have to agree. The SMA's revenue forecasts are: 17 per cent from spectrum maintenance charge; three per cent from licence renewal charges; 14 per cent from licence issue charges; two per cent from consultancies; and&mdash;wait for it&mdash;64 per cent or $60.6 million from spectrum access tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures indicate beyond any doubt that the primary activity of the SMA is as a tax gathering front for the government. Unfortunately the amateur radio community is deemed to be a soft touch. The SMA, in its publication titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the apparatus licence system&mdash;a new outlook</EMPHASIS>, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted earlier, all fees are in fact taxes levied under the Tax Acts. The basis for imposing a spectrum access tax on users, above the costs of spectrum management is that the spectrum is a valuable resource and the community is entitled to a monetary return&mdash;or a rent&mdash;for its private use. A direct monetary return, via government, is intended to compensate the community for the user benefiting from access to spectrum. It is also a rationing device.</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of amateur radio, the SMA should practice what it preaches when it refers to valuable resource. In February 1995, the SMA stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SMA appreciates the good work done by the amateur radio enthusiasts in providing services at various times to assist the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also aware of the benefits in encouraging young people to learn about radio.</PARA>
<PARA>The SMA should remember those sentiments and then reconsider its bizarre treatment of this very valuable community resource. The SMA should also listen to others in the community who have commented on the value of the amateur radio network. I would recommend that those on the other side of the House also take note&mdash;wherever they are today. In October 1992, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), addressed the SEANET convention in Darwin. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The work carried out by amateurs when Darwin was ravaged by a cyclone on Christmas Day in 1974 was outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was virtually a total loss of communications with the outside world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When telecommunication links were cut, nothing was heard from Darwin for a number of hours until the lone voice of a Darwin amateur made contact with other amateur operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amateur radio operators must surely feel that they are now a lone voice in the ears of this government and its cohort in this tax exercise, the SMA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the member for the Northern Territory, now that the chips are down for amateur radio people, where does his support lie? He should have a caucus with his colleagues, the member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), the member for Makin (Mr Duncan) and the member for Dickson (Mr Lavarch). I am told they have all offered support to the amateur radio industry. It would appear to be very hollow and ineffectual support if they are not prepared to stand up and publicly be counted on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final commendation that sums up the contribution and community value of the amateur radio community is provided by the Acting Chief Commissioner Robert Falconer of the Victoria Police. With respect to the 1993 Victorian floods he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effort by the Wireless Institute Civil Emergency Network volunteers and the fact that they are volunteers who provide their own time and resources is to be highly commended as in such circumstances it would have been extremely difficult to complete the registration of evacuees by any other method.</PARA>
<PARA>These accolades are given to a valuable community resource. That this government and the SMA seek to tax it out of existence is nothing short of a national disgrace. Like my colleagues, I have had numerous constituents express their anger and concern at the outrageous tax imposts being thrust on amateur radio communities. The views and spirit of the amateur radio community are best summed up by one of my constituents who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are proud of our history and our achievement but realise that keeping ourselves very much to ourselves for so long we're in danger of becoming just another endangered species!</PARA>
<PARA>That communication was received from Mr Harry Atkinson who, in his own words, is blind, aged 81 years, and still kicking&mdash;a great Australian. The coalition supports these amendments. I endorse the comments made by my colleague. I am pleased to see that the government has had a change of heart on this matter in the last few days. No doubt that has been brought about by enormous public pressure and pressure by many of my colleagues in relation to this matter. I do condemn the actions and attitudes of this government and the SMA for their joint attack on the Australian amateur radio community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would think that amateur radio was being taken out of existence when one listens to the opposition in this debate on the radiocommunications bills. It is not. In these days of instant communications, there are a growing number of uses of the radio frequency spectrum and a large number of users.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radiocommunications is more than an industry in its own right; it forms part of another complex communications system and provides an essential transmission medium for telecommunications carriers and broadcasters. Radiocommunications systems also provide the invisible sinews for other industrial sectors including transport, defence, emergency services, mining, agricultural, commerce, manufacturing and maintenance. That does not mention the domestic or hobby users who also make such varied use of radio airways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there are radio navigation and radio location uses for the guidance of ships and aircraft on radio beams and radar and broadcasting uses such as television and sound radio. These are now using satellite as well as earthbound methods. There are transmitters and translators relaying signals across the country into remote areas. We know all about this in Tasmania, especially with the introduction of aggregation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have learned that waves travel in straight lines in empty space, but things like the earth's surface and atmosphere, along with humidity, rainfall and solar activity, can do amazing things to change these signals. Our mountains in Tasmania seem to play great havoc with the new UHF signals. There are all these spaces to be used within the spectrum. And then there are our amateur users, those enthusiasts who have made a hobby out of communication and research around the world, who were the pioneers&mdash;going from the crystal sets and the morse code to the more sophisticated equipment that we install today.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are all those other uses, including radioastronomy; standard time and frequency signals; industrial, scientific and medical, and military and domestic uses. The latter area includes such things as microwave ovens and garage door openers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of these bills, therefore, is to assist the implementation of a new apparatus licensing regime which resulted from a public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency some time ago. It is a chance for apparatus licensees to choose whether they pay their licence fees up-front or by annual instalment. The amendments are not related to the proposed increases to apparatus licence fees, including those for amateur radios. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all these things in modern day life, to make things work better requires some sort of charging. The amateur radio users are one such group in that field. I have had a number of people write to me about the suggested amateur radio licence fee increase to $71. Their suggestion is that it is too much for an amateur group. I feel that there is a lot of merit in their argument. I have discussed this with members on my side of the House and I have put my concerns, as others have done, to the minister. These people do not operate for profit, and they play an important role in research, in emergency communication at times, and just as a communication tool between people who find it very difficult to enjoy physically travelling from place to place. This way they can travel on the radio airwaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has responded to my representations and those of other members of the House on this matter. The SMA has decided to reduce the proposed fee, leading to a flat charge of $51 per annum for all amateurs. It was after consultation and in recognition of the valuable service provided by amateurs to the community in maintaining communication links and in training young people to be proficient in communications technology that the government took this decision, and I believe it was a good decision. I am told this will not be offset by any increase in fees paid by other radiocommunication licensees, so I am really happy that there has been a reasonable outcome to my representations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's labour force figures are indisputable evidence that the government's job strategy not only is on target but has well exceeded it. Today, with the figures that were released, we have smashed through the 500,000 jobs pledge that was made at the time of the last election. Do you remember the 500,000 target&mdash;the one that those opposite said we could not achieve?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was also demonstrated in the labour force figures today was a significant increase in the participation rate, and that had the effect, as most members would be aware, of seeing only a smaller drop in the unemployment rate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This demonstrates that we are a government that was able not only to deliver the jobs but also to open up the opportunity to those jobs&mdash;to recognise that it is important not just to make jobs available but to expand the labour force at the same time.

It would be 3.8 per cent. This is the sort of golden age of full employment that those on the other side want to hark back to in terms of reminding us of the Menzies era. The problem with the Menzies era was that it was full employment only for men. It was only men who were able to participate fully in the opportunities that were provided. The Liberals had no strategy for opening up the opportunity for encouraging women, in particular, to enter the work force.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Bonython for his question. Certainly, I think the employment figures that have been announced today and referred to by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in his earlier question are a tremendous outcome for the nation. A growth of 560,000 additional jobs in two years since the last election is a phenomenal performance&mdash;an absolutely phenomenal performance. And it is the envy, I might say, of most other Western countries who could not remotely think of achieving that kind of outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an outcome which is phenomenal for Australia. I might say though that these seasonal adjustment factors do tend to produce some lumpy outcomes&mdash;we see spurts and we see a slowdown the next month; it is not an even progression. So just because we have this big spurt of 75,000 additional jobs in this month has not meant that we have changed our view about the employment outcome for this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I announced the mid-term review a little over a month ago, I said that we expected the employment outcome for this year to be a 3 3/4per cent increase, up from three per cent in the budget. And today's figure does not really lead us to change that estimate but more or less confirms that we are growing very solidly indeed and that the budget estimates were too low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other countries, as I have said, would certainly look with envy on such growth in employment. If you look at the other OECD countries, you see, generally, rates of increase in employment which are far less than we are experiencing. For 1994, the OECD estimates that  3/4 for all of its member countries, the growth in employment will be 0.7 per cent&mdash;0.7 per cent. This against a background where in our last 12 months, we have just chalked up 4.4 per cent, and for the whole year our estimate was 3 3/4 per cent. So we are growing around four per cent and Western countries generally are doing less than one per cent growth in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, quite clearly, our performance on employment growth is extraordinarily good by comparison with other Western countries. Even for 1995 where it is generally expected that employment outcomes will be better in Western countries generally, the OECD estimate for that year at the moment is 1.3 per cent compared to our figures approaching four per cent. Quite clearly, we are doing extremely well on employment growth in comparison with other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, Mr Speaker, if you look at the comparison with our past, you see also just how good that growth picture is. Since this government was elected just over 12 years ago, employment has increased by 1,865,000 additional jobs. That is an average growth in employment of 155,000 jobs a year. That compares with an average rate of growth of employment when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country, for the five years from 1977 up to 1982, of 52,000. That is 52,000 compared to our 155,000&mdash;approximately 100,000 less than we have achieved on average over the last 12 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So you can clearly see, Mr Speaker, which party has the power to create employment. Quite clearly, it is the Labor Party which has been able to produce employment growth in this country, as against its predecessor government, which failed abysmally in that area when the now Leader of the Opposition was in charge of the Australian economy as Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the comments of the Leader of the Opposition recently, I think they are instructive in that context. Speaking on Adelaide radio station 5AA on 8 February this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The biggest obligation of any government, whether it is Mr Keating's government or the alternative government that we are offering, is to provide an economic climate where people who are wiling to work and able to work can get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, if you look at that&mdash;the biggest obligation of government is to create employment&mdash;you can see who is more capable of producing satisfactory outcomes in respect of that biggest obligation. It is certainly not the opposition, or the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, there is one other element of this employment growth which is very important for the House and for the people of Australia to understand, and that is that it is not just strong employment growth, it is strong employment growth in the context of low inflation. Of course, that is the absolute epitome of good government, to try to achieve strong employment growth in the context of low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came into office we were looking at an inflation rate of 11.4 per cent&mdash;that was the inflation rate that the now Leader of the Opposition left us with when he was Treasurer&mdash;as well as an unemployment rate of 10 per cent. The average inflation rate when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 9.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, the inflation rate has averaged, in our 12 years, 5.4 per cent, almost half of what it was under Mr Howard as Treasurer. We now have an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent&mdash;it has been 2.5 per cent or less for the last three years&mdash;in conjunction with these very high rates of employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, quite clearly, in terms of these fundamentals of good economic management&mdash;achieving strong employment growth, achieving low inflation&mdash;this government has been able to perform extremely creditably both by comparison with the past and by comparison with other countries. I know that the opposition does not like it. It says this employment growth is bad news. It wants to try to doomsay as much as it can. But the reality is that this is unambiguously very good news for the Australian economy.</PARA>

That meant that the ABC would have two of the 10 channels that can use the satellite exclusively until 1997.

The ABC has set up a structure which minimises the risk to funding which is directed to free to air services on radio and television. It is up to the ABC board to determine whether or not it will be involved in pay TV. David Hill has certainly argued very strongly in the past that the ABC cannot be left behind as new forms of technology are introduced and as new services are provided in the Australian communications environment, whether it is in the introduction of digital audio broadcasting with radio or whether it is the introduction of pay television or digital television.</PARA></TALK.START>

I did put one condition on the licence which was issued to the ABC, and that was a requirement for certain levels of Australian content. Given that the ABC was the only one of the three licensees that received a licence without paying any funds to the taxpayer, and without having to go through an option process, I thought that the least we could do was impose certain minimum standards of Australian content on the two ABC channels.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At that time we were talking about unemployment of around 3.8 per cent if we had today's levels of participation. In terms of the implications for the way that the social security system is structured, that meant that the social security system had to, in a sense, be turned outward towards the labour market. Many of the reforms that were carried out in the late 1980s in terms of the so-called active society model have now been proven, in this period of strong recovery, to be quite fundamental in assisting particularly women back into the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms represented by the white paper together with a more incentive based social security system have meant that there were much stronger resources for people to enable them to get the training and the skill enhancement necessary. Again we have seen a quite marked impact, which again explains the rather faster achievement in employment growth than, for example, was achieved coming out of the 1983 recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the numbers today, we see evidence of a dramatic decrease in the number of married couple families who had an unemployed member. I point to one statistic that illustrates the success of a combination of policy. We have seen over the same 12-month period the number of sole parent families, arguably the group most disadvantaged, with employed members increase by 180,000. That is quite a massive improvement and that is what comes from the emphasis this government has placed on child care&mdash;253,000 places&mdash;and on programs like JET where 46,000 jobs for sole parents were created as a result of that program alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise these points because, fundamentally, they are the difference between a government that has policy integrity and looks at the interrelationship between different elements of policy and an opposition that is increasingly negative, increasingly cynical, fundamentally opportunistic and could never achieve reforms of the dimension that this government has achieved.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, under the opposition's Jobsback, we see guarantees only of four miserly conditions: annual leave, four weeks; two weeks non-cumulative sick leave; a minimum hourly rate of pay, not a weekly rate or an annual rate; and unpaid maternity leave. No-one is going to be fooled by that approach and the opposition's attempts to hide the consequences of its Jobsback policy. Opting out offers new employees only those same four miserly conditions, those same four miserable provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobsback does not so much as say what the minimum hourly rate will actually be. All the member for Flinders keeps saying is, `That's a matter of detail. We'll get to it one day.' We are asking: just when are we going to see that detail? When are we going to have revealed to the people of Australia what that minimum rate will be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look to the New Zealand system, which is a system the member for Flinders has waxed lyrical about and is on the public record and the record of this House on many occasions as praising, we see well illustrated the consequences of going down the Jobsback path. We now have on the public record the analysis of Professor Harbridge of New Zealand's Victoria University, who has published an analysis of his country's Employment Contracts Act&mdash;that is, the Employment Contracts Act for which you have been full of praise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That analysis shows that, under that system, women in New Zealand have fared far worse than men. Women have been the principal losers. They get lower wage increases; they have suffered even bigger reductions in overtime rates and in penalty rates than have men in comparable jobs in New Zealand. Members of the House will be interested to know that Professor Harbridge found that new workers in New Zealand are now being offered lower pay and conditions than existing employees. What that means is that in New Zealand you have a system of industrial apartheid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for Oxley for his question. He has a very deep personal commitment to the rights of Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women in particular. The actions of the member for Barker, supported very actively by the member for Hindmarsh, have caused great disquiet, hurt and sadness to Aboriginal people in South Australia, particularly Aboriginal women.

<PARA>The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has never been the same since Mr Kerry Packer went on television and made certain statements. Mr Packer was asked about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He's been around for a long time. I think he's a decent man. I think he's an honest man and I think he's a man who has seen the mistakes made and I don't think he will make them again.</PARA>
<PARA>That was an objective statement of an observer of Australian politics. All Mr Packer said in that statement was what the rest of Australia already knew; that the Leader of the Opposition is a decent man and that the Leader of the Opposition is an honest man. But that statement of what the whole of Australia knew drew the Prime Minister into a fury. The Prime Minister came back and made a statement that no-one else in Australia knew. He made an allegation that he knew something the rest of Australia did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He alleged, in a calculated, specific, dishonest and deceitful allegation, that this statement was made because a secret deal existed between the Leader of the Opposition and Mr Packer. It was a calculated, specific, dishonest and deceitful allegation. The Prime Minister, after failing to detail his allegations to this House, after having the opportunity to come into this House and submit himself to questioning, hopped on a jet and hotfooted it over to Singapore. It was no accident that in Singapore he returned to the theme. As Laurie Oakes reports in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, there he was, down the back of the plane, trying to incite the journalists to write this up. There he was, down the back of the plane, engaging in smear, innuendo, falsehood and lies. He knew that it was false. He knew that he could not substantiate it. He had, cowardly, not come into this House and made the allegations; he went down the back of the plane and tried to seed them in the journalists' minds. Mr Keating claimed to those journalists, as reported by Laurie Oakes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he's told the Packer camp and the Packer camp have told me.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the allegation. He was not trying to base it, as the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) now is, on statements that were in the public domain. It was not enough for Mr Keating to say that the Leader of the Opposition had a genuine view about cross-media ownership. It was not enough to debate the merits, as you are now trying to do, little Sir Echo; be careful. He had to allege a conspiracy and he had to allege a first-hand witness to that conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little Sir Echo did not take long to take up the chant: `War is peace; black is white; the Prime Minister is always right.' But the trouble was that the Prime Minister was in a different time zone. So as the chant came from the Prime Minister and was echoed back in Australia, it became increasingly out of date. I wonder how he felt, after he said that, yes, there was a senior executive in the Packer camp who had given this information to the Prime Minister, when he woke up on Wednesday, 8 March, 1995 and read the headline on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>: `Richardson denies Packer, Howard deal'. I wonder how he felt when the godfather of his own faction, former senator Graham Richardson, walked away from him? I wonder how he felt when Peter Barron, the great strategist of the Labor Party, walked away from him? I wonder how he felt when the senior executives denied the substance of this claim? I wonder how he felt when Mr Packer denied the substance of the claim? I know how he felt when the Leader of the Opposition denied the substance of the claim: he felt caught, and he was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To believe this minister, Mr Packer is a liar, the Leader of the Opposition is a liar, Mr Barron is a liar, former senator Graham Richardson is a liar, and the only person who tells the truth is Paul Keating. That is the substance of his position: Mr Packer is a liar; the Leader of the Opposition is a liar; Mr Barron is a liar; former senator Graham Richardson is a liar; and the only person who tells the truth is the Prime Minister. Well, who would want to be in a situation like that? And he knows it is false. He knows this was a smear which he himself walked into. If I were the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), I would be briefing him overtime right now. Send him back; make sure that you give him all the lines. People sometimes have to realise in life that they are not up to it, and this minister is one such person. It should be remembered that before he was appointed to the position of minister for communications he had that moment of self-realisation. He said, `I don't know that I'm up to it.' He said, `I don't know that I'm up to making tough decisions.' He said, `I'm not sure I have demonstrated yet that I'm good enough to be a minister handling difficult issues.' Let me tell you, old son: we're sure. We're absolutely sure that you have not demonstrated that you are a minister that can handle difficult issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made some inquiries of the Labor Party. I asked: `How is it that this minister became the minister for communications? How did he get the appointment?' Do you know what I was told? I was told that, if it had not been him, the minister for communications would have been David Beddall. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the frightening thing is that here is somebody who it was assumed would always be under adult supervision in that post&mdash;adult supervision from the Prime Minister himself. But, when the merchant of venom, the Prime Minister, took off on that flight to Singapore, to Bonn and to Hanover&mdash;to make his smears in Singapore, his abuse in Bonn and his claims in Hanover&mdash;it really reminded me of the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home Alone</EMPHASIS>. He left the minister for communications home alone, without adult supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that this minister has a great interest in the Australian film industry. In fact, from listening to him, one would think he just about directed, wrote and starred in the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Priscilla</EMPHASIS>. Actually, there is another movie coming up which has been made by Film Australia, in which they will offer him the star title role, to be called `Whoops, Mum, I shot my baby-sitter'. Here we have the minister for communications sitting in Australia, without adult supervision, trying to deal with these sorts of allegations and the best that he can do is echo&mdash;little Sir Echo&mdash;the allegations of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I move off his second role as minister for the arts, I just want to draw the attention of the House to the report of the Australian Children's Television Foundation for 1993-94. On the front cover is a group of children. One of them is wearing a fireman's hat. The one that is wearing the fireman's hat in fact is fireman Lee. It looks very much like the minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tragic thing is that the only thing he wanted to be when he grew up was a fireman, but Paul Keating made him minister for communications. That is the tragic thing. After all of the damage that you have done and all of the damage that you have attempted to do to the Leader of the Opposition, there is an opportunity for you to show your mettle. There is an opportunity for you to come in here and prove that you are up to ministerial office. There is an opportunity for you to show that you can be a minister. Sure, you may never be more than a mediocre, middle-of-the-road minister, but you could get there if you admitted the truth. All you have to say is, `There was no deal.' Each one of your statements has made it clear that you have no evidence. All you have to do is say, `I did not have the evidence.' All you have to do is say, `I have no information.' All you have to do is say, `I dug myself in because I was trying to defend the Prime Minister in relation to an unfounded allegation, and I apologise.' All you have to do is say, `I will from now on make my own judgments, be my own minister, be my own man and deal with policy.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Packer statement was what started the whole thing. The Prime Minister had to have, for his own conscience, some explanation as to how an independent businessman in this country would come to the conclusion that the Leader of the Opposition was honest&mdash;a conclusion that most of Australia has come to. It was not enough to talk about the need to change cross-media ownership rules. You made a specific allegation. It is an allegation that you are now walking away from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we know it is false and you know it is false. That is why you will not repeat it. How many times have we asked you to get up here and repeat it? You will have 20 minutes shortly. All I want to hear from you is this: the Prime Minister was told by a senior executive who holds the position of? His name is? On such and such a date he told the Prime Minister that the deal was? That media ownership laws would be changed in return for? That is all you have to say. If you fail to do that, you are effectively walking away from yourself. That is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we believe this is important? I will tell you why we believe this is important. We are sick of a Prime Minister who engages in smear and lie. We are sick of a Prime Minister who comes up with outrageous allegations, puts them out into the public domain, lets the smear stick, and before he can ever be harnessed with the truth moves on to the next one. It is the age old trick. You cannot catch up with the last smear because he is already on to the next one, and by the time you try to nail that one he has gone on to the one after that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Do you remember the performance that started all of this off on the Channel 9 program? I can remember it very well. I was mowing my lawn one Saturday afternoon when my wife said, `Mr Laurie Oakes is on the phone.' I got on the phone and Mr Oakes said, `I have just had a request from the Prime Minister who wants to knock you off the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program tomorrow because he has got something big to announce.' The Prime Minister went on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. Do you know what he announced? He made an announcement not in relation to the Leader of the Opposition, the state of the economy, the current account deficit, rising interest rates, the plight of home buyers or the gap between the rich and the poor. None of those things were on his mind. The only thing that was on his mind was this intense hatred that he has when people disagree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is more than that. This is not just about Kerry Packer; this is a determined effort by the Prime Minister to send a message to the businesses of Australia that anybody who dares to criticise him can expect government retribution. That is the bottom line of this campaign. If you are a big businessman like Kerry Packer you might be able to look after yourself, but if you are not, if you dare to stand up, if you dare to make some honest comments, if you dare to say `The emperor has no clothes', he says, `I will turn the full forces of my lie machine back on to you.' That is the bottom line of this campaign. That is the campaign of the merchant of venom who, for 12 years, has been practising smear, innuendo and lie. This has been the successive campaign over years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that program, he made one of the most unbelievable allegations you have ever heard in your life: Mr Kerry Packer was engaged in a scam in which Murray Farquhar attempted to take gold bars from the Philippines national bank. He is comparing Mr Packer to Murray Farquhar. It was not even the worst scam of Murray Farquhar. That might have been a bad scam of Murray Farquhar, but he was involved in one which was much worse. You know what it was too. Murray Farquhar's greatest scam was not trying to take gold bars out of the Philippines; Murray Farquhar's greatest scam was in August 1975 discharging one Laurie Brereton on bribery and conspiracy charges. That was his greatest scam. I can imagine Laurie Brereton when he came up over bribery charges on the Botany council and they said to him, `Murray's got the case. Wasn't that a lucky deal?' Murray Farquhar got the case, and that was the outcome in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did that have to do with media ownership laws? You tell me. What was the substance of that allegation? It came back, as you knew it would, to this persistent campaign. We are seeing it in relation to Mr Packer. We saw it in relation to Du Pont when it was reported on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. We have seen it from other employer groups. We saw it in relation to the HIA. We saw it in relation to the ACCI. This is a concerted campaign to blacken the name of anybody who dares stand up to the Prime Minister and his pretensions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy for you is that you have been caught up in the wake of this, little Sir Echo. The tragedy for you is that you have become part of this web of deceit. The tragedy for you is that, without adult supervision, you have been pulled in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the House the other day, why is it that the Prime Minister always accuses others of conspiring against him? Why is it that there is always a deal going on? I will tell you why: because this Prime Minister always accuses others of the standard of behaviour that he has himself. He could not conceive of the possibility that anybody could ever say a nice thing about a politician without having some quid pro quo. Why is that? Because nobody could say anything nice about the Prime Minister without some kind of quid pro quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about cross-media laws, you might actually deal with the allegations that are made in the Shawcross book. It was the Prime Minister who made the cross-media laws. It was the Prime Minister who just happened to deliver laws that created the same situation as Alan Ramsey reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 8 March 1995.

<PARA>Now we find that these cross-media rules are somehow designed to make sure that you do not get too much wealth or power or money. The fact was that they were orchestrated for the reverse. The fact was that the Prime Minister was the architect. The fact is that the Prime Minister made unfounded allegations. The fact is that you were caught up in them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me quote from the speech you made. Let me make it clearer from the speech you made in the Trade Practices Legislation (Amendment) Bill in 1992. This is what you said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal which is put by this Government in this Bill is a bad proposal. It is opposed by the Business Council, the Chamber of Commerce, the MTIA . . .</PARA>
<PARA>You finish by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is, of course, opposed by the Coalition.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet he goes on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program on Tuesday saying, `We've always said that we want strong anti-monopolistic laws always, always, always'. He is the man who was trying to ensure that the Trade Practices Commission would have no role whatsoever in mergers and takeovers such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is not alone in that because when the current Leader of the Opposition was Malcolm Fraser's Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, he was the person responsible for watering down the Trade Practices Act. He was the person responsible for lowering the test from a substantial lessening of competition to dominance. And this is the pair, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who did all they could to make sure that we had weak anti-monopolistic laws for the Trade Practices Commission. Yet he had the hide to go on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program and claim that this was the feather that he would use to protect himself and other Australians from Mr Packer's attempts to purchase the Fairfax newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what did Professor Allan Fels, the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, have to say about the opposition's claims that we could rely on the Trade Practices Act to stop Mr Packer buying Fairfax? This is an AAP release which came from the Trade Practices Commission yesterday. It is under the heading, `TPC could not stop Packer on Fairfax', and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A spokesman for the Trade Practices Commission said today that if the cross-media laws were removed, trade practices rules would not prevent Mr Packer owning a major newspaper and television interests in the same city.</PARA>
<PARA>So the proposal which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition are putting forward&mdash;that we can repeal the cross-media ownership laws and rely only on the Trade Practices Act, is a signal to Mr Packer, saying that the opposition believes that Mr Packer can own Channel 9 and the Fairfax newspapers as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition claims that there were very highly specific allegations made by me. I would like to remind the House of what I actually said on Monday. I said that I was aware of information that I believed linked the Leader of the Opposition to the allegations which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has put forward. At question time I said that that information came from the Packer camp and that I was told by them&mdash;that is, the Packer camp&mdash;that the Liberal Party had indicated that it would be prepared to support them and, if elected to government, would remove the cross-media ownership laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the government has been asking the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston to tell us what they have been saying to Mr Packer and his executives down there at Park Street. The golden rule in politics is: there is no such thing as a secret. If the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston are ringing Mr Packer's executives and telling them they would be prepared to support a relaxation of the rules, we think the public of Australia have a right to know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder we get suspicious when on eight occasions the Leader of the Opposition has been asked to tell us whether he will rule out allowing Mr Packer to purchase Fairfax because he now owns the Nine Network? On all of those occasions the Leader of the Opposition has refused to tell us whether he thinks it is undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on five occasions yesterday, also declined to say whether he thought it was undesirable for that to take place. So it is very clear that all the signals are there that the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston have told Mr Packer that they think it is okay for him to own Channel 9 and the Fairfax newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House think that is not a good thing. We think that cross-media ownership rules are there to promote diversity of ownership. We are not alone in thinking that. On Monday someone who was either impersonating the Leader of the Opposition or who looked a lot like him said, `I am strongly in favour of diversity'. That is what he said in his doorstop on Monday. Yet on 13 occasions the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have refused to tell us whether they think it is undesirable for Mr Packer to own Channel 9 and the Fairfax papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now come to looking at whether the Leader of the Opposition's claims have been consistent. In his contribution here today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition claimed that the views of the Leader of the Opposition have been genuinely held. They were genuinely held in 1987 when he told us that he thought the rules were unworkable; they were genuinely held when he said today that he thinks the cross-media ownership rules should be abolished. But we do not understand the doughnut in the middle&mdash;the petition he signed in 1991, where he said he was in favour of restricting Mr Packer from buying Fairfax. That is the thing we find difficult to understand. </PARA>

Yet on Monday he put out a press release that deliberately tried to mislead everyone concerned into thinking that his view had not changed since 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should all concentrate on what the Leader of the Opposition said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> last night. He was asked on three occasions whether he would rule out supporting Mr Packer purchasing the Fairfax newspapers. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported that appearance this morning under the heading `Cross-media rules: Howard may let Packer have it all'. Our view is that Mr Howard has told Mr Packer, `Cross-media rules: Howard will let Packer have it all.' That is our view. It can be ruled out simply by the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Alston telling us what they have said to Mr Packer and his executives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why will you not tell us whether or not you have given Mr Packer and his executives any reason to think that an incoming Howard government would in some way water down the cross-media ownership rules?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House we make it clear that we think the cross-media ownership rules carry out a very essential role in broadcasting policy. Given Senator Alston's stream of consciousness, it is not hard to find one or two press releases and comments from him saying that he supports a tightening of the rules, abolishing the rules, and a review of the rules. In fact, Senator Alston has put out so many press releases and given so many interviews on this issue that it is not hard to find him supporting every possible position that has been advocated. For that reason we think that the opposition has a few questions to answer. </PARA>

I welcome that, because it might give him a chance to answer a few questions. He might be able to tell us what he has in fact said to Mr Packer. The Leader of the Opposition might be able to tell us what Senator Alston has said to Mr Packer and his executives. Have Mr Howard and Senator Alston given the Packer camp any reason to think that a Howard government would support a relaxation of the cross-media ownership rules?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It passes strange that we in this House should have lectures about media policy from people who speak on behalf of the Prime Minister. If media policy in Australia is an unmitigated mess in 1995, it is the fault of one person more than anybody else: the Prime Minister of Australia. The Prime Minister of Australia is the proud author of the policy known as `You have to be either queen of the screen or prince of print'. The real code language is not that you have to be one thing or the other but that when the policy was devised it was devised with one sole objective in mind: to undermine, even destroy, the old Fairfax media empire and the Herald and Weekly Times empire. </PARA>

Paul Keating has done more to hand the media of this country over to foreigners and has done more to concentrate media ownership than any politician left standing in Australia. The last person who ought to have the nerve to raise media policy in this parliament is somebody who seeks to speak on behalf of the Prime Minister of Australia. It was the Prime Minister of Australia who told the former editorial manager, Max Suich, of the Fairfax media empire in the late 1980s how much he hated the Fairfax newspapers and how much he was bent on destroying them. </PARA>

In the middle of it, with that great capacity for spotting humbug and isolating what somebody was up to, John Button said, `Hey, Bob, will you tell us which of your media mates you are trying to help so we'll know what you want us to do?'

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Leader of the Opposition spoke in this debate, he discussed cross-media ownership rules, foreign ownership rules and media policy generally. Throughout his speech, he failed to refer to not only current opposition policies but past opposition policies. After hearing the Leader of the Opposition debate the issues that surrounded the decisions last decade&mdash;changes to the ownership rules to separate ownership of the electronic media from ownership of the print media&mdash;a reasonable person would think that his remarks indicate that the opposition stood in diametrical opposition to us on those particular propositions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They supported us. They supported us on changes we put in place at the time. They merely said that they had some vague concerns about them, but their concerns did not go to the opportunity to establish a network in television&mdash;which was the basic element of the electronic media one, apart from the cross-media ownership rules at the time. They did not oppose that proposition. In so far as they had any difficulties with it at all, they had difficulties with whether or not you could move from owning one or two stations in major metropolitan centres around the country to owning any number of them. Then they had doubts as to whether you ought to be excluded from the print media in those centres at the same time. That was the area of their doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if you listened to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, you would think that he stood here as a devotee of diversity. You would think that the government had somehow failed in its task to ensure diversity, and that that was the reason the government&mdash;among others&mdash;should be censured for its longstanding media policies in this area. That happens not to be true. The only thing consistent about the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to these matters is his vagueness. He has been vague when he was taken to task by the press on what his policies now happen to be. He was vague then. The media release he re-released earlier this week is such a typical opposition presentation on media policy that it is worth recounting. The style of presentation has not changed over the years. The basic thrust is, `For God's sake, do not force us to commit ourselves in any detailed fashion on anything related to media policy. Please let us stand around the place, shouting out that the government's policy is a mess but, for God's sake, do not tie us down.' The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition sees merit in the Government's proposal to removing the existing two-station rule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, we are disposed to support the Government's proposal and that any television network should have the right to reach 75 per cent of the viewing audience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However we should be looking carefully at the report of the Senate Select Committee, established at the initiative of the Opposition, as we are particularly keen to ensure that the introduction of the 75 per cent rule does not unfairly disadvantage regional television stations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition also believes that as part and parcel of the removal of the two-station rule and the introduction of the 75 per cent principle there should be a removal of the existing barriers to entry into both television and radio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is those opposite supporting the ability to set up a television network in this country. But where did they have a problem with it? They came to a problem on this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of cross-media ownership we are not convinced that the prohibitions proposed by the Government are either necessary or can be justified.</PARA>
<PARA>So the official position of the opposition was at that stage: you could have a network and you could own newspapers in all the areas where you had that network. He hates a reference to history when it is a reference to history that deals with himself. He loves a reference to history when he thinks it makes a point about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That is the first point that you would make about the Leader of the Opposition. Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policies encourage foreign ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an interesting fact in the 1991 document&mdash;which I will get to a bit later&mdash;about a petition he signed adopting a policy that he said he had never espoused. That petition, even though it was a matter of debate at the time, contains no reference to foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a specific reason why it contains no mention of foreign ownership. That was that whilst there was a substantial amount of bipartisan unity, I have to say, having been on the receiving end of a lobbying about it as a minister in the portfolio at the time, on defending the cross-media ownership rules that they previously opposed, there was no bipartisanship on the subject of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was there no bipartisanship on the subject of foreign ownership? For this reason: the government was supportive of putting limitations on it; the opposition was not. Whatever level of foreign ownership has been achieved, and whether or not you regard that level of foreign ownership as suitable or as contrary to the national interest, if the opposition had had policy control at that point in time, it would have been greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the style of argument of the person who wants to be regarded as a man of great integrity in this place, the Leader of the Opposition. You make an accusation about the government, you attack it from both the left and the right and you hope to God nobody reviews your history. If he does review your history, you get up around the gallery and inform them of what it is that you think that they are up to, trying to obfuscate the defence of themselves or whatever by the propositions they put. He is being very free in this debate and out in the public forum with his accusations of lying. He has, nevertheless, produced a statement at the beginning of this week which was an out and out lie. That was actually picked up, funnily enough&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not use it again, Mr Speaker, which was not a requirement placed upon the Leader of the Opposition. I just use it that once and now illustrate the point further. It was a very interesting interview the other night on Ray Martin's show. In the same way as he should not have entered this debate, he ought not to have gone on Ray Martin's show last night, because Ray Martin, who is a good interviewer, had the integrity to go through with him his 1991 position as opposed to his 1987 position, which was about as vague as you could have put it but did actually emerge at the end of the day as being one of opposition to cross-media ownership rules. So we will give him what he said back in 1987, even though by very tortuous logic he finally arrived at opposition to the ownership rules. Nevertheless, in 1991 he was absolutely clear cut. The transcript states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Martin: Now what about the suggestion today in Parliament by Kim Beazley that you've flip-flopped. That in fact you were a party to a petition in 1991 that called for tougher rules?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard: Well, that was the Opposition's policy at that particular time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>even though he had said privately and publicly that he had been devoted to a looser cross-media ownership rule&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Martin: But you signed that petition?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard: Well, I wasn't the Leader of the Opposition then, and I wasn't the spokesman on communications and I went along as a team player, I went along with the Opposition's situation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is all right to sling around accusations about the Prime Minister, that he is a man without integrity and tells lies. But we now know the criteria by which John Howard is prepared to mislead the public as to his point of view. He will be prepared to mislead the public as to his point of view when he is not the spokesman on communications; when he is not the Leader of the Opposition; when he is a team player; and when he goes along with the opposition situation. We now know the price tag that is placed by the Leader of the Opposition on his personal integrity as far as that is concerned. I would say it is a pretty diverse caveat on the requirement for him to tell the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that is consistent about the opposition position is the slipping and the sliding. There has been a slipping and a sliding on this. The Leader of the Opposition says, `Oh, no, I do not have any particular deal in this situation. I go along and have a couple of chats. In the course of those couple of chats I reveal that I have informed Mr Packer that my position privately and publicly is that which it was back in 1987.' Smarm, smarm. He says, `It is no problem as far as I am concerned. I don't agree with the prince of print and the queen of screen and all the rest of it. I never have, except when he bid last time as part of the Tourang consortium in 1991 for Fairfax. Then I was opposed to it. So I do have something to explain. I just want to give you my assurance, Sir, that that little dereliction on my part was due to the fact that I wasn't Leader of the Opposition at the time; I was not the spokesman on communications. I went along as a team player. I went along with the opposition's situation. So please ignore that, Sir, and remember that back in 1987 I would have given you the lot. But please don't support me. Please don't get out there on your channels and say anything nice about me. No, please don't do that; just be absolutely clear that I have crawfished away from that terrible position that I took on the Tourang bid. I beg your forgiveness. We don't have any conspiracy going, do we? There is no special pleading here.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a gutless, snivelling, crawling performance that is. Then he has a little difficulty because somebody wants to ask him to sharpen up in his policy area and to say something a bit straightforward about all this. So he is finally brought down. When asked, `Tell us what you would do. You sort of said you were with him back in 1987,' he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very strongly in favour of diversity and it's worth saying that the man who's done more to concentrate foreign ownership and single proprietor ownership, of the Australian media is Paul Keating.</PARA>
<PARA>Another question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But do you think it is undesirable?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Howard replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's undesirable to have too heavier concentration in anything, whether it's newspapers, television or the lot, but I don't think it's desirable to personalise it, I think you have to have rules and principles. He was then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But do you think there should be a rule, do you agree that there should be some sort of rule to avoid the ownership of a major newspaper in a city and one  of the major television networks?</PARA>
<PARA>He replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there should be a rule to prevent too much concentration of ownership and the question of whether you best do it by a specific rule or whether you do it in some other way was the essence of what I said back in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>Absolute bulldust! He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what I'm trying to get at, is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>to which Mr Howard said:</PARA>

<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is desirable to have as much diversity as possible.</PARA>
<PARA>In answer to another question, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well it would depend on the size of the market and how you define the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, fair dinkum: you are a very lucky man. The press has let you lot off the hook on this one during this week. When it comes to a particular policy debate, you have been jumping up and down on both sides of this issue, desperately trying to arrive at a conclusion, but with one underlying theme: `We shall bow at the altar of whoever it is who might provide us with a useful level of political support. If those folk are around, we will apologise for past attitudes that we have taken on this matter which may have had cause to give grievous offence. And if those past attitudes are pointed out to us in a way that makes us look like we are a pack of liars, without integrity, as we slither into our hollows on this one, we will explain it by the fact that we had no official responsibilities at the time and we were just going along with the mob.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition, at the end of the day, never learns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He started by making a point about how many times they had censured the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), which was pathetic in itself. That was his opening point. He then got the amendment wrong and had to change tack on that. He then ran out of time. He filled his 15 minutes with nothing but bluster. It really demonstrates the case which is the censure motion against the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Minister for Communications and the Arts: if we look at his ashen faced complexion, you know, and we know that you know, there was no deal. The minister and I were sworn in together in this place in early 1985. I have been watching him for some time. I suppose it is fair to say that his rise in the Labor Party has been largely uninterrupted. The Labor Party has been in office and he has been able to ride in on the coat-tails of others to assume now the high office of minister for communications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 10 years I think there are a couple of lessons that he ought to have learnt about politics. The first thing is that a lot of people think that politics is a game. It is true that politics has many of the characteristics of a game. It has the rough and tumble of a game. It has the theatre of a game. From time to time you have the professional free kick taken by one side, whilst breaking the rules, to still give their side a benefit. That is accepted when you are playing a game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is that this is not a game. Yes, it has the characteristics of a game but politics is no game. I think that when we look into your face, minister, you realise that simple fact. When you set out deliberately, maliciously and without justification to smear, when you set out to conspire with others&mdash;and, in particular, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;to attack the reputation of another and impugn the integrity of a member of this House, doing so in a baseless and malicious way, you damage your own reputation. The Leader of the Opposition is not damaged by this; you are the one who is damaged by this. Sure, you are going to use your numbers and knock off our censure motion. You will put through your silly amendment. But the reality is, minister, that this damage is damage that you will incur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand why. You owe your place in political life to the Prime Minister. He is your promoter. Just as he knelt at the knee of Jack Lang and learned the tricks of the trade of the New South Wales Right, you sit on the knee of the Prime Minister and learn the lessons of politics from him. As you consider your political career, you think that you owe him; but I would say to you, minister&mdash;and this is the second lesson for you&mdash;that you are a young bloke compared with the Prime Minister. In fact, the Prime Minister has been here a long time. I do not think he will be here that much longer. You are 37 years old, you are a very young fellow&mdash;in fact, you are very young by your actions as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that your reputation will ultimately be built not on the fact that you have been able to hang onto the skirts of the Prime Minister but on the basis of your actions in this place. You might think that your reputation is one that is built only on what your colleagues think of you, but you are wrong. Ultimately, if you are going to have a reputation in this place, it will be a reputation that rests on the opinions of everybody in this House&mdash;even people on our side of this House. We will not forget this malicious, nasty, little smear campaign that you have been running and, ultimately, your reputation will be based on what sort of person you are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the Prime Minister say the other day&mdash;and it is a classic Keating quote&mdash;`If I were Howard, I'd have had a plan that would drive me mad.' The way the Prime Minister is going on, we do not need a plan because he is pretty mad already&mdash;absolutely mad. He will not be here much longer, minister. So you will have to stand on your own two feet and build your own reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You work on the basis of the philosophy you have learnt from the New South Wales Right, which is: say anything and do anything. It is a sort of `whatever it takes' philosophy.

It is bizarre in that you guys start with a proposition that there is a secret deal but, when we put the heat on you for the evidence, your evidence consists of the public comments of the Leader of the Opposition. I will come back to the comments you made on Monday night in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It was interesting to hear that your defence today was based on the Leader of the Opposition's remarks last night on television. Perhaps it is a good try on your part, but the reality is that the charge against you is that you set out maliciously to smear the Leader of the Opposition. That is the charge you have got to answer, and you have dismally failed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If it were simply a matter of a disagreement about coalition policy, then I would remind you that, on that basis, we would be mounting a similar argument against Mr Keating. Mr Keating himself has said that really he questions the ongoing relevance of the cross-media ownership because of the way in which technology is changing. I reckon that allegation would have a hell of a lot more credit if it came from us. Do you know why? Because if anybody has ever done deals in this country, it is you blokes, not us. It is amazing. You go all the way back to 1987 and get stuck into John Howard, but the fact is that, if you go back to what John Howard said in 1987 on the public record, Kerry Packer was backing you guys, not us&mdash;and said so publicly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to this with clean hands. This whole thing started off with one simple statement&mdash;with Kerry Packer expressing the views that most Australians have&mdash;that is, that John Howard is a pretty decent, honest bloke and he is not a bad alternative Prime Minister.

This is what you said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I along with a number of other people are certainly aware of information which we believe links Mr Howard to the allegations which the Prime Minister has put forward.</PARA>
<PARA>You furthermore said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ah, well, I think that the claim that the evidence is only circumstantial is based on a claimed knowledge as to who might have passed on the information to the Prime Minister. If the person who passed on the information to the Prime Minister was in a position to know, then I think it's pretty firm evidence.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And you believe they were in a position to know?</PARA>
<PARA>Your answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Absolutely.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty clear statement. That is a very clear statement that you had evidence as to whom, as to when and as to the detail. The reality is that you have not. The whole week, Minister, we have provided you with opportunities. We have asked you the what of this allegation; we have asked you the when of this allegation; and we have asked you the who of this allegation&mdash;who was it that provided the information? At every opportunity, you have walked away from the question. You did not even have the guts to front up to question time yesterday. You were up there watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sesame Street</EMPHASIS> and having afternoon tea. We had a division after question time and, lo and behold, here you were. You have failed to respond to this charge on every occasion it has been brought up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us put the whole thing in context. What do we have here? We have nothing other than a political campaign on your part. Minister, you have been brought up in a school of politics which thinks it is smart to run a smear campaign. You think that this is the way in which good public policy is conducted. The reality is that it ain't. It is a serious allegation. You work on the basis that mud sticks. Well, this is mud that ain't going to stick, Minister. This is a campaign we intend to and do repel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, of course, act in conjunction with the Prime Minister, and he is a master of the smear campaign. You think that you can profit by it, but if you look at it you will see that what we have is a situation where the Prime Minister attempts to hold on to his office by the use of a smear campaign. In doing so, he demeans the office of Prime Minister. It is no wonder that there is a cynicism about Australian politics that has developed in the last 10 years when people like you and the Prime Minister act in the way you do&mdash;in a malevolent way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, you have two simple choices. Your first choice is to substantiate your claim. We have given you repeated opportunities to do so. Instead, you and Mr Keating have repeated the claim. Your second choice is to salvage some credibility for what you have had to say. That would be to stand here and to admit that you have no evidence and to apologise, not only to the Leader of the Opposition but to the House generally, for the fact that you have waged a campaign for a week now on baseless, unsubstantiated allegations. Minister, I say to you that a glimpse of decency, a whiff of honesty, might give you that chance to salvage. I do not expect you to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that you deserve to be censured. Why do you deserve to be censured? You deserve to be censured because you lied. It is as simple as that. You have lied to this House, and you have lied to the Australian people. I think you also deserve to be censured because you have slavishly repeated the lies of others, and you have done so knowingly. There has never been any doubt in your mind, has there, Minister? Let us face it. There has never been any doubt in your mind whatsoever that this whole thing was a malicious smear campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, Minister, you deserve censure not just for the fact that you lied, not just for the fact that you slavishly repeated the Prime Minister's lies but for your political incompetence in putting your own reputation in the hands of somebody like Keating. That is what you have done: you have put your own reputation in the hands of someone like Keating. And, I tell you, he won't be grateful, Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, he is off on one of his European jaunts. He is off there in Berlin about to enjoy the sights. I think as we rise and go home to our electorates, it is 11 a.m. and an early start for the Prime Minister, who will be off doing the sights of Berlin with the Mayor of Berlin, offering and pressing home his own ideas for improvements to the Berlin streetscape. That is a pretty busy day for him because then after that he will have 4 1/2 hours of rest in which to prepare himself for the gruelling main event of the day, dinner at the Schloss Charlottenberg hosted by the same unfortunate mayor who can look forward to his lecturing on Berlin streetscapes during the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst he is doing that, Minister, you will be reading the comment pieces that state that basically, you are a liar; you do not tell the truth; you are just a little Sir Echo in a malicious, grubby campaign to impugn the reputation of someone who has worked hard and, with justification, has a good reputation in this place.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MARTIN: How many times would you have spoken to Mr Packer in the last month?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOWARD: In the last month I spoke to Mr Packer briefly on the phone, a couple of weeks after I became Leader of the Opposition, and I had one meeting with him subsequently to that, and the question of the Opposition's media policy was not raised at that discussion.</PARA>
<PARA>No talk, of course, about how many conversations he may or may not have had with him before he became Leader of the Opposition; but I will leave that to one side&mdash;we know what Senator Alston said in respect of that matter. Mr Martin goes on with a subsequent question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now what about the suggestion today in Parliament by Kim Beazley that you flip-flopped. That in fact you were a party to a petition in 1991 that called for tougher rules?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOWARD: Well that was the Opposition's policy at that particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MARTIN: But you signed that petition?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOWARD: Well, I wasn't the Leader of the Opposition then, and I wasn't the spokesman on communications and I went along as a team player, I went along with the Opposition's situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MARTIN: But that's a petition again&mdash;October 24, 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>And this very revealing interview goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MARTIN: Well, let's shoot straight.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it would have been nice if we had had a straight answer last night from the Leader of the Opposition. And he could have solved all this today by giving a straight answer in the course of this debate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should Kerry Packer be allowed to own Channel 9 and the Fairfax group?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOWARD: Well, I don't think you should deal with these things&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;on the basis of personalities.</PARA>
<PARA>We know why he does not want to deal with it on the basis of personalities. We know why he does not want to deal with it on the basis of the cross-media ownership rules. We know why he does not want to deal with it on the basis of the policies. Because we know he has done a deal with the personality&mdash;that is why. Mr Martin goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should any man then? Let's forget personalities. Any man or woman should they own a television network in Australia and also the major publishing group?  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a very perceptive question from Mr Martin&mdash;it goes right to the heart of the policy. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOWARD: Well, it depends entirely on what the other players in all of the media markets are. It depends on a whole range of factors. I'm not going to say yes or no to that question. Why should I?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the precise question to which he should say yes or no because that goes right to the heart of media policy. And he won't say yes or no because we know he has not put his mind to the policy&mdash;he has done a deal with the personality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the Leader of the Opposition had to do today was to come into this House and say, `We've all had allegations made against us before.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, Mr Peter Reith, said that the calculations show that Labor would be treading water on employment.</PARA>

<PARA>So that was the formal view of the opposition at the time we made our commitment. That target has now been bettered, and in two years rather than three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are some of the key characteristics of the figures released today? As I said, total employment growth since April 1993 is now 560,000.

I was very intrigued to see an extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 7 September 1985. It was a most pertinent cartoon on John Howard. Little Johnny Howard is doing a doorstop and in the Petty cartoon he is quoted as saying, `I would be less than loyal, honest, open and frank if I didn't admit my policies favour the rich, big, merciless and devious.'  All Mr Howard had to do on the Ray Martin show last night was say yes or no. All he had to do in the House today was say yes or no. He failed or refused to do either.

However, as the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) correctly pointed out, there is one central core issue. It is: where is the evidence? If there is no evidence, there is no deal. Where are the actual documents supporting the matter? Where are the telephone transcripts? Where are the statutory declarations?

On that score, this minister stands absolutely condemned for his total failure to produce one shred of evidence to back up his insulting accusations of an honest Leader of the Opposition, honest John Howard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate today, and statements from members of the opposition over the past four months, prove that they will say anything, do anything, think anything and do any deal to slime their way back into power. There is no doubt that this has been a Goebbels type campaign by the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and members of the front bench over there to turn themselves from hard Right ideologues into soft, furry, fuzzy, kind social democrats. But nobody believes you. You came into this House today and asked, `Where's your evidence?' We are guilty because we do not have the evidence that you have done a deal with Kerry Packer! What sort of logic is that? You have done the deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Ray Martin show last night your leader, the member for Bennelong, said that he was prepared to change the cross-media ownership rules. That is the evidence. Let us look at the deals you have done in recent times. Let us look at the backflips that have taken place in recent times. It took the member for Bennelong seven years to apologise for his remarks on Asian immigration. Who can believe him? It is not what you say; it is what you think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next election is going to be some sort of mind-reading exercise when it comes to the opposition. No-one is going to believe what you say about Asian immigration. No-one is going to believe what you say about public spending. Nobody is going to believe what you say about the social security safety net. Nobody is going to believe what you say about industrial relations. They all know that Fightback is what you believe in&mdash;it is your bible. Every time we ask you what your current policy is you say, `Fightback doesn't count any more, but we're not going to tell you what our policy is now.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition said to Ray Martin last night, `Ray, I'm not going to tell you. Let's not get into personalities.' I agree.

It is very clear where you stand: you are going to water them down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear where you stand. You have reached a deal with Mr Packer. You are going to junk the cross-media ownership rules, and you are going to do or say anything in a very grubby attempt to win votes at the next election. It will not work.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) and the puppeteer of the Liberal Party, the person who pulls the strings on the opposition front bench, Mr Ron Walker, the person who funds the Liberal Party, the person who pays the piper, the person who gives $30 million a year to the Liberal Party, the person who is probably setting up offshore funding for the Liberal Party in South Australia and the person who is behind your attempts to avoid the disclosure legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, there has been a specific impact on the Albury-Wodonga area. This area is receiving the signal from Sydney for the period of the New South Wales elections. As a result of the time difference between New South Wales and Victoria, the rebroadcast of question time is now at 2.00 a.m. rather than 1.00 a.m.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the management and treatment of breast cancer</EMPHASIS>, my first purpose is to offer my congratulations for this report to the community affairs subcommittee chaired by the member for Brand (Ms Fatin). It is important to point out that she and her four colleagues on the subcommittee received 192 submissions, which indicates the level of interest in this issue around Australia. They held 12 days of public hearings. I took some time to attend one of those and certainly found it quite fascinating and, of course, of extreme importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry follows a report tabled in August of last year on home and community care. In both cases, we found that the Australian community, both professionally and at a personal level, is very willing and very eager to respond to parliamentarians and the parliament when they are given the chance to. The high level of interest and open-mindedness that we find in these inquiries is most welcome. What also comes through is that as a country we have a very high level of skill. When we do something well, we do it very, very well, and we certainly rank amongst world leaders. But what seems to occur in breast cancer treatment, as in many other issues, is that we do not do it the same all over. Whilst we may do it well in one part of the country, we appear not to have learnt how to spread that best practice, that skill, across the whole country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation Australia has long understood the tyranny of distance and the inequalities caused by our geographic dispersion, so I suppose many of us had thought that with modern communication technology and all those things we would have shrunk those differences and lessened them. What this inquiry shows is that women throughout Australia do get varying levels of treatment and service depending on where they live. That is a matter that I am sure is of concern to the parliament and to all of us. Yet at the same time the people offering the advice, and certainly the professionals, going on the evidence of the medical professions and the various individuals that took part, made very clear their willingness to actually participate in improving the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted also some comments from the staff from the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), expressing some concern about the report. I think it is often wise for people to take time to read these reports and look at them closely and thoughtfully rather than succumb to the pressure of the media to respond at the moment they are released. We know what happens. The report comes out and the media scan it, look for a few controversial words here and there, and instantly look for a response. Most of us who have been around a while tend to recognise that that is the worst time to respond, and I have no doubt that when the minister and her department look at this report closely they will come back with very positive responses to it, because I think it certainly is a very worthwhile report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said my purpose this morning was to place on record the appreciation of both myself and the rest of the committee for the work of the member for Brand and her colleagues who carried out this inquiry, and for the report they have presented. I also want to point out that the committee has actually re-established the subcommittee that conducted the inquiry, so they will in fact continue some of their work. From our point of view, to produce the report is extremely important but it is not the end of the process, and we want to develop methods and ideas and ways in which the report itself becomes an active vehicle for testing ideas and getting people to look further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the government is required to respond to the report in the three-month period. Between now and then, it is expected that the subcommittee will continue to be active and will consult with the community and the professions. In that process, the subcommittee will try to ensure that the report is seen as an active, vibrant document and not something that has been tabled and then pigeonholed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular role has been one that we have been testing and trying to develop. In the area of social policy, as I said, the reporting process is only one stage. I offer my personal congratulations on behalf of the committee to the honourable member for Brand, to the subcommittee and to the staff who helped, particularly Julie from the department, who assisted in the drafting. I support the motion that the Main Committee take note of the paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was around this time last year&mdash;in fact it was one year ago yesterday&mdash;that the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson, launched the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Beat breast cancer: lobby for life</EMPHASIS> kit. This was funded by the Hancock Family Breast Cancer Foundation in Perth. The kit was widely supported by many thousands of people throughout Australia, men and women. It is interesting to note that, despite the fact that 99 per cent of patients suffering from breast cancer are women, this issue, Australia wide, has certainly had the support of men and women. No doubt that is because not only are the patients traumatised but their entire families are often also traumatised by this disease.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative that John Hewson launched last year resulted in almost 100,000 signatures from people all over this country to endeavour to increase funding for breast cancer research. The petition deplored the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and noted that the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in 12 for Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition also recognised the fact that breast cancer has the potential to affect every Australian family. It noted and recognised that there were inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer and the petitioners asked that the government increase funding and, in addition to that, consider further initiatives to encourage private donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that particular time, Dr Hewson wrote a letter to include in the kit. Many thousands of the kits were circulated around the country. I do not wish to read the whole of Dr Hewson's letter, but I would like to read the final paragraph. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Collectively, the men and women of Australia have a powerful voice. I believe it should be heard. The facts about breast cancer in this country are a national disgrace and it is up to all of us as Australians to act. In this, the International Year of the Family, we have an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to families. What could be more important for a family than to insist on Government action to support the health and well-being of Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>The hard cold facts about breast cancer have been well highlighted in this report, and I would like to recap on some of those points. Breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in women. Forty per cent of women who get breast cancer die from the disease. There is no known cause of breast cancer. There has been a rising incidence of breast cancer and it is now the most common cause of death for Australian women aged 25 to 44. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Breast cancer affects one in 12 Australian women. Over 6,000 women per year are diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia. That means that one woman dies every four hours in this country, and six women die every day. About 2,500 women die from breast cancer each year. On present trends, over the next 10 years another 30,000 Australian women will die of breast cancer. There is quite an extensive list of facts which, when one starts to delve into them, are quite alarming. The alarming point is that very little was being done to address this issue and to make funding available for research, diagnosis, treatment and after care treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that nearly 100,000 Australians signed a petition which was presented to the Australian parliament and that the government did act was a victory for democracy. It goes to show that, when ordinary Australians become involved in the processes of this place, we can actually move mountains and get places. I see that as a great victory for democracy in this country: the power of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that petition was presented to the parliament, a number of things happened. The government announced in the women's budget statement for 1994-95 the following measures:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1994-95, the screening program will form the basis of a new comprehensive national Breast Cancer Program. It is important to widen our focus and to address the treatment issues that are one of the most pressing concerns of women with breast cancer. It is also important to keep up Australia's research effort on this disease. The new Breast Cancer Program will therefore have two new elements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A National Breast Cancer Centre which will be set up under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). It will analyse Australian and overseas research, seek medical consensus on the best treatment practices, provide accessible information on treatment and other issues to doctors and patients, and assist development of support services. The Centre will also be a clear, single information point for doctors, women and the broader public, about all aspects of breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA>After that petition was presented, the government set aside, as per the 1994-95 budget, a total of $16.4 million for the centre and its associated activities over a four-year period, so that meant $2.5 million for this particular budget. In addition, the government announced a measure to set up a breast cancer foundation, with this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Breast Cancer Foundation will be set up to raise funds, particularly from the private sector, to support basic and applied breast cancer research, particularly research relating to practical treatment and information for women. The Commonwealth will provide $3m over three years to establish the Foundation, and in the next three years, will also match up to $1m a year in private donations.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly applaud the small progress that has been made in terms of the funding, but I have to say that I was very disappointed that the government saw fit to spend $3 million setting up a new foundation when, in this country, we already have several credible foundations. I would have thought that the $3 million might have gone a long way towards helping to fund many of the initiatives that have been recommended in this report. I am deeply disappointed about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are several institutions&mdash;including, as I said before, the Hancock Family Breast Cancer Foundation, in my state&mdash;whose charter is to raise public funds to help to research and to improve the treatment and ongoing care of breast cancer patients. We have a number of foundations already, so why would we allocate $3 million to setting up a new foundation and all the costs associated with the administration of that? I fail to understand the logic in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the member for Brand (Ms Fatin) on her dedication&mdash;she has done an incredible amount of work&mdash;and my colleague the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), who has also put in an immense effort in this matter. The member for Brand, along with others, moved this agenda forward in November 1993. That was when the then minister for health, Senator Richardson, decided that this inquiry ought to take place, following on the heels of a Senate inquiry which had begun to look at the screening process. This inquiry went well beyond that reference and looked at the broader aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report on the management and treatment of breast cancer is quite comprehensive. I congratulate all the members of the committee and the secretariat for the tremendous work they have done. One can only hope that this important document does not become a relic on library shelves and that those who have been so committed to getting the report up would now have the same commitment to seeing some or all of its recommendations adopted. Importantly, a clear focus on the issue has been maintained. I agree with my colleague the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) that reports such as this need to be considered in detail, particularly with regard to where the priorities lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly heartened to read the recommendations in relation to people in rural and remote areas of Australia. Those patients live well beyond the treatment centres of urban Australia and have difficulties not only in having to face a terrible and devastating disease but also because of isolation, remoteness and accessing ongoing treatment and primary treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the summary of the report because some good points were made. In the preliminary observations section of the report it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A considerable volume of evidence has been gathered by the Committee which shows that women who have not had access to specialist, multidisciplinary care have been disadvantaged in terms of receiving "best practice" management and treatment for breast cancer. Those at greatest disadvantage in accessing such multidisciplinary care are some women from rural and remote areas, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, and women from non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA>I am particularly pleased to see that this has been a focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also read with interest the submission by the daughter of a woman living in remote and rural Australia. That submission highlighted not only the problem for the patients but also the grave difficulties for families trying to offer support services. So there is little doubt that women from rural and remote areas face additional trauma because of the difficulty of accessing primary and ongoing treatment and counselling. The submission from Danielle Kelly highlighted the difficulties in giving families of cancer patients in rural and remote areas the support that they need. I hope also that the recommendations to broaden and standardise the travel assistance schemes and the provision of child care will be amongst some of the urgent matters to be addressed in this bill, given the special difficulties of women in rural and remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which I hope the committee will get behind and push with a very great degree of urgency is the matter of mammary prosthesis. It is nothing short of scandalous that women in Australia cannot obtain a rebate from Medicare for mammary prosthesis, and I note that the committee has put a degree of urgency on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many issues raised in this report which have great weight and which deserve considerable attention. As I said, I would like to congratulate all of those who have been involved in this report on the management and treatment of breast cancer, and I look forward to seeing some positive action to forward some of these recommendations and to get legislation in place to make sure that some of the anomalies currently in the system are addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very proud to stand here as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs and support the motion that the House take note of its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the management and treatment of breast cancer</EMPHASIS>. I also take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee and on the subcommittee that dealt with this subject for allowing me to be part of the investigation, because it was an area that I was particularly interested in when I came into this House. In fact, in October 1993, I made a speech in the House following a comment from the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who, incidentally, ended up on this particular committee and took an interest in it. He had made the comment, in October 1993, that it was nothing short of irresponsible that, in his words, mammography  was `demeaning and painful' for the woman who was being tested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our mammography units, the technical competence and expertise of those involved is incredibly high. It is an expertise that has been built up from worldwide experience. Standing here approximately three weeks after having my last mammography test, I would like to suggest that it is far better that women experience a small amount of discomfort under this quality procedure than that they live with the thought&mdash;as many women in Australia do&mdash;that they may have breast cancer and are too frightened to do anything about it. I am quite happy to experience that small amount of discomfort if only to have that moment of receiving a letter, as I did last Friday, which says that it is all clear. It is by no means demeaning to me as a woman or, I am sure, to any other woman. Peace of mind is far more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that I made that speech on 21 October 1993 and, as we have heard already, my colleague beside me here, the honourable member for Brand, pushed this issue to the forefront in November 1993. Often these things happen because of the dedication of those who are interested. All the members of the committee were extremely interested in this subject and that is why we members&mdash;from both sides of this House&mdash;dedicated so much time to pursuing this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is very detailed and I would like to talk  about four areas that, to my mind, are of specific interest. One of the recommendations in the report is about the need for education in three areas: education for undergraduates, for postgraduates, and for those in general practice. Throughout our deliberations, we saw the possibility that, in those areas, there was not quite enough education. In the undergraduate area, the committee recommended that medical schools examine their curricula, as a matter of urgency, with a view to initiating courses which will enable their undergraduates to access information about diagnosis, management and treatment of cancer, with particular reference to breast cancer. Attention must be given to educating undergraduates, especially about the emotional and psychosocial context within which patients must deal with their malignant diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as my personal experience of twice in my life having undergone a mammography and the three-week waiting period, I have now had the experience of listening to women throughout Australia who have had breast cancer. I know what they have to deal with, in their minds, on this subject. There is very much a need for the practitioners who are dealing with the women of Australia to understand our feelings when we are faced with the possibilities of breast cancer. And that comes right down to our general practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I approached a general practitioner back in 1991 or 1992 on this subject because I was concerned. The male practitioner said, `Look, don't worry about it, I am sure there's nothing wrong.' That was not what I expected from a GP. I expected a little more understanding. Six or seven weeks ago I approached my general practitioner&mdash;I now have a woman&mdash;on a similar issue, and she said, `Let's have a look at the mammogram and see if there's a problem,' and she talked me through it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When I made my appointment to have my mammogram it was an interesting experience. I would like to relate it to the women of Australia. Last October I made a speech in which I mentioned that a unit had opened in Launceston in the previous July. I had not been there until a few weeks ago. If all the units around Australia are similar to the one in Launceston, the women of Australia should not fear having a mammogram. It was the most genteel atmosphere for that type of service that I have ever experienced in my life&mdash;a life that has been reasonably lengthy compared with others in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women of Australia should not be afeard. Often women of Australia are afeard of the next area I would like to speak about, that is, information&mdash;or, I suggest, lack of information. Recommendation No. 29 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that women be provided by practitioners with written information about breast cancer to which they and their families can refer repeatedly. The information should be written to meet the differing needs of individuals by encompassing approaches which range from the purely supportive to the medically sophisticated.</PARA>
<PARA>The women of Australia are diverse. One extra area we need to tag onto is how we get information to women from non-English speaking backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a broad range of areas where we need to get information to Australian women. The member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) mentioned the dissemination of information to rural women. We discovered that the rural women are disenfranchised in some areas and are not gaining a lot of knowledge in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must provide information to the women of Australia. That came out time and time again throughout our deliberations. Women of Australia want the information to be in a written form so that it can be read by women or, in the case of non-English speaking women, by members of their family or friends. They need the information at their fingertips so that it can be disseminated to them at a suitable time. Often information is given at the time of diagnosis. That is the time when women can become spaced out, and may I suggest that men in similar circumstances might too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When faced with a crisis or a trauma in life, people do not take in necessary information in a concise form. One may only get bits and pieces of it. We must be looking towards providing information that can be kept within reach of family members, as well as the person receiving the diagnosis, so that they can read it at their convenience and when their minds come to terms with the issue they are facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, when disseminating information we must disseminate it prior to diagnosis. When I walked in the door of the breast cancer mammography screening unit in Launceston I was met by a very friendly receptionist who asked me to complete a form and read a piece of information. That information detailed, in a very gentle form, what I was going to undergo. Had I been going for my first mammography, that would have been terrific. I already knew what I was going for. In this instance I was having it in one of our units, as opposed to having it in a normal X-ray unit where I had been before. The women there had been specifically and specially trained to disseminate this information to other women. It was done in such a way that, in the half hour or so I spent there, I did not feel demeaned or afraid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I left the unit I was given more information, telling me what would happen within the next week or so when I would get my letter back from the department in Hobart. I did receive that letter, which gave me more information. That is the sort of thing that has to continue, not just at that screening level but at the next level, when a woman is diagnosed. I am fortunate. One in 10 to one in 16 women in Australia are not so fortunate. So we must continue this gentle&mdash;may I stress `gentle'&mdash;but informative flow of information to the women of Australia in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women misunderstand what being diagnosed with breast cancer can mean, so information is going to alleviate many concerns and then to inform on what is going to happen in the future. I come out of the education field. I cannot stress enough that that is definitely the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After further deliberations by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), as the honourable member for Pearce said, we now have a national breast cancer centre. I am particularly pleased that not only is the national breast cancer centre going to look at research in that area and to look at support, but it is also going to be looking at the dissemination of information. That is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area is funding. Certainly these things do mean a lot of funding. I was a little bit disappointed by the previous speaker's slightly negative notions on this, but may I say that we have started. The women of Australia, with support from our male colleagues, have begun the process. At least we are not where we were 10 years ago, when nothing was happening, basically. So the process has begun and it can accumulate from here. While there are committed women and men&mdash;and I do add `men' here&mdash;not only will this continue to be highlighted in our country but the report from this committee will never become covered with dust and dirt on some shelf. There are too many dedicated people in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin) and the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), along with others on that committee. We will not let the report gather dust. There are many extremely important recommendations in it that we will follow up. I say that with absolute conviction because I know the dedication of the people I have spent the last 18-odd months with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity afforded by this parliament to be on this committee and to work with my colleagues. I thank the parliament also for its dedication in looking at this. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the opportunity to speak briefly on this report, on the management and treatment of breast cancer, when it was tabled in the House on Monday this week. I would like to reiterate my appreciation of the work done by members of the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs and also for the support given by and the work of the committee staff. I commend the chair, the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin), for the role she has taken. I really should say that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) was no token male. Despite the fact that when this committee was being made up we thought we should have a male, he did not behave as a token male. I feel that he, like other members of the committee, has found it a most valuable experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a bipartisan approach taken, as has occurred in other inquiries. There was certainly a degree of commitment and we worked well together. That is the way that something as important as breast cancer should be dealt with. I found myself in the unusual position of being the only opposition member on this inquiry, but I was determined that the inquiry and the report would be wide ranging and have some real impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other acknowledgments which are due. My colleague the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) moved a private member's motion in the House of Representatives in 1993. That motion was related to increased funding for breast cancer research and I was asked to second it. I thought I already knew something about breast cancer but, when I undertook my research for the motion, my education in this area really began. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was seeking this information, I contacted Professor Grantley Gill, whom I knew at that time only by reputation. I also spoke with Dr Jill Robinson, because we worked in the same building, although for two separate organisations. Jill works for the South Australian Breast X-Ray Service. She put me in contact with Dr Wayne Tilley, a medical researcher at Flinders Medical Centre. I found myself with excellent material to work with and I was inspired by the commitment that these people displayed to their work. Jill Robinson and Grantley Gill were later to give evidence to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also in this material that was provided to me that I found the quote from Professor John Forbes as to how women could find out more about servicing their car than they could about the optimal treatment for breast cancer. I must confess that I got a scolding from an older and more conservative surgeon in Adelaide for having used that quote. Knowing what we know now, I am glad I used that quote. It is now history that John Forbes also gave evidence to the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate for me to acknowledge the commitment and interest that John Hewson showed in highlighting the need for further research into breast cancer. I am sure he will be interested in this report, and I will make sure he receives one. It was when I first visited Flinders Medical Centre with John and his wife Carolyn that I first met Dr Stephen Birrell, who was also later to give evidence to the inquiry. When I found some technical difficulty, or found that a woman was ringing me to find out about her breast cancer and I needed expert advice, he was always at the end of the phone. I am grateful for that. On the same occasion I also met Wayne Tilley and that provided me with the opportunity to put a face to the telephone voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to record my special thanks to all those people who put in submissions and who found the time to give evidence. As I mentioned on Monday, it was a privilege to take part in the inquiry. I also acknowledge the time that Dr Cherrell Hirst, who is the Medical Director of the Wesley Breast Clinic in Brisbane, made available to me when I visited her clinic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I detected an early reluctance on the part of members of the medical profession to take part in another inquiry, as the Senate had conducted its own inquiry into the early detection of breast cancer, and here was another lot of politicians wanting more of their time. That attitude changed very quickly and an excellent dialogue existed between the committee members and the profession. It was wonderful to hear from the women. I am sure it took some courage for them to come forward. There was an often expressed view that they did it in the hope that they would be able to help other women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I became a member of parliament, I worked in a large organisation where there were over 500 staff. More than a hundred of them reported directly to me and the majority were women. This provided me with the experience of living the statistics. The statistically predicted number developed breast cancer, including those well below the target age group. I saw what it did to them and how it affected their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Monday I touched on the need for information to be distributed to the community and also to the profession. I note that Anthony Green, when he was giving evidence to the committee, said that there was a definite lack of education, not only for the public but amongst doctors and some surgeons, as to the current state-of-the-art knowledge of breast cancer and the options for treatment. On Monday I also mentioned in the House the emphasis that was given in the inquiry to the need for further research to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that occasion we also spoke about the degree of cooperation. It is important to acknowledge that there is a movement forward. Changes are taking place. Even as the committee was receiving evidence, there was an endeavour on the part of some members of the profession who are leaders in their field to educate their colleagues. The report from the breast cancer consensus conference was tabled for our information by Professor Alan Coates. I reread that report last night, having not looked at it for some time, and I was interested to see documented there some of the things that we have been highlighting in our speeches and that we found during the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that these people are acknowledging the things that are important to improve the outcomes for women. In this report it says that one in 25 of all women will die of breast cancer and that one in 13 will have it by the time they are 74. There is evidence that the incidence of breast cancer is on the increase. That makes allowances for the fact that there is an ageing population and that the screening programs have led to earlier detection. Thus, breast cancer is being recorded statistically to a greater degree, although perhaps previously, before those cancers were detected, those women were recorded as dying for other reasons. There is evidence that breast cancer is on the increase, so I would like to think that the inquiry will be beneficial in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those members of the profession who do not think it is appropriate for members of parliament to be attempting to lead them in a particular direction, if they read the consensus report and absorb that they would be going some way to educating themselves. I do admit though, as experts in the field have acknowledged, that it is very difficult to keep up with all the reading. We all know that but I hope the inquiry report may have developed that further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report, a lot of emphasis is given to the emotional impact that breast cancer has on women. I was pleased that a page and a half of this brief report from the consensus conference was also devoted to that. We have made strong recommendations about counselling in our report. I hasten to add that that is not just to benefit patients, although that is important. Counselling would also benefit those who are caring for them. In our report we quoted Mr Tony Green, Secretary of the Divisional Group of Rural Surgery, Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not sure, in truth, that I could cope with seeing more than the number I see now&mdash;emotionally and in terms of time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I work mostly 12 hours a day, and some of the more difficult time consuming stuff is spending hours with my breast cancer ladies&mdash;firstly, in the decision making process and, secondly, in the support and care straight after the surgery when more questions arise. Then they perhaps go for  radiation oncology, and then they are back again with questions they did not ask . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People caring for women with breast cancer also have to contend with such things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out to me that in a report in one of the papers in the last couple of days it was said that our emphasis on the multidisciplinary teams could be construed as setting up power bases. During the inquiry, concern was expressed that centres of excellence should not just be in capital cities and not go out to the country. As members of the committee would know, and as those who read the report will find out, that was not our recommendation at all. The multidisciplinary approach is what is required. There is no need for members of that team to be physically under the same roof. In fact, interesting networks throughout the country and in rural Australia have already been established. We had evidence to that effect. I recommend that as a very flexible way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been asked many times in the last couple of days about what will happen to the report. As a member of a committee that worked in an apolitical way, it is disappointing to read reports that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has scorned the report. I have also read reports that representatives of the minister's office have said that the last budget fixed the deficiencies raised in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> claims that a spokesperson for the minister said that some of the report's claims were misleading and that the government stood by its record. This spokesperson says that our committee failed to take into account `new incentives to tackle the disease such as the breast cancer centre and additional research funding'. What a pity the minister is to play politics over such an important issue and what an insult to the members of the committee who have devoted so much time and commitment to this inquiry. Why not read the report and even study the evidence before making a knee-jerk reaction based on political expediency rather than fact?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry we heard evidence that Australia had received funding for breast cancer research due to our Third World status&mdash;given that the internationally accepted minimum in medical research is two per cent of health expenditure and Australian investment is 1.4 per cent. The minister should have been aware of criticisms made during the inquiry about a national breast cancer centre because I questioned her about it in the House on 6 June 1994. Given the political nature of her immediate response to the report, I shall quote it again for the record. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Is she aware that there has been significant criticism of the proposed $16.4 million national breast cancer centre announced in the budget? Will the minister admit that all she is doing is setting up a clearing house for research? Will she do as Professor John Forbes suggested when he gave evidence to the public inquiry into the management and treatment of breast cancer: either await the findings of that committee or, at the very least, change the terms of reference so that research becomes a function of the centre?</PARA>
<PARA>The often reported claim that the budget allocated additional funds for medical research does not stand up to scrutiny. To prove my point, a report to the Australian Medical Association, produced by Access Economics, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore the effective change in spending on health and medical research in the four years is a reduction of almost $50 million per annum. On the face of it, the government does not presently have a strong commitment to health and medical research.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the government will belatedly give this report serious consideration. I also hope that the report will be widely discussed by the medical profession. Equally importantly, I hope it will promote community education and the production of accurate information for women to have about breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media has an important part to play in community education. I hope it can resist the temptation to sensationalise. In this area, I wish to congratulate the local paper at Dubbo. In the days following the committee's visit there&mdash;Professor Alan Coates tabled the report from the consensus conference at that meeting&mdash;the local paper published a lot of factual and helpful information which could only have benefited the women in that area. I again commend the report to the parliament and hope that it receives adequate attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to speak to this report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, having been a member of the subcommittee which put it together. Those who have read the report will note that the dedication is to the women of Australia and it is to the women of Australia that I would like to dedicate my speech this morning. The other speakers, both in the House and here, have spoken about the substance of the report, the methods of treatment and the management, so I will focus my brief remarks on some of the women that we came into contact with during the inquiry and also the women of my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a woman&mdash;and I think I can probably speak for the other women on the subcommittee&mdash;I found it was a very personal experience working on this inquiry. Some of us have had a brush with this disease in one way or another. Some years ago, I had a benign lump removed from my right breast. At the time, the gynaecologist who was treating me did not know whether the lump was cancerous. He thought it was not and, as it turned out, it was not. But, nevertheless, having an operation to remove a lump, about the size of a golf ball, was fairly traumatic and also painful. I felt very much in line with the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry I often remarked to some of my colleagues, as we were listening to the most intimate of evidence, that I found my hand reaching towards my chest to see that everything was all right. It is something that I think only a woman could understand; it was a very moving experience. Of course, listening to that sort of medical evidence, apart from wanting to clutch my breast to see that it was okay, I was wondering: who is right? We heard such a variety of evidence. We heard from a doctor who thought that every case of breast cancer ought to result in a mastectomy and we heard from others who thought that other kinds of treatment were appropriate. I felt a mounting degree of confusion which has, to a great extent, been alleviated by the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women talked to us about their dealings with the medical profession in their particular cases. The quote which is at the introduction of chapter 2 is, I think, very apt and I would like to read it. This woman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps at 38 years old I was caught in a system that assumed patients are older and more willing to give in to the medical pressure. . . . Decisions were being made on my behalf and I was expected to agree and not be a problem. This kind of pressure is very difficult to withstand. . . . I don't think women are considered as equals in the decision making process. I don't know how this attitude can be turned around but I certainly felt I was treated like a child who should leave everything to the grownups.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a quote dealing with breast cancer, but it is a quote that could apply to a lot of women in dealing with the medical profession, particularly older women. I think that younger women are a bit more wise now. They see themselves as equals with the doctors and do not treat them like gods. But it reminded me of my sister's story about her mother-in-law who, while tending an ailing and ageing spouse, used to sit indoors all day if the doctor said, `I might pop in tomorrow.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of attitude has gone through the profession, particularly when dealing with such an intimate part of a woman. I guess that, because of their reproductive capacity, women do get prodded and `mauled' a lot more perhaps than men do, so we are very sensitive to that. Most gynaecologists until fairly recently were men. I had a theory once that a lot of men went into gynaecology because they hated women. Certainly some that I had dealings with were that way, but I am glad to say that I found that some are excellent and very compassionate. But that can be a real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Female conditioning is part of that in saying that the doctor knows best, we must do as we are told. We had quite a number of instances of medical insensitivity to women. One woman&mdash;the members of the committee will recognise her&mdash;gave some very strong evidence. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had a young doctor resident there . . . I was talking to him just casually one day . . . and I said something about the future. He said to me, `Oh, if I were in your situation, I wouldn't plan the future.' And I said, `Oh! What do you reckon?'. He said, `You might live two months' and he sat back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Then he looked at me and said, `Of course, you might live 20 years, but neither one of them is really very likely. But do not plan your future too far ahead, will you?'</PARA>
<PARA>This is a woman who had a very responsible position in the community. She lives a fair way from a major city. When she discovered that she had breast cancer, the specialist who gave her the news said something like, `Well, you've got breast cancer. Do you have private insurance?' When she said no, he held the door open and said, `I don't treat public patients.' The honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) has talked about the need for sensitivity, the need for counselling and the psychological effects. I must say that I felt, `My God, how would I feel if something like that happened?' Any woman hearing that would be absolutely devastated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This same woman had to travel a long way to a major city for chemotherapy, thought she had finished the course, came back and was told that, no, she had only had half of it. When she refused to go back because her arms were black and blue from all the treatment, the doctor called her husband in and talked only to her husband. He said, `If she doesn't continue with this treatment, it's down to you, it's your fault'. As she said, they did not speak for several weeks before she resumed some treatment. In the end she gave up and said, `Well, if I'm going to die, I'm going to die.' She is still a very prominent person in her community and surviving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the kind of women that we spoke to would fall into two categories&mdash;obviously, younger women and older women. In relation to the older women I found that, certainly in the inquiry but also in my electorate, I had a lot of women come to see me after I had made it known that I was on this committee. Also one of my local doctors arranged for a whole morning in his surgery when he brought in, one after another, women with breast cancer that he had treated. The stories of the older women were very tragic because most of them were, by that time, at a stage where the cancer had spread to other parts of the body&mdash;it is particularly tragic once it is in the bones. They were undergoing at that stage, I guess, palliative treatment and pain control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One woman gave me a little notebook that she kept. She had entered every contact, every experience and every treatment in it. It went back over some years. I felt very emotional about seeing that&mdash;the record of her life and her treatment. Her husband was beside her and very supportive. She talked positively about what was happening next. I thought she was going to die, and probably quite soon. But she stoically went on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also met some of the women in Dubbo whom the member for Adelaide referred to, particularly women on farms, who were, in many cases, running the farms themselves. They had to go to the city for treatment&mdash;for surgery and for radiotherapy or chemotherapy&mdash;yet they were still there, running their farms and saying, `I am not going to let this thing get me down.' I think that was very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The younger women, as shown by the quote I just gave, are a little bit more uppity and want better treatment. One woman in my electorate told me of her experience. She was in her early 30s and had just entered into a new relationship when it was discovered that she had breast cancer. Her GP referred her to the local surgeon&mdash;a very good surgeon&mdash;and he said, `Fine. We will have to take the breast off.' She actually worked at the hospital, although not in a medical situation, and she knew her way around enough to know that she should get a second opinion. So she went to one of the well-known doctors that we took evidence from at Westmead Hospital. He examined her and said, `No. There is no need to remove your breast. You can have a lumpectomy and have conservative treatment after that.' To his credit, the surgeon who first gave an opinion carried out that operation. He was not too stuck in his ways; he simply was not one of those specialised people. A lot has been said by other speakers about the need in this area for specialists who really know the disease intimately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem of my constituents and a lot of the people we heard from was the problem of having to travel for treatment. Those honourable members who know my electorate will know that it is a couple of hours drive from Sydney and there are some very isolated places in it. Women have to travel long distances to have chemotherapy and to have radiotherapy. I am glad to say that, after a lot of lobbying, the present government&mdash;I hope it is not just because it has an election coming up in a couple of weeks&mdash;has now announced that it will open an oncology outreach clinic at the Blue Mountains hospital in Katoomba, so women can have their chemotherapy there. There is an outreach radiotherapy clinic planned for the Nepean Hospital at Penrith, so those women in my electorate will not have to travel quite as far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard also about the psychosocial needs involved. Another interesting quote from someone who gave us evidence was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent evidence . . . suggests that women who were involved in their treatment decision and where medically possible, offered some choice tended to be better psychologically adjusted at a three year follow-up. It did not matter which surgery type they had chosen.</PARA>
<PARA>That goes back to what I started with&mdash;the treatment of the attitude of doctors towards women. Women who have doctors who sit down and explain to them what is happening, give them some choices and explain what the alternatives are&mdash;as we have seen from that quote and all the other evidence we took&mdash;are much better adjusted to their situation, as are their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this disease, as we have said, has sexual connotations and female image connotations. One of the things that I certainly would fear would be its effect on how I looked and so on. Somebody quoted a person from a support group who was sitting by the bed of a recovering patient and said, `Your husband will still love you.' I think the member for Adelaide loves that quote. I think that is at the heart of a lot of those situations. I have heard men talking about this disease on the radio, saying, `All I wanted was my wife to be well.' But I am sure there are men who feel that their wives are no longer complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some wonderful older women in my electorate who make jokes about their prostheses: `Oh God, I have lost some weight and now the other one is too big!'. One was talking about doing the garden and leaning over and having her prosthesis slip out. I think this is where support groups are very important. They mean that the women can get together and talk about those things with like-minded people, and share a joke like that, as well as expressing how they feel about themselves and about the disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the government on the setting up of the breast cancer centre. It was being set up during the inquiry so we did not have a chance to see what it was going to do. I think it will do an excellent job collating research, developing best practice systems and providing information. </PARA>
<PARA>As other speakers have said, information is extremely important. Women have often had to find information for themselves because it has not been provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to comment on the remarks by the member for Adelaide about the newspaper reports of the reaction of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to the report. In fact, the minister did not say those things. The comments were made by someone on her staff and, I understand, were misquoted. The minister is very supportive of what we have done and I am sure she will give the report her full attention when she responds to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly the member for Brand (Ms Fatin), who did an excellent job chairing the subcommittee, and the members of the secretariat, who did a brilliant job in pulling it all together and looking after us as we travelled around the country talking to so many people. It is a job well done and I look forward to seeing some very positive results from it. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the discussion today because breast cancer is of special interest to me. I would like to start with a quote from the Hancock Family Breast Cancer Foundation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breast cancer, more than any other disease, strikes at the very fabric of the individual . . . the woman's sexuality, motherhood and self-image, and affects the whole dynamics of her family. Like other malignancies, it robs the community and the work force of valuable members . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the report being presented today is dedicated to the women of Australia. That is a very good idea because it is a particularly significant report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pass my own personal congratulations on to the member for Brand (Ms Fatin) for her initiative and leadership of the subcommittee. I also acknowledge the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith), the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and the member for Franklin (Mr Quick). Although the member for Franklin, as the member for Adelaide said, might have seemed a token male, I am sure we will hear that was not the case when we hear him speaking in a moment. I am sure his compassion will be evident through the report and also in his own speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have read the report. I believe it is a substantial report and a landmark report as well. It is significant because there has not been a lot of information about breast cancer in the past. We are beginning to recognise that breast cancer kills six Australian women per day. The mortality rate of 40 per cent has not changed that much over the last 50 years and it is an important issue. I acknowledge my colleagues from Western Australia now sitting in the gallery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was on International Women's Day last year that the lobby for life campaign commenced. Some time last year we presented petitions from over 100,000 petitioners to parliament. Those petitions, according the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, are still arriving in parliament, so it is an issue that is of importance within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the report is a landmark report because it covers a number of issues, in particular, improving knowledge at medical schools and helping doctors to become more aware of the issue by updating their skills. It also recommends some best practice treatments being distributed, and I am sure that the cancer centre that we have spoken about so often will be developing those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise two points. The first concerns information. This point has been discussed with me by a colleague in Western Australia. This particular woman has had a mastectomy. She told me that at the time she was told she had breast cancer no information was given to her. As the member for Bass quite rightly said before, when told of tragic news it is hard to take in information immediately. There was no information given to her so that she could go back to her family and discuss the issue. I would like to read recommendation 29 on information. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The committee recommends that women be provided by practitioners with written information about breast cancer to which they and their families can refer repeatedly.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the emphasis is on `repeatedly' because it is a process and the information needs to be looked at repeatedly. The recommendation goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information should be written to meet the differing needs of individuals by encompassing approaches which range from the purely supportive to the medically sophisticated. Information should be presented in a manner which will not make assumptions about which level of information the recipient will require.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very significant recommendation and one that all the people involved professionally&mdash;whether they are practitioners or are involved through government&mdash;should look at and address immediately. It is a very important area and I would like to do justice to the woman who came to me and asked me to try to get this information in, as well as congratulating the committee for recognising its importance and putting it in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of importance for me in discussing this whole issue is increasing funding. I know that the government is increasing funding in research and I compliment it on that. But I do not believe it is enough; I do not believe it is anywhere near enough. I get criticised repeatedly by the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) for a statement when I spoke  about AIDS. I was not commenting on AIDS, but on the parity between diseases. I said that the funding disparity between research on breast cancer and other diseases was alarming, and that that was not a criticism of other funding projects but an urgent call for parity. That is what I am calling for, and in every discussion and speech I have made on breast cancer, I have asked for an increase in funding and research, because it is a serious issue that the community does not necessarily pay enough attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to say that the report is great. It should not be put on the bookshelves of history and be forgotten under cobwebs. I am sure that members of the committee, because of their compassion about the subject, will ensure that it gets the recognition it deserves. I can assure the committee, and also my colleagues on the subcommittee, that I, too, will not let the issue rest. It is one that I have taken on board as an issue for me to continually work with whilst I am in parliament. I give that assurance to my colleagues and fellow committee members, and I again congratulate the committee and its chair for their great work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like other members of the Committee, welcome the opportunity to speak on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the management and treatment of breast cancer</EMPHASIS>. It is interesting to note the widespread coverage in the media on the release of the report. One hopes that the principal players in this area&mdash;the women, the medical professionals, the support personnel, and state and federal governments&mdash;will have a very long and thorough look at our report, and that they will not only look at the committee's recommendations but read fully the whole report, not just once but several times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate on three areas in the report: data collection, research and counselling. As a lay person who sought to gain a real understanding of all aspects of the management and treatment of breast cancer, one would assume that the normal starting point would be reading all the available material associated with the topic. I must admit that I could not match the member for Brand (Ms Fatin) in her enthusiasm, but I did try to gain some understanding. I found that the medical side of this equation was readily available, but the real missing link was the paucity of regional, state and national data which would enable anyone, let alone a beginner, to try to comprehend a comparison of treatments and outcomes. In this day and age, with the emphasis on technology and the information age, there is no reason why data cannot be collected, collated and exchanged in any part of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One wonders at the wisdom residing in the decision makers and administrators both in the hospitals and the state and Commonwealth health departments who have not yet come to realise that, without a properly resourced national data collection system which can access and compare state and territory information, enabling the comparison of treatments and outcomes in the management and treatment of breast cancer in women throughout Australia, these women are getting a second-class deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was told on several occasions that the hospital registrars, the bean counters, saw the staff involved in this valuable aspect of the medical process as the first in line of dispensable people when cutbacks occurred in hospitals. As a former resident, I was pleased to note that South Australia was to the forefront in establishing a prototype hospital base register system. It is interesting to note the comments made by Professor Alan Langlands in this regard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential that long term funding is provided to make available outcome data on diagnostic and treatment strategies. To do so, cancer registries based on the individual hospitals and health areas must be funded and developed as a matter of priority. This requires financial support for Area, State and National co-ordination. Additional funding is also required to ensure that Hospitals have access to the appropriate biostatistical advice and computing facilities adequately supported.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Martin commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cancer registries properly maintained can exert a beneficial influence on medical staff concerned with patient care in hospital. Its maintenance can lead to a modification of treatment regimes, better record keeping and provide up to date results for study by hospital staff. Unless this is done one finds the staff, even medical staff, have a total ignorance of what is being accomplished within their own hospital. I have absolutely no doubt that if earmarked funding was provided for public hospital breast cancer registers, preferably using an agreed history, examination and treatment proforma, that advances in the treatment of these patients would become available more rapidly, particularly if the hospitals were able to pool their data.</PARA>
<PARA>I now move to the contentious issue of research. Research into breast cancer is currently pursued in two major forms: research at the cellular level, particularly molecular biology; and clinical trials where differing types of treatment are tested. In this regard it is interesting to note the comments made to the committee by Dr Stephen Birrell from the Flinders Medical Centre on the overall lack of financial support for medical research:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless you know the data, you cannot offer solutions; you cannot offer patients choice.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the second time that I have been involved in a House committee report on health issues. In the other case I was also amazed at the lack of coordination in the health system in this country. I guess, as a beginner, that this is a result of having vested control in the states and then expecting the federal government to fill in the pieces or pick up the tab when the system fails or when there is a need to have a national approach to a particular health issue. Another complicating issue is the size of and power exerted by the very large hospitals in the capital cities. Quite often their priorities are not those of the governments and by their ingenuity they have managed to find funding sources outside the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does appal me as an Australian to realise that Australia has achieved recognition as a Third World country when it comes to the amount of money allocated to medical research. What annoys me even more is that there does not appear to be any concerted, systematic and rational approach to the whole issue by all the sectors involved. I think it is time to stop the point scoring and address the issues immediately. We must work to stop the whole issue of health funding, and health research funding in particular, being addressed on an ad hoc basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the issue of counselling, an area that I am very interested in. Most people when faced with a visit to the doctor have a genuine feeling of inadequacy. When a woman is being treated for breast cancer there is a real and continuing need for her to be able to communicate freely and frequently with those treating her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence provided to the committee as it journeyed throughout Australia showed us in graphic terms that we have serious deficiencies in this area. The blame cannot and should not be shafted home to any one group. To show both sides of this problem, I would like to read two quotes. The first is from Ms Pat Coonan from the Cancer Support Group of Victoria. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many breast cancer patients complain to us about the cold and clinical way their medical practitioner or specialist informs them of a cancer diagnosis. There often appears to be little account taken of how the diagnosis affects the patient emotionally or how the prospect of surgery may damage the patient's relationship with her partner if she has one. Sometimes marriages break down after breast surgery. Many medical practitioners do not refer their patients to organisations such as ours for support.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other side of the spectrum, Mr Anthony Green, a member of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, made a statement, and this has already been referred to by another honourable member today. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not sure, in truth, that I could cope with seeing more than the number I see now&mdash;emotionally and in terms of time . . . I work mostly 12 hours a day, and some of the more difficult time consuming stuff is spending hours with my breast cancer ladies&mdash;firstly, in the decision making process and, secondly, in the support and care straight after surgery when more questions arise. Then they perhaps go for radiation oncology, and then they are back again with questions they did not ask.</PARA>
<PARA>It is disappointing and very unfortunate for the women in Australia, and their families, that the need for the integrated participation of the specially trained nurse or some other professionally trained counsellor in the management and treatment of breast cancer has not received the recognition and support it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a world class model operating in the United Kingdom and its value is slowly being recognised here in Australia. Professor Grantley Gill of the Royal Adelaide Hospital gave evidence to the committee. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think one of the things we could do, and which we are going to do at the Royal Adelaide Hospital because we got funding for it, is something which I saw working very well last year when I visited a few breast units in the United Kingdom. Over there all the breast units have one or more breast care nurses who have psychological training as well as working with the clinic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think you need backup from the time the patient is seen by a doctor in a clinic, for however many appointments there are, to when they come into the hospital. That is where these breast care nurse-counsellors provide that backup, often with an outreach situation; they meet the patient in the clinic; they become involved with the family; and they monitor any problems or changes in decision . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As other speakers have mentioned, there are many other issues tied up in this wonderful report and they are just as frustrating to address. There are many wonderful examples of best practice cancer management and treatment throughout Australia. The women of Australia deserve the very best irrespective of where they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that all those involved in the management and treatment of breast cancer take note of our recommendations and I look forward to the government's considered response to this report. Once again, I thank all my fellow honourable members of the committee for their sterling work in this report under the able `chairability' of the honourable member for Brand and her wonderful guiding hand throughout. I sincerely thank people for the opportunity to serve on the committee. I commend the report to the Main Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs report on the management and treatment of breast cancer is the second major report on breast cancer produced by the current parliament. The first, which dealt with breast cancer screening and the treatment in Australia, was conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs last year and was responded to by the government in December. While there is some amount of overlap between the two reports, they provide an overview of breast cancer and raise many important questions about the way we are dealing with the disease, from screening right through to education and research. Today I wish to touch on some of these issues, particularly as they relate to women in my regionally based electorate of Hinkler. Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer in women. However, it is really a disease that ultimately touches every person, male or female, and every dimension of the family; and even the extended family is affected. The statistics are even more frightening, with breast cancer affecting one in 12 Australian women. Over 6,000 women a year are diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia. About 2,500 women per year, or seven per day, die of the disease in Australia. On present trends&mdash;and this is a frightening statistic&mdash;over the next 10 years, if current patterns were to stay in place, 30,000 women would die of breast cancer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the growing focus and awareness of breast cancer since the last election, these two parliamentary inquiries are both timely and very valuable, as they have generated a lot of interest, information and community discussion. What I have found most pleasing in these two reports is the recognition, at last, of the disadvantage and sacrifice faced by women living in rural and regional areas such as my own, based on the provincial cities of Bundaberg and Gladstone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 census figures showed that 47 per cent of women aged 35 years and over reside in non-capital city areas. I suspect the figure is even higher in Queensland. There is clearly a huge responsibility for government and the medical fraternity to address the need of these women living outside the capital cities, particularly as breast cancer is a disease that affects older women. Yet, as these two parliamentary reports testify, this has been the area where the infrastructure and support for screening, treatment and management of breast cancer have been abysmally lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no clearer evidence of this than in my own electorate of Hinkler, yet fortunately I can report that in relation to public screening facilities the situation is at least on the improve. Women over 40 years of age and living in Bundaberg, in the Wide Bay-Burnett subregion, generally have not found it easy to take advantage of the Commonwealth's much publicised national program for early detection of breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These at risk women have to travel up to 300 kilometres or more in one direction or other to access free public screening, either to Nambour on the Sunshine Coast or to Rockhampton in Central Queensland. For many of these women it is a one- or two-day trip that is difficult to afford in time and money, as many of them have the responsibilities of children and/or workplace activities. Too often, women have to put off getting a screening mammogram because of the inconvenience and the cost. Thankfully, from time to time, various community organisations have organised the so-called `boob buses', a term I do not use in any disparaging way. They are a measure of the substandard service that has to be offered to women, notwithstanding the fact that the people who organise those services do a marvellous job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the government's further five-year commitment to the national screening program as contained in last year's budget, Wide Bay-Burnett women will at last be able to have access to a free screening centre closer to home. Last July, after several years of waiting and lengthy community consultation, a new three-pronged public screening service was announced for the southern part of my region. This will include a fixed screening and assessment unit based in Bundaberg, a satellite service based in Hervey Bay, and a relocatable unit to travel to the more remote hospitals within the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new $800,000 screening and assessment unit in Bundaberg is due for completion in the middle of this year and will include a medical director, Dr Therese Ryan&mdash;who has already been appointed&mdash;a radiographer and nursing and administrative staff. The unit will also have access to other specialist staff, both public and private, including pathologists and radiologists. It will provide a caring and multidisciplinary approach, as discussed by my colleague the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), in terms of breast cancer screening in the Wide Bay area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some debate in the Bundaberg community that the new public facility will simply duplicate the service that is already provided by the private sector. This is a fact that comes out in one of the recommendations of the Senate committee's report, recommendation 16, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Program avoid any duplication in the provision of screening services, but that it utilise both the private and public sectors in the provision of screening services subject to all the services meeting the guidelines for accreditation established by the National Program.</PARA>
<PARA>Some duplication will occur in Bundaberg, but that will only be to a certain extent. Wide Bay and Burnett women can currently get a screening mammogram from a private clinic; however, it is not free. Only diagnostic mammograms attract the Medicare rebate, and that is only if there are actual symptoms of breast cancer or if there is a history of disease in the family. One civic-minded local clinic has been charging patients the Medicare rebate level of 85 per cent of the scheduled fee so, in that instance, there has been no additional cost. However, the fees have to be paid up front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the new Bundaberg public clinic will provide a complete, specialist and unique information centre for breast cancer screening. Where private operators have won the day and have provided the free public screening program, such as in Cairns in Far North Queensland, the private operator has set up a specialist facility like the public facility planned for Bundaberg. I am certainly a firm believer in making greater use of the private sector, and I expect there will be some significant contribution from the private sector in the provision of the national screening program in the Wide Bay and Burnett area. Firstly, it is likely that the Bundaberg core centre will use privately based radiologists to read film; and, secondly, the satellite service at Hervey Bay, while not yet finalised, could possibly be contracted out to a private operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, given the long wait that the Wide Bay and Burnett women have had, and still have, for such a free screening service, I have publicly supported the interim measure of the government paying a fee or a rebate to private clinics that perform screening mammograms for eligible women in the age group at risk, or for those who require diagnostic help. Given the sheer number of women to be screened in the Wide Bay and Burnett area, making use of private facilities in the interim would seem a commonsense approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving then to the northern part of my electorate, which is in Central Queensland, women from Gladstone, Mackay and Longreach, and from the central west in general, have had to travel to Rockhampton to take advantage of a free public screening program. A number of community organisations and individuals have assisted some of these women in overcoming the disadvantage of distance, in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Gladstone, I would particularly like to commend the efforts of the former President of the Port Curtis Lioness Club, Maria van Gorkom, who, after her mother's brush with breast cancer, made a personal commitment to try to assist as many local women as possible to access the Rockhampton screening service. Over the last two years, she has organised some twenty-eight 18-seater buses to transport local women to Rockhampton. In total, she and the Port Curtis Lioness Club have transported over 400 Gladstone women to Rockhampton. This is truly a remarkable achievement, and I understand that the Lioness Club buses are still operating under the new president, Shirley Lee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Still, for many of these women, and other women in centres such as Biloela and elsewhere in the northern part of my electorate, it takes at least a whole day&mdash;if not two days&mdash;to obtain a free mammogram in Rockhampton. For women of Longreach and the central west&mdash;part of the electorates of my colleagues the members for Kennedy (Mr Katter), Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and Capricornia (Ms Henzell)&mdash;the time taken is more like three days: a day to drive in; a day for the screening; and a day to get home. Again, many women have been unable to afford this sort of time and cost, and have put their own health at risk for the sake of the family business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, this situation is about to change, with the commissioning of a new mobile breast screening van to be ready in mid-April. This van, complete with two roving radiographers, should be ready to handle about 40 women a day. It will enable women who had previously been unable to readily access Rockhampton to have access to a regular public screening service: something that their city sisters have enjoyed for some time. The vehicle will be a valuable educational tool as well, disseminating breast cancer information to many parts of the Central Queensland area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like many women and families of Central Queensland, am eagerly awaiting the mobile service's first scheduled visits. Although the mobile unit in Central Queensland is eagerly awaited, I believe the service could be further enhanced within my electorate with the provision of a satellite service in Gladstone, perhaps not unlike the one I mentioned earlier in respect of Hervey Bay. Whilst I recognise that there is not the same specialist fraternity available in Gladstone as there is in Rockhampton and Bundaberg&mdash;and my colleague also mentioned the necessity of that networking arrangement&mdash;I believe that it is important that Gladstone be recognised in women's health matters as a growing community with diverse medical needs. It is a rapidly expanding industrial city and it needs this kind  of service in order to be ahead of the pace, rather than behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, whilst I in no way depreciate the quality of a mobile unit or the necessity for it, I intend to lobby for a permanent free-standing satellite unit to be established at the Gladstone Base Hospital. This would facilitate access to women from Gladstone City, Boyne Island, Tannum Sands and Calliope, as well as the rural people from Agnes Water, Miriam Vale and the Boyne Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Gladstone satellite screening service could mirror what is being done in Hervey Bay. Films would have to be read and data based in Rockhampton, but I believe that would be a better system than periodic van visits, particularly in the light of the demand already demonstrated in Gladstone, with over 500 women having travelled to Rockhampton on organised buses in the last two years. Such an extension of the Central Queensland service fits in neatly with what both parliamentary committees have recommended in terms of access for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst my electorate and much of Central Queensland still awaits the public screening service, the broader issues of management and treatment for those women in rural and remote areas who are diagnosed with breast cancer need to be addressed. Again, both the committees recognised this in their reports, in particular, recommendation 31 of the report of the House of Representatives committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Brisbane hearings of this committee I, like many other people, was horrified to hear a prominent Brisbane breast cancer surgeon say that some women living on drought affected properties had sacrificed themselves for their families, by choosing a quick mastectomy instead of six weeks radiation therapy in Brisbane. It is horrific that women should have to sacrifice their health because of the drought&mdash;the quick mastectomy and then on with the work. It shows the spirit of those women, but it is a dreadful price to pay. Another prominent Brisbane breast surgeon said in evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem [of isolation from facilities] must be attended to urgently. The lack of radiation treatment centres outside major cities was a serious concern . . . and giving women travel assistance and accommodation is not a suitable response in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA>Such radiation treatment centres cost millions of dollars. In Queensland the only centres are in Brisbane and Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA>If governments cannot provide additional treatment services, they have a responsibility to provide adequate travel assistance to patients seeking treatment in other centres, whether it be for surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or some other forms of treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, there should be provision in such travel assistance for an escort, especially for patients receiving treatment for the first time. Psychological support is important for the sake of the patient herself and for a positive outcome. Cancer support workers in my region tell me that the travel assistance issue is amongst the biggest concerns of cancer patients and, as the House of Representatives committee has suggested in its report, it is an issue that needs urgent attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Brand (Ms Fatin) and the members of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs for an excellent report. I will follow the previous speaker in confining my comments to the provision of these services to rural and remote regions. I draw the attention of the Main Committee to that section of the report dealing with rural and remote patients. Forty-seven per cent of women aged 35 years and over reside in non-capital city areas, and that proportion is larger in Queensland. The report states the obvious: most of these women are disadvantaged in their access to breast cancer multidisciplinary teams and allied treatments. The report goes on to discuss lower referral rates and looks at the reasons why this occurs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reason, and I think it is probably the main reason, is the current lack of mammography screening programs in country areas, which has led to most lesions presenting at the palpable stage with a consequent need for more radical surgery to be undertaken. That is the real problem that we have to address in rural and remote areas. It is obvious that the second and third are also difficulties. They are in relation to assessing radiotherapy facilities and the practices of some country based surgeons being a problem. But it is true, as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) said, that we have got a lot to do to provide these services to all women in Australia, wherever they reside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that in my electorate it is very welcome that there is a breast screening unit now at Calvary Hospital in Cairns, which is accessible to women in Cairns. But I also represent the remote areas of the Torres Strait and Cape York Peninsula, and that does provide real technical difficulties in relation to providing mammography screening programs. I have been dealing with this as long as I have been the member for Leichhardt. The difficulty is that we have not got the technology right to get the screening to remote areas. The main problem is the roads: the roads are just too rough to get the screening units out there. It is very sensitive equipment which cannot be shipped around the country without damage, which would therefore damage its effectiveness, so it is a real problem. That is something that we have to address in terms of research and development. We need to provide some sort of scheme to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that one way of getting these units in is by barge, and I think Queensland Health is looking at that at the moment. That is particularly relevant at this time of year, the wet season, when that is sometimes the only way you can get into remote communities. Communities in my electorate like Weipa, Kowanyama, Aurukun and Lockhart River are accessible by barge, and that may be one way of getting the equipment in. It has been suggested on some occasions that there is also a problem with the reliability of electricity supplies for these units, so that may be another problem, but I have been assured by the FNQEB that in Far North Queensland that is not a problem. Nevertheless, we have got this problem about the roads, and that has to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in my electorate there is also a problem in areas that are not so remote. I have had correspondence from the Douglas Shire Health Action Group, and I commend that group for its concern about this issue. I also commend the Queensland government generally for setting up and funding health action groups. I think they play a very good role. They are set up mainly to lobby the state government, but obviously they lobby members of the federal government about health issues in their areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Douglas Shire Health Action Group has a valid complaint that the mobile unit that has been set up in Far North Queensland does not go to Mossman and Port Douglas. For the benefit of people who do not know, I should say that Port Douglas is about an hour's drive from Cairns, and Mossman is a little bit further on. Although it is a windy road, it is not a dirt road. I have got here a letter from the then Queensland Minister for Health, Ken Hayward, explaining simply that the Queensland health department set up a breast screening clinic which operates out of Townsville and functions on a two-year cycle. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed that, at present, the clinic is fully utilised in the northern region and tablelands, the Innisfail area, and the peninsula and Torres Strait regions.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the clinic does not go to the Douglas Shire area in my electorate. It is a similar problem which the honourable member for Hinkler experiences in his electorate, in that women in Mossman and Port Douglas have to travel to Cairns. We are talking about the more senior members of the community, and there is little or no public transport between Mossman, Port Douglas and Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health action group has been looking at the situation, and there is a booking at a Cairns unit for women from the Douglas Shire, which will go some way towards solving the problem. Nevertheless, it is a real problem. We have women who, though they do not live in the remote areas of Australia, live in areas which are remote from regional centres, and they cannot access these facilities easily. Because of the very serious nature of breast cancer, we cannot afford to say that it is easy for women to drive for an hour or to stay overnight. Breast cancer is too important an issue to give those sorts of solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the government when I say that we have come a long way. I notice that the honourable member for Hinkler is nodding; this issue is a bipartisan issue. Although we are addressing the problem, nevertheless, we have to do more. The report on the management and treatment of breast cancer in Australia by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs recommends that the Commonwealth government, in conjunction with state and territory governments, standardise and broaden the travel assistance scheme. The report says that, in the event this cannot be achieved, the Commonwealth should assume full responsibility. I commend this recommendation. I know that the report is referring to the treatment of breast cancer, but obviously that point also applies in relation to screening for breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly recommend to the government that further resources be provided to carry out research into how we can provide breast screening units in the most remote areas of Australia. The reality is that the service is being denied to the women who live on Cape York Peninsula not because of the lack of resources, but because of the lack of technology. Women from that area have to come to Cairns to have the proper treatment or screening, and that means at least a two-day trip. In the case of breast screening, we have to develop a way to get screening units into remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report made reference to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women. The reality is that the women in remote communities, although they may come to Cairns from time to time, generally will not take the initiative to travel to Cairns for breast screening. If women in remote communities are to have access to breast screening, and remembering the level of poverty in those communities, a breast screening unit must be taken to them. If we do not have the technology at present, it is the responsibility of all political parties, at both state and federal level, to ensure that the resources are there so that the service can be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, in its response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on breast cancer screening and treatment in Australia, the government said that the National Advisory Committee for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer will be asked at its next meeting to consider establishing a subcommittee to look at the issues of implementation of breast screening units in rural and remote areas and to assess and to develop strategies. I am advised that there will be further strategies developed after those deliberations. The government response also states that access by women from rural and remote areas to screening services will be closely monitored by the program. The response says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter of financial assistance is a state responsibility. It is noted, however, that such assistance needs to be equitably distributed across all needs and all sectors of the population.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the government response to the Senate report on breast screening states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Advisory Committee will be asked at its next meeting to consider establishing a subcommittee to look at implementation issues in rural and remote areas and to assess and develop strategies.</PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that that is happening, and that further strategies will be developed after those deliberations. That government response states also:</PARA>

<PARA>That echoes the comment which the honourable member for Hinkler made and I am making, that if we are serious we have got to provide both services for the treatment of breast cancer and services for the screening for breast cancer in rural and remote areas. I certainly commend the committee for its report. I commend all members for their deliberations on this. It is a very serious issue and one which, obviously, women in our constituencies are very concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the women in the parliament. The women in the parliament, of both sides, have raised this issue and surely we need no other evidence that there should be more women in the parliament. Now that we have got more women in the parliament we are starting to talk about these sorts of issues which affect women. It is a tribute also to this parliament that we are adopting a bipartisan attitude towards the whole issue. I commend the report. I certainly hope that the government implements all the recommendations, especially the recommendations that I have made reference to in my speech. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have canvassed the main report pretty broadly today, I will just make a few personal comments. They are not about my personal health, because fortunately I have never had to experience breast cancer. But I suppose because of my age&mdash;I am now in my early 50s&mdash;I could not have escaped the fact that friends and colleagues of mine at various stages in recent years have had breast cancer. As a consequence of that, their experience touches people around them, as we found during our inquiry. Families and friends are very much involved in the business of breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During a visit to the United Kingdom in 1991 I decided to go to Scotland to meet a man, Professor Pat Forrest, whom I had read about in the Australian media. Pat Forrest was an eminent surgeon but is now retired. He was a person given the task of setting up the actual breast screening clinic in Scotland, and subsequently throughout the rest of the UK. I understand that he has a wife who comes from Melbourne and as a consequence he knew quite a bit about Australia. When visiting here he had made some rather critical comment about the management and treatment of women with breast cancer. I was interested in that, because it was not the sort of criticism that one would just look at and say, `Either he does not understand the situation or he is wanting to have a go at somebody.' It was constructive comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I went to talk with him about the treatment of breast cancer because, just before that overseas visit, a friend of mine, who had actually worked on my staff, was diagnosed as having breast cancer. I watched with a great deal of distress her efforts to get treatment and to be managed by the various people in Western Australia who were available to her. I also began then to look at other people who were similarly in what I called a maze of not knowing where to go and how to get appropriate treatment. So I talked to Pat Forrest and he to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came back to Australia it was a topic that never really left the back of my mind as one that maybe this parliament could get involved in. I was not sure how to begin the process because it is true that we had begun the debate about setting up a national mammography program in about 1988-89 and, after the government decided to introduce the program with the cooperation of the states and territories, that began to take place. Whilst there are certain comments that one can make about that, our inquiry had nothing to do with diagnosis; we were not looking at the diagnosis of breast cancer but rather what happened to a woman once she was diagnosed. When I became a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs it seemed appropriate to set up a subcommittee and look at the management and treatment of breast cancer in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank once again the members of that committee for their contribution. I think twice today people have mentioned the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) as our token male but I can assure him that none of us at any stage seriously thought of him as such at all. His contribution was greatly appreciated&mdash;and I think he knows that&mdash;not only by us but also by the witnesses who came before the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was also a very useful thing that the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) and I both have a medical background and that we were able to understand the terminology that we were beginning to read about, delve into and use. I also thank my colleagues the member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) and the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) for their contribution and participation in the inquiry. There really was a commitment and a dedication that overtook us because it is very hard not to get pretty passionate about these sort of subjects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to comment on the medical profession. At the beginning, for about six months, I read medical journals and other medical information about current practice in terms of treatment and management&mdash;when I could get my hands on any such literature&mdash;and I became conscious of the fact that the medical profession might look at our inquiry as being inappropriate and that it was important to gain its cooperation. We needed members of the profession to talk to us, to tell us what was optimal care and what was occurring when they were treating women with breast cancer. It was equally important to speak to the women and ask them what was happening to them and to hear their stories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague from Adelaide has mentioned some members of the profession whom she spoke to at various times to check and confirm things or to further understand certain matters. I think the first such person contacted us, and that was Mr Colin Furnival, an eminent surgeon, who rang the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and expressed a concern that there had been an inquiry in the Senate that we were duplicating. I reassured him that we were not and that ours was quite different. From that time, he and I were able to talk at any time when there were things to confirm or check. I found him very approachable and I appreciated that very much indeed. He also came before our inquiry. As members of the committee would know, he is the chair of the breast surgery section of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in Australia so his appearance before us was very valuable.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three other members of the profession, Professors Allan Langlands, Martin Tattersall and John Forbes, were also very approachable. I was able to speak to them informally and privately at various times to confirm that what we understood was correct or to glean more information about what the profession was able to do in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish my remarks by saying that, in fact, in this country, women are able to achieve and find some of the best treatment and management in the world. There is no question of that. But the difficulty is that not enough women are able to access that form of multidisciplinary care. Our report tries to show how that can happen, and we are asking for cooperation not only from the Commonwealth government but also from the state and territory governments&mdash;because, of course, it is they who have the delivery responsibilities of health, and governments can do quite a deal towards providing services&mdash;and also from the profession itself and the capacity of the profession to actually deliver multidisciplinary care to women with breast cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, when one reads the report, one will see that most of the recommendations do go to the profession itself. The way in which I have explained that&mdash;when I was asked, `How did you conclude what it is that you have recommended? How did you come to those recommendations?'&mdash;was to say that we held a mirror up to members of the profession and let them hear what they were saying. We let them talk about the lack of data. When we could not find it, we asked them if it was there and they said no, and they were telling us how they might be able to get it. When we talked about optimal care, they told us how it could be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talked about access for women in rural and remote Australia&mdash;and the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) and the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) have talked about the difficulties that some of their constituents have&mdash;and about how we would provide care, treatment and management of those women. When we asked, `Can the care be taken to them, or should they be taken to the treatment and management?' the profession was able to show us how it could be done. When we talked about counselling and the psychosocial problems that women have, the profession was also able to show us how optimal care could be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks today by again thanking all those people who were involved in this inquiry: the people who sent in their submissions and who came before us; the profession; all the governments; and the members of the committee. As has already been said today, this committee is going to continue its work, so we look forward to hearing from people who wish to write to us further, and we certainly look forward to speaking with the profession further about how it might be able to implement a number of the recommendations in the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. It simply reflects the fact that, in this situation, and as indicated in my reply to Question 1808 of 5 December 1994, the investigation of such claims or allegations is a matter for the appropriate Papua New Guinea (PNG) authorities. Should those authorities approach the Australian Government, the Government would cooperate with any duly authorised investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Most of Australia's aid is provided in the form of Australian goods and services for specific, rigorously designed projects and programs. In this way, the aid we provide can be managed and monitored from port of dispatch to project site. We aim for stringent accountability in all our arrangements with contractors, consultants, international organisations and other governments. Further, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), undertakes its own regular and intensive monitoring and evaluation of aid projects and programs through its network of aid posts in developing countries and Canberra-based personnel. These procedures, combined with effective monitoring and review mechanisms, make it extremely difficult for aid funds to be redirected to alternative uses by recipient countries and ensure that the aid program is well directed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PNG is the only country to which we provide significant assistance in monetary form as untied budget support. However, both the Australian and PNG Governments have agreed that budget support will be phased out by the end of the decade. It is planned that there will be, commencing in FY 1994/95, a seven year straight line reduction of budget support to zero in FY 2000/01, and a corresponding increase in sector program aid. This will be consistent with the approach we take with other countries receiving Australian aid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. In FY 1994/5 $213.4 million will be provided in the form of budget support, $77.3 million will be provided in the form of jointly programmed aid and $16 million will be provided in the form of retirement benefits and termination payments to officers of pre Independence administrations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budget support payments are paid directly to the PNG Government and are disbursed as part of the annual budget appropriations made by the PNG Parliament. As such, these funds are disbursed through the normal processes of the PNG Government as reflected in the annual national budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Program aid is provided to support a wide range of development activities in six priority sectors (infrastructure, health, education, law and order, renewable resources and the private sector). The sector programs include provision of technical assistance, accountable grants for infrastructure, grants to community groups, scholarships, equipment and supplies to support sector programs and projects. Funds disbursed through program activities are expended in line with Commonwealth financial regulations for expenditure of public monies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the above, minor aid flows to PNG are also provided through a range of other program mechanisms. These include Development Training courses, Regional and Multi Country Programs, Emergency and Humanitarian Relief, support for Non-Government Organisation, Direct Aid Program projects through the Head of Mission Discretionary Aid Fund and Australian Development Cooperation Scholarships. In FY 1993/4 monetary assistance through these channels totalled approximately $22.75 million. As with program aid, accountability for expenditure is in accord with Commonwealth procedures.</PARA>
