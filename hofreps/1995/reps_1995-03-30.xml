<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) raised as a matter of privilege comments reportedly made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in respect of the Speaker, and me as Deputy Speaker. The honourable member quoted from provisions of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, and he presented copies of media reports referring to the remarks allegedly made by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 6 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 abolished the previous offence of contempt by defamation by providing that words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence against the House by reason only that the words or acts are defamatory. It is still possible, however, for conduct, including the use of words, to constitute a contempt if it amounts or is intended or is likely to amount to an improper interference with the free exercise by a house or a committee of its authorities or functions or with the free performance by a member of the member's duty as a member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member's complaint puts me in a difficult position in that I am one of the members who have been subject to the alleged attempted intimidation. Despite this difficulty, as Acting Speaker I am required to give a decision as to whether in my opinion a prima facie case has been made out. Having considered the arguments of the honourable member for Flinders, I have to advise the House that I do not believe anything improper has occurred or that there is evidence of an attempt to intimidate either the Speaker or me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House is indeed a robust place, and it is no doubt unlikely that any occupant of the chair will be immune from criticism outside the chamber in respect of his or her performance in the House. I believe, however, that it would only be in exceptional circumstances that criticism of the occupant of the chair would give rise to a substantive issue of privilege or contempt. I do not believe that on this occasion there is prima facie evidence of a breach of privilege or contempt, so I am not willing to allow precedence to a motion on the matter. I call the honourable member for Flinders, by indulgence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I appreciate that so early in the day today we have had the benefit of your views on the matter that I raised yesterday. Given your remarks yesterday, I suppose that I was not surprised at the outcome. It is not a ruling that you have made, and that curtails our opportunities to take the matter further today. I am disappointed in the manner in which you have approached this particular issue. You say that you considered the arguments. With great respect, Mr Acting Speaker, you conspicuously did not consider the arguments because you did not give me an opportunity to put the arguments yesterday. You specifically said that all I could do was to table the documents supporting the submission. You specifically upheld a point of order from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) which prevented my putting to you the case that I believed provided a firm foundation for the argument that I thought ought to have been considered by you in a more favourable light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The opposition raised the matter yesterday not just in light of the particular remarks that were made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to you and, in his absence, to the Speaker but also in light of the conduct of question time and the government's approach to the proceedings of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it has long been a complaint from oppositions that they do not get a fair go in the parliament. I suppose it is also true that the public has a fairly cynical view of our complaints about conduct of the proceedings. But the fact is&mdash;and you ought to know this, Mr Acting Speaker, given your family background&mdash;that standards in this parliament have deteriorated significantly.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a classic remark from the boy&mdash;the Assistant Treasurer&mdash;over there that it is all the fault of the opposition. The fact is that the standards in this place are set by the Prime Minister. People talk about rule changes. No rule changes are required to lift standards in this parliament. That is the fact of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not accuse us of party political point scoring. It is a matter of great regret for every member of this House that the standards of this House have fallen in the way in which they have. It is true that a lot of parents would hesitate to bring their children into the galleries of this place and hear Mr Gutter, our Prime Minister, perform as he does. That is the context, Mr Acting Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just remind members of some incidents last year. Following the 1993 election, we had a change in the speakership. I suppose we were hopeful and optimistic that a change in the speakership would see a lifting of standards in the parliament. I note that back on 4 May 1993 a newspaper article states that the new Speaker:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . proposed several changes to improve parliamentary procedures:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was time the Government responded to a report by a procedures committee that had suggested limits be set on the length of ministerial answers.</PARA>
<PARA>An interesting reflection, given that ministerial answers have considerably lengthened in the last couple of years. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, in an editorial on the same day, 4 May 1993, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last Parliament was largely a farce because of the mismanagement of the then Speaker, Leo McLeay. Mr Keating's bonds with Mr McLeay meant that no amount of inept or partisan chairmanship by Mr McLeay could count against him. Mr McLeay will be replaced today by Stephen Martin. Mr Martin has an opportunity to restore the dignity of the chamber. If he is to take it up, it will be primarily by restraining the Government rather than by keeping the Opposition down. The great possibility coming from the Martin appointment is that he is the first Speaker in 17 years to have higher political ambitions. Whether he can achieve them depends on his performance; the more the chairman and the less the cheer leader, the more likely he is to prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only his own career is in the balance. The Government has little to gain from abuse of the Chamber . . .</PARA>
<PARA>By the time we get to October 1993, this is what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> has to say under the headline `Sidelining the Speaker':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Parliament is an institution which is run on precedent.</PARA>
<PARA>I might add as an aside: I refer to these third party comments because I know that they carry greater weight with a lot of people because they are independent comments. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of this, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Stephen Martin, should resign from his position&mdash;in accordance with the Cope precedent&mdash;following the ruthless and humiliating action by the Prime Minister to use the Labor Party's majority in the House of Representatives to vote down new television broadcast rules which had been announced by Mr Martin only 18 hours earlier. The effect of the Prime Minister's action is to destroy the credibility of the Speaker's position. The implication is that the Speaker&mdash;who represents all MPs&mdash;must tailor his reforms to fit what is deemed to be the interest of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That was said in October 1993. My concern, and the reason we raised the matter yesterday, is that the reports of the Prime Minister's behaviour coming out of this week's caucus meeting fit exactly within the criteria and the concerns expressed by that editorial. In other words, the impression clearly is obtained that the Prime Minister exerts his influence and authority over you as a member of the caucus to ensure that he gets the results he wants in the parliament. That, of course, brings the parliament into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say much about the substance of the Prime Minister's concerns. It was quite incredible. It was a case of the wolf blaming the sheep for him to be attacking the Speaker. That says a lot about the arrogance of the Prime Minister. It just shows you how he has not learnt anything out of the Canberra by-election result on Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, leaving that aside, our concern is with the proper functioning of the parliament and the maintaining of some order in and respect for the high office of Speaker. Not for our own party political interests but for the sake of a well-functioning democracy, it is important that the office of Speaker be accorded the respect which it is due. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to your attendance at the caucus meeting earlier this week. The fact of the matter is that, when Sir Billy Snedden was the Speaker, he did not attend Liberal Party parliamentary meetings or caucus meetings. The reason he did not was that he was keen to ensure, as much as possible within our party political system, that he was seen to operate as an independent Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing I would agree with the Prime Minister on&mdash;the sad truth of the matter&mdash;is that no Speaker since Sir Billy Snedden has matched the standards which he set for independence as the Speaker. That was the Prime Minister's remark. I would not suggest, however, that you take any notice of his injunction to you that people ought to be thrown out of the parliament more regularly. In fact, it was because he had a lot of authority and was held in respect by most members of the parliament that the then Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, did not have to throw people out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning show that Billy Snedden, who was Speaker for seven years, threw out nine people, an average of nearly one a year. Harry Jenkins was Speaker for around three years and he averaged three a year. Joan Child was Speaker for 18 months and she averaged nearly one a month. Leo McLeay was Speaker for three and a bit years and he averaged one every three months. The current Speaker has averaged seven ejections in less than two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad reflection on the parliament and on the way the Labor Party treats the parliament that the standards have degenerated. A sort of philosophical underpinning of that is that the Labor Party has long taken the view that, if you get the numbers, basically it is a winner takes all proposition, that you can use your numbers and the end justifies the means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have never accepted one of the great principles upon which our democracy is founded; that is, the principle of the balance of power and a system of checks and balances. It is our view on this side of the parliament that the institution of the parliament and the way the parliament is run are a check and a balance against the abuse of executive power. Even though we may not have the numbers, we do have the conventions, the practices and the great traditions of this parliament to operate as a check against the abuses of people like the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad day when we read in the papers how you have been bounced around the caucus by a Prime Minister so that he can dictate to you the way in which you operate as the Speaker. This goes right down to the swearing in of Brendan Smyth. I was told this morning about it and I presume it is the case&mdash;someone one can deny it if it is not. Brendan Smyth on Saturday won a great by-election. The precedent is that, if the writs are declared when the House is sitting, you get sworn in at 3 o'clock in the full glare of the publicity so that the Prime Minister can get up and congratulate you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, no, unlike Martyn Evans, for example, who came in at a by-election and who got sworn in at 3 o'clock with all the hoopla that went with it, the Liberal candidate is going to be sworn in at an earlier hour, at 12.30&mdash;very neatly divorcing his presence from that of the Prime Minister and the embarrassment that that would entail. I am told that is the precedent and that is what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only assume that from on high the Prime Minister has given somebody marching orders as to how he would like the parliament organised today to suit his political convenience. I do not draw on this as an example, but I would have to say that someone was very quick on his feet this week. I wondered at the time what was up&mdash;</PARA>

He is now digressing from that issue to talk about other matters.

We are very concerned that this parliament's reputation in the Australian community has fallen to a new low. The incidents of the Prime Minister only give rise to concern in the public that rather than your high office being conducted in accordance with the great traditions of this place it is back subject to influence.

<PARA>Clearly, from the terms of that motion, it is a very serious matter indeed. I think we all realise that parliament is a robust place and we expect to give and take a fair bit. I think, by any measure, the actions of Senator Baume last week in the Senate went beyond the reasonable bounds of behaviour; indulging in what, by any other person, would be a criminal action and, in fact, which may be criminal action by Senator Baume himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday, in the adjournment debate, Senator Baume got up at 7.40 p.m.&mdash;right at the end of the parliamentary sitting day&mdash;and, in his terms, `dropped a bucket' on the Independent member for Manly in the New South Wales state parliament, Dr Peter Macdonald, just two days before the state election in which Dr Macdonald was a candidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the bucket was that there was a letter from the Australian Taxation Office to Dr Macdonald regarding his tax affairs which followed a tax audit. It was a private letter from the tax office to Dr Macdonald, advising him of substantial adjustments to his tax assessment for the years 1984 to 1988 which considerably increased his taxable income for all of those years, thereby requiring him to pay substantial additional tax. The letter from the tax office also contained his tax file number, divulgement of which is a criminal offence. Altogether, this was a particularly nasty, disgraceful and appalling piece of conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Senator Baume do it? According to his remarks in the Senate, he did it because he expected that Dr Macdonald's supporters were about to `drop a bucket' on the Liberal candidate for the seat of Manly in the election that followed two days later. He was simply retaliating in advance, as it were. In expectation that this was going to happen, he was making sure that he got in and had a bucket dropped on Dr Macdonald. Of course, no such bucket was dropped on the Liberal candidate. So the action that he was seeking to counteract in his explanation is an action which never occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He acknowledged on ABC radio the next day that he understood the local paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manly Daily</EMPHASIS>, would be the source of this bucket job and that when he made his attack on Dr Macdonald in the Senate he was not aware that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manly Daily</EMPHASIS> was not going to proceed with its intention. So we have him assuming an intention on the part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manly Daily</EMPHASIS> to do some heinous act in relation to the Liberal candidate and then saying that he was not aware that the paper was not going to proceed with this intention that he somehow assumed was going to be there. It all sounds very implausible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether there was ever any such intention by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manly Daily</EMPHASIS> or whether it was just a trumped up cover for a cowardly attack on Dr Macdonald's integrity, the fact remains it was a heinous action for Senator Baume to undertake. Even if he had good reason for his expected belief about what may be about to occur&mdash;and he gave no evidence for that whatever&mdash;to put it at its very simplest: two wrongs do not make a right. In any case, the wrong he was seeking to counteract never occurred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first of these is dated 24 March, is addressed to me and is headed `Use of TFN information by Senator Baume'. I will not refer to every part of it but I will refer to all the key parts. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation law creates certain criminal offences for the collection, use and disclosure of TFNs. These offences are capable of applying to any person. There are also provisions which prevent the use and disclosure of taxation information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 8WB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence for a person to divulge or communicate another person's tax file number unless there is authority to do so under a taxation or other Commonwealth law. The penalties for a breach of this provision are a fine of $10,000 or 2 years imprisonment or both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TFN guidelines issued under the Privacy Act 1988 provide a similar obligation not to communicate or divulge TFNs. A breach of the TFN Guidelines is a breach of the Privacy Act which can be investigated by the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 8XB of the Taxation Administration Act creates an offence for any person to communicate information about another person's taxation affairs in certain circumstances. Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 creates a similar secrecy obligation to prevent taxation officers from communicating information about the taxation affairs of taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tabling of the information, which I understand included a TFN, by Senator Baume is prima facie an offence under section 8WB and possibly of section 8XB. However, I understand that parliamentary privilege would be relevant here and would prevent prosecution against the Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it is possible that offences may have been committed under sections 8XB or 8WB by the person or persons who divulged the information to the Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have commenced an internal ATO investigation to examine whether there has been a breach by ATO officers of the secrecy provisions in the taxation legislation referred to above. There is nothing at this stage to suggest an offence has been committed by a taxation officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am considering whether the matter will be referred to the Privacy Commissioner, Australian Federal Police or the Director of Public Prosecutions for further investigations.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously this was a matter that the Acting Commissioner, whom this minute is from, of the Australian Taxation Office took extremely seriously indeed, pointing out that major offences of the tax act would be involved if this action was taken outside parliamentary privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four days later, on 28 March, I received another minute from the Australian Taxation Office, this time addressed to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), but copied to me, which is quite normal practice. It is headed `Use of tax file number information by Senator Baume'. Again, I will refer to the key points. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, Section 8WB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence for a person to maintain, divulge or communicate another person's TFN unless there is authority to do so under a taxation or other Commonwealth law. The penalties for a breach of this provision are a fine of $10,000 or 2 years imprisonment or both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the tabling of the information by Senator Baume, the ATO immediately instituted an internal investigation into the matter. As a result of that investigation, I am satisfied that there is nothing to indicate that an officer of the ATO or any other Commonwealth Government Agency has breached section 8WB or any other secrecy provisions in relation to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has, however, clearly been a breach of section 8WB and that breach has a number of dimensions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a)the divulging of the information, which included a TFN to Senator Baume;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b)the maintenance (i.e., holding) of that information by the Senator; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c)the disclosure of that information by the Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, I understand that a number of journalists may have obtained the TFN before the Tabling Office disguised it in the document tabled. They may also be in breach of section 8WB by holding that information, whether they divulge it to any other person or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances, I have decided to refer these matters to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for further examination. Under established procedures a draft letter will be forwarded to the Treasurer for referral to the AFP through the Minister for Justice.</PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly a matter which in this second minute becomes even more serious. There is more emphasis on the fact that, simply by holding the information&mdash;obtained from whatever source&mdash;about that person's tax file number, an offence has possibly been committed. That is a very important additional development and one which Senator Baume would do well to take considerable note of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Baume's action is obviously exceedingly serious. It undoubtedly amounts to disgraceful behaviour and, indeed, criminal behaviour, for which Senator Baume relies on parliamentary privilege for protection. His action amounts to criminal behaviour for which any other person could be up for two years in gaol, a $10,000 fine or both. In fact, the issue really is whether parliamentary privilege extends to cover Senator Baume for holding and maintaining this number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume's attitude to this has been to not apologise for the release of Dr Macdonald's tax information. He gave the excuse that it was only an intended retaliation for something that may have occurred but, in fact, never did. Senator Baume has expressed ignorance that the documents contained a tax file number. He said the documents referred to a file number and had `our reference' rather than `tax file number' or `TFN' on them. He said that, when he realised the documents contained a tax file number, he acted to have it removed from the documents&mdash;that is, after the documents had been tabled in the Senate and at least three journalists had obtained copies of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, Senator Baume should not have tabled the documents with the tax file number on them. In his desperation to drop a bucket on Dr Macdonald, Senator Baume was not concerned about the impact on Dr Macdonald's privacy. He should have realised that a file number from the tax office could well be a tax file number, and he should have removed it from the documents before tabling them. But he did not do so. It should also be noted in this connection that, just by receiving and holding the documents with the tax file number on them, Senator Baume would appear to have breached the Taxation Administration Act. Holding information is an offence and revealing it is another offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to consider who supplied this information. Senator Baume has not said how he obtained these documents, but whoever gave them to him was clearly acting illegally by holding Dr Macdonald's tax file number and revealing it to Senator Baume. Whoever gave that information to Senator Baume has committed a criminal offence. There is absolutely no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, the New South Wales Liberal Party knew of Dr Macdonald's tax assessment revisions a couple of years ago but, according to statements by Premier Fahey in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 25 March and by Dr Macdonald on ABC radio, Dr Macdonald was given a clear undertaking that this tax issue would not be raised publicly. Of course, it all happened at the very last minute in this election campaign through Senator Baume's disgraceful actions. Under whose auspices was Senator Baume acting? Why did he do it? He obviously did it for political advantage. Was he acting entirely on his own behalf or was he acting with information of other people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important for this House to know, through this debate, what information the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) had about this matter. Everybody knows that Senator Baume is a close friend of the Leader of the Opposition. It is very important for us to know what the Leader of the Opposition actually knew about what Senator Baume was doing. Did he agree that Senator Baume should be able to undertake this criminal action? Or was it something he had never heard of?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if he had not heard of it beforehand&mdash;that is doubtful&mdash;why has he not said anything since? It has been one week since this happened and, as far as I am aware, there has not been one statement from the Leader of the Opposition condemning Senator Baume's actions. That is the most extraordinary thing. You would think that honest John would be very concerned about the fact that one of his parliamentary colleagues had undertaken criminal action in the parliament and had cooperated with people who had undertaken criminal action by giving him that information. You would think that honest John would be very concerned about that and would make a statement distancing himself, and the opposition generally, from such action. But has there been any such statement? No, there has not. There has not been any dissociation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is the chance today, one week after the event, for the Leader of the Opposition to so dissociate himself from and to condemn Senator Baume. You would wonder why he would have to wait for this substantive motion to come before the parliament to do it but I invite him to come into this House and make that statement today so that we know, albeit somewhat late in the piece, that he is prepared to say that this is an action for which his parliamentary colleague should be condemned. He should join us in supporting this motion because he knows, as everyone opposite knows, that this action is so utterly reprehensible and indefensible that, in conscience, they should join us on this side in supporting this motion and should not seek to divide the House on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the most appalling and amazing developments in recent times. There were the actions of the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who is sitting up the back, in relation to the Aboriginal affairs document relating to the Hindmarsh Island bridge case. That was amazing: interference with other people's mail; photocopying eight kilos of documents clearly not his. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition keeps going around, saying that the member for Barker acted honourably. Acted honourably&mdash;photostatting eight kilos of somebody else's mail and then disseminating it all over the place! That was a disgraceful and clearly reprehensible action, and he is now rightly on the back bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have another case of somebody else's mail being interfered with. This opposition seems to be breaking into people's mail all the time. How did they get hold of this letter, which was Dr Macdonald's personal mail? Is it going around breaking into people's mail all the time and then divulging it publicly? Leaving aside the divulging of the tax file number, the breaking in was a disgraceful enough action in itself because it goes to the privacy of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the tax file number issue came before this parliament in 1988 there was an enormous debate about privacy. The opposition made a lot of noise about the need to ensure that tax file numbers would not interfere with individual privacy. It made a lot of noise about how it had demanded changes to the original proposal so that the privacy of the individual would be protected. Yet here is an opposition senator clearly quite prepared to disregard totally the issue of privacy, not only in relation to a taxpayer's tax commitment as decided by the tax office&mdash;which is disgraceful enough&mdash;but also in relation to the tax file number itself, which he revealed. Coming from an opposition that has expressed an extraordinary amount of concern about privacy, that was a disgraceful action indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Leader of the Opposition will take advantage of this debate to come in and condemn Senator Baume for his action. If he does not, we can only assume that he agrees that Senator Baume is acting in an okay way and that he is not at all concerned about the criminal action of his colleague. That would be an extraordinary development and one which would condemn the Leader of the Opposition as a person, who, for all time, will be a joke when the reference is made to `honest John'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume is a widely respected and liked senator, with a good reputation. Let us face the facts. You are into Senator Baume for one reason, and that is that he has been on to the Prime Minister and his pigs for years and he has been absolutely under the Prime Minister's skin. That is the fact of it; that is the motive of it. It is just a piggery cover-up. Your only other motive is that you are so worried about John Howard's successful return to the leadership that you thought you would have a shot at him as well, just for good measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was such a transparent, lacklustre effort by the Treasurer that it barely calls for a response. What a humiliating performance we saw from the Treasurer. This is just a payback for the fact that Senator Baume has been asking a very simple question: how come a bloke who has been on an MP's salary since he was 26 has been able to accumulate assets more relevant to and more likely to be accumulated by the get-rich-quick merchants of the 1980s? Explain how the Prime Minister can have millions of dollars worth of property in Sydney when he has spent most of his time in politics on a backbencher's salary. That is Senator Baume's crime.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three reasons why this motion ought to be thrown out. Firstly, it is an abuse of process&mdash;and I will quote <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> in a moment to substantiate that point. Secondly, on its merits, I believe this motion is unworthy. Thirdly, the motives behind this motion are so transparent that I encourage the two Independent members to give it very careful consideration. To make a very strong point, I refer the member for North Sydney and the member for Wills to page 347 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> where it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A motion of censure of a private Member has been moved on only one occasion. The motion was agreed to. A motion has been agreed to censuring the Leader of the National Party, then in opposition, for conduct unworthy of a Member. On a further occasion a motion was put to the House condemning the Leader of the National Party for reflecting on the Speaker, but the motion was withdrawn, by leave, after the Leader had apologised for and withdrawn his remarks. On a number of occasions a motion of censure of the Leader of the Opposition, or an amendment expressing censure in the form of an alternative proposition, has been agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the particularly relevant point, gentlemen, and I encourage you to note it. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are considered to be bad precedents. Such resolutions, as distinct from a resolution of the House suspending or expelling a Member, are of no substantive effect and are only regarded as an expression of opinion by the House. A motion in the form of a censure of a Member, such as the Leader of the Opposition, not being a member of the Executive Government, is not consistent with the parliamentary convention that the purpose of a vote of censure is to question or bring to account a Minister's responsibility to the House. Furthermore, given the relative strength of the parties in the House, and the strength of party loyalties, in ordinary circumstances it could be expected that a motion or amendment expressing censure . . . would be agreed to, perhaps regardless of the circumstances or the merits . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This whole process is to bring the executive to account. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, this motion, if passed, would be bad precedent. There is only one precedent, and that is because the House in the past has not been prepared to use this process in the way proposed by the government. Regardless of the balance of the matter, I put it particularly to the Independent members that, whatever you think of the merits, a new process should not be hereby developed. The rules and conventions on this matter are absolutely clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other precedent which is worth referring to is the one in respect of a senator being the subject of such a motion from the House. On a trip to Singapore, Senator Sim made some remarks which were apparently racist in their tone. On that occasion, the House repudiated the sentiments of what the senator had to say. That is the only precedent that might be relied upon for this motion. As I say, that should be differentiated on the basis that it related to the sentiments which might otherwise be attributed to his remarks. In respect of process, if this motion is passed, this would simply be an abuse of process&mdash;and that is very clear authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure, the answer to that question is that the precedents give you a guide to the practice and conventions of the parliament. I do not put it any stronger to you. If you want to change the nature of the process which has been used to bring the executive to account, you are obviously going to do so. But, whatever you say, it is a substantial point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter goes to the merits of the issue. The motion, firstly, condemns Senator Baume. In fact, when the senators considered this matter with a more independent flavour to the debate, they changed that. They deplored his actions; that is true. But they referred to his negligence in tabling a document, whereas this motion refers to the condemnation of Senator Baume for his commission of an act. In fact, the Treasurer went further and said that it amounted to a criminal offence but for the parliamentary privilege. That is a gross exaggeration. In this country you are innocent until proven guilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, as I want to show in a moment, that the release of the tax file number detail was entirely inadvertent and therefore the suggestion which is behind this whole motion&mdash;the allegation that this was a deliberate act, a deliberate revelation, in breach of a Commonwealth act, of a tax file number&mdash;is totally false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the resolution of the Senate and the motion in this House call on Senator Baume to apologise for his behaviour. He admits that the TFN was revealed and he has apologised for it. The precedent in this House in such circumstances where such a motion is before the House and the member then proceeds to apologise is that the motion is withdrawn. On that basis the motion ought to be withdrawn. It is quite clear. His letter of apology has been tabled and on that basis, in respect of the restricted matter of the TFN, this motion ought to be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing which on its merits ought to be noted is that what happened in the Senate&mdash;the Treasurer failed conspicuously to mention this&mdash;is that Senator Baume spoke in the chamber and then sought leave of the minister at the table, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), for the tabling of the document. She did not just peremptorily review the document; she studied it. Then she, on behalf of the government as the duty minister, gave the consent&mdash;the leave&mdash;for the tabling of the document.

It is as clear as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Senator Baume made a mistake&mdash;and he has apologised for it&mdash;and that that number should not have been disclosed. But he did not at the time realise that it was a tax file number. As soon as he was aware of it, he took immediate steps, without any prompting, to ensure that that document did not go any further. It really is as simple as that. This was an unfortunate but inadvertent disclosure of a number. It was not obvious on the face of the document that it was a tax file number. It was tabled with the consent of the government. The senator has done a reasonable thing in terms of attempting to curtail or limit its distribution. He has apologised to Dr Macdonald for this issue of the tax file number, and that basically ought to be the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it is not the end of it is: firstly, you people want to abuse the processes of parliament; and, secondly, you are not prepared to accept that the proper place for this is the Senate where there has already been a resolution.

The first 15 minutes of your contribution in this House you lectured us about propriety, about how we should uphold the standards of this place, and the second 15 minutes you were trying to defend what is the indefensible. You know in your heart that what Senator Baume did in the Senate last Thursday night was rotten, it was grubby, it was underhanded and, for all intents and purposes, it is probably criminal as well. The holding of a tax file number, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has pointed out, clearly, on our advice, breaches the tax laws. An investigation will be held into that and we will see where the senator stands.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Throughout this speech and throughout the previous speech the member for Gilmore has carried on a tirade of objections. They have been most unparliamentary. He has been using language that should never be allowed. He has been accusing people of being criminals, and it should not be allowed. I ask you to warn the member for Gilmore and tell him that he is not entitled to carry on the way he is at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Newell)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;This matter is obviously creating some emotion on both sides of the House. I would ask members on both sides to restrain themselves. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the tax file number is the most important and most confidential number you should have in your financial affairs. It underpins the integrity of the tax system. To divulge a tax file number, as the Treasurer has rightly pointed out, carries substantial penalties&mdash;a $10,000 fine and two years gaol. That is for the holding and disclosing of a tax file number. As I said, that will be investigated. Senator Baume, when the Australian Federal Police do come around, should answer their questions truthfully, and we will see how he comes out of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had experience with these things and I would like to relate that experience and the double standards held by the opposition when it comes to the disclosure of what it sees as privileged information. A number of years ago I sought some information from the then Minister for Health, Dr Blewett. I was inadvertently given what were said to be doctor provider numbers. There was a big hullabaloo about that. When I sought information from Dr Blewett, I never sought those numbers&mdash;I never got them&mdash;and I never disclosed any information from those documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when Dr Blewett came into the parliament and said he had given me information from the Department of Health, there was a censure motion moved. It was moved by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. I went back through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to see what standards he had then in his former role as the Leader of the Opposition. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot think of a greater abuse of privacy, a greater abuse of privilege or a greater abuse of confidentiality than that which this Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Dr Blewett&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has engaged in on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA>In actual fact Dr Blewett never knew anything about it, because I went to a member of his staff. The point is that, even though none of this information was ever released publicly and the only thing the then Leader of the Opposition knew was that I had received some coded information from the Department of Health for which I had asked one of his staff, that was enough for the Leader of the Opposition to move a censure motion against the minister and me. A subsequent investigation into that matter cleared everybody of any allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were the standards set back then by the Leader of the Opposition. I want to look at the standards set since John Howard has become Leader of the Opposition. What we are looking at now is a totally different set of standards from that enunciated by the then Leader of the Opposition when he talked about my involvement with that information back in those days. Since Mr Howard has been the Leader of the Opposition, we have seen push polling in the Canberra by-election&mdash;one of the grubbiest, dirtiest election tactics you would ever see. Since he has been the Leader of the Opposition, we have had stolen documents being used by the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) in this House. Worse than that, confidential information was distributed to all of the media in Adelaide and to defence attorneys who were challenging the Commonwealth. Now, while he is the Leader of the Opposition, we have this trafficking in tax file numbers in the Senate&mdash;all for grubby political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), said that all we were interested in was the tax file number. We are interested in more than that. We are interested in the whole ethos of the way in which this opposition is conducting itself. Those three instances that I outlined have all happened since John Howard became the Leader of the Opposition. At the next election, if John Howard is still the Leader of the Opposition, we will be in for the grubbiest, sleaziest election campaign in this country's history. You can see the way in which it is headed. Ever since he became Leader of the Opposition, we have had from the Liberal Party these underhand, dirty tricks all aimed at its opponents&mdash;but none of which, I venture to say, have been as sleazy as that which took place a week ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As the Treasurer rightly pointed out, what has Mr Howard said about this latest episode, about his friend releasing somebody's private tax details and tax file number? Not a word. The double standards are appalling. I turn back to Dr Blewett. Anybody who knew Dr Blewett would know what a principled man he was. What did Mr Howard say about Dr Blewett and the information given to me? In the conclusion of his censure motion against Dr Blewett, Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He should resign and go forever from the front bench of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Howard said about Neal Blewett in 1988 when he was taking the high ground. What has Mr Howard said to Senator Baume? Nothing. I do not know why they call him honest John. I really do not know. It is dishonest John, because he has said nothing to rebuke Senator Baume for what he did. Thank goodness there is a streak of decency and a bit of justice in the world, because I see in today's paper that Peter Macdonald has been re-elected to the seat of Manly. So all of that was for nothing. Senator Baume sought some political advantage out of it, but he did not get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to relay a story about the impact that this episode has had on the public. I received a call from a person in Manly who saw my name on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manly Daily</EMPHASIS> and the comments from my office in relation to this matter and the way in which the tax file number had been used. Last Sunday night, Senator Baume and the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) sat together on a flight from Sydney to Canberra. This gentleman was sitting behind them. With Senator Baume's having performed this act, having dropped this tax file number and all of the information, you would think they might feel a bit embarrassed. You might think that was a bit below the belt and that the best thing to do would be to shut up. Did they shut up? Not on your life. They were bragging about it on the flight from Sydney to Canberra. They were laughing and saying what a great job they had done to put it up Macdonald and the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bloke was sick to his stomach. He said that he felt like pouring a glass of beer over them. He reported the incident to my office. So people do get offended about these things. They do get offended when politicians traffic in personal information about people. They do get offended when the law is broken. They do get offended when politicians brag about it on aeroplanes. You would think that Senator Baume would have the decency, having performed this act, to just say, `I have done the act,' and maybe slink off somewhere to hide. But, no, not on your life; here he was bragging about it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You would never get an apology. I know the member for Throsby feels very strongly about this. Why would you ever get an apology about this? These guys are actually bragging about it. They think it is smart. They completely misunderstand the Australian people, because there is more than a streak of decency to Australians out there. They do not like these tactics. To the extent that the Leader of the Opposition by his silence condones these tactics, it paints him as a leader not worth having.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to look at another matter. The fact is that while Mr Howard was Leader of the Opposition&mdash;and the Treasurer mentioned this&mdash;we had a serious debate in the parliament about privacy matters. No-one was more strident in standing up for the rights of privacy of Australians than the then Leader of the Opposition. We all remember the Australia card debate and the high ground taken by members of the opposition. The then Leader of the Opposition was poncing around the place championing individual rights, claiming that the card was going to be used by the government to control the lives of individuals and that it was a tool of Big Brother. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the Leader of the Opposition not out there telling Senator Michael Baume that he should not be dropping tax file numbers? The simple fact is that what he says and what he does are two different things. The Leader of the Opposition will stand up for everything that is good, but when it actually comes to performing, when it actually comes to laying the cards on the table and rebuking one of his close friends, where is he?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer he ran the taxation system of this country into the ground. He is still undermining the tax system but from a different direction. He is now condoning the release of tax file numbers in the Senate. You can say that with certainty, because he is not saying anything against the people who do it. This in his view might be smart politics. It sure beats generating policies. It is a lot easier to get up and assassinate someone's character rather than do the right thing and tell the people of Australia how you would run the country. But the simple fact is that it is no substitute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Treasurer has rightly pointed out, the holding of a tax file number is clearly a breach of the law. This matter has been referred to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and the truth will out in the end. But Senator Michael Baume should not think for one minute that he is out of the woods on this one, because activities that he undertook outside of parliament will be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just draw those themes together. Since John Howard has become the leader of the Liberal Party, the campaigning techniques of the Liberal Party have hit the sewer. There has been the push polling, this grubby tactic here last week, and the use and the distribution of stolen material in this House&mdash;all while he has been the Leader of the Opposition. I reiterate that, if he is still Leader of the Opposition at the next election, we will have the dirtiest, sleaziest campaign this country has ever seen. The writing is on the wall. The direction in which he wants to take the Liberal Party is clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition is dishonest and he is two-faced about the standards on privacy matters. During debate on matters he will always take the high ground. He will always stand up for the individual and say that nothing is more sacred than a person's privacy&mdash;until it comes time to do something about it. What he should do&mdash;and he knows he should do&mdash;is to rebuke Senator Michael Baume publicly for what he did. Any decent leader would do that. If anything like that happened on our side, the Prime Minister would have us in the office so fast that our noses would bleed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot trust the current Leader of the Opposition near a tax office. He could not run a decent tax system when he was Treasurer and now he is undermining it by condoning, by his silence, the unauthorised and illegal use of tax file numbers. This clearly shows the standards of the Leader of the Opposition. He is clearly unfit to be the Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>

<PARA>The funny thing was, though, that in that same year 10,000 ordinary Australians got prosecuted for the same offence. Double standards? I think we are starting to see them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next double standard I might bring to your attention is the case of Mr Charles Wright. Mr Charles Wright, a well-known fund-raiser for the Labor Party, was described in the Western Australia Inc. campaign in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other payments of particular concern were made to Mr Charles Wright, who operated a fundraising and business relations consultancy. He had done work for the ALP since 1976 in assisting with fundraising at the Federal level . . . Subsequently, Mr Wright made payments to Mrs Brush for which he was recompensed from the No. 1 account. In essence, Mr Wright was a conduit for $80 000 that was paid from the No. 1 Account to Mrs Brush. Mr Burke gave a similar explanation.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason I raise Mr Wright is that he failed to remit PAYE tax payments to the tax office for three consecutive years. I previously asked the tax office what its record was in being able to detect these things and it told me it was excellent. The funny thing, though, was that it was the same Mr Wright, the Labor Party fund-raiser&mdash;the one whose tax records show who the bagmen were for the Labor Party and who delivered from which companies&mdash;who got preferential treatment when, to put the facts down as they became apparent, the tax office put in a tax claim for this man's concern of $176,960.55 in unpaid PAYE. Funny thing&mdash;more preferential treatment by the tax office for Labor Party people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A funny thing happened here. When the Fitzgerald inquiry was on, the tax office was asked for all the National Party people's returns. Quick as a whip, the Australian Taxation Office sent off those files to the Fitzgerald inquiry. Then we come to Western Australia Inc. It is Labor Party officials and politicians this time. Guess what! The tax office says, `Sorry, we can't send the files, because it has to be protected.' Double standards!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the leaks themselves, and the most damning of them all relates to Mr Phillip Smiles who was the Deputy Treasurer of the New South Wales government. Amazingly there were details leaked about his affairs to the newspapers. There was no outrage about privacy; it was simply that the details were leaked about his personal tax affairs. There was no outrage at the time&mdash;except that it was, could we say, for grubby political purposes. There was the parliament on a knife edge. Had Mr Smiles been convicted of a criminal offence and forced out of the parliament at that time it would have meant there would have been a change of government; that there would have been a Labor government instead. So there was a very good political reason for leaking the details on Mr Smiles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked the tax office in estimates committee and Public Accounts Committee hearings about those leaks, what answer did I get? Dr Butterfield, who was in charge of doing the security checks, asked that a report be done, and he came back and said, `We were innocent; we didn't leak it.' I asked, `Where is the report? Could we see the report?' He said, `Oh no, section 16 of the tax act prevents me letting you have a look at the report.' I asked, `What happened to the report, Dr Butterfield? Did you actually read it?' `No,' he said. `Who makes the decision, Dr Butterfield, about whether or not a matter is referred to the DPP?' `Oh, I do, or the commissioner does,' he said. `I see. Did the commissioner read the report?' I asked Dr Butterfield. `Oh no,' said Dr Butterfield. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we had a report; we didn't read it; we had the details leaked; we had the prosecutions commenced and&mdash;guess what?&mdash;not under the Taxation Administration Act, oh no, but under the Crimes Act because only then could you have been certain of having the government change hands. So what did we see then? We had a prosecution; we had a barrage of publicity. Nobody said, `What about Mr Smiles's privacy?' Nobody was concerned about the fact that his privacy had been breached. We said that this was a matter of importance for the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How come we have one standard for Mr Smiles and another standard for Dr Macdonald? Let me remind honourable members that the amount of money involved in Mr Smiles's case was $11,000 or $12,000 and the amount of money in Dr Macdonald's case is $104,000. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) will be interested in this because Dr Macdonald has a very important medical practice, yet in the year 1988 he said he had an income of only $7,000. You can blame your tax agent, you can blame your accountant, but he actually had to sign off his figures himself. If he actually believed he had a taxable income of $7,000, then he should have been on welfare. In fact, the tax office made him pay another $40,000. </PARA>

They said that we were having a debate not about the fact that it was hypocrisy and two standards but on moral integrity. Well, we are. The fact of the matter is that we see patently every day that there are two standards exercised in this chamber. There was a request for a serious matter to be referred to the Privileges Committee by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith) in this place. But, oh no. Were any of us surprised when we got the answer we got? Certainly not. We expected it, because that is the way business is conducted here&mdash;on double standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back and point out that in several cases in the New South Wales parliament since the election in 1992 we saw again and again the question of taxation being relevant to the electorate of New South Wales. How come it was relevant when it was Terry Metherell or Phillip Smiles? Let me ask this: in the business of so-called grubby political capital or grubby political advantage, who was it that ran television advertisements, during the election we have just completed, featuring Mr Smiles as somebody who had been disgraced? Mr Smiles was in fact acquitted on the criminal charge, the charge that was meant to trigger an advantage to the Labor Party when it was first raised. Then he was hounded by the likes of your confreres until he had to leave the parliament. Let me ask you why, then, it is not reasonable for Dr Macdonald's tax matters to be on the public record, when it was for those of Mr Smiles and Dr Metherell? It is the same issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come to the question of the leaking of the so-called tax number. I want to read from the document that was duly tabled in the House. The letter is from dear old Mr Cortese, who is so good at giving letters of comfort to Labor Party people or their friends. At the top of the letter it does not say `tax file number' or `file number'; it says `our reference number'&mdash;`our' meaning the tax office. Pardon me, but I thought the importance of the tax file number was that it was allocated to us as individuals. I would expect such a letter to say `your tax file number', not `ours' meaning the tax office's number because that is not what it is. But that is what the letter says&mdash;`our number', meaning the tax office's number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we can go back a little further in the history of the tax office to something that occurred in 1992 when the tax office itself leaked documents about individual taxpayers&mdash;inadvertently, it said, because it pressed the wrong computer button. It sent details of individual taxpayers, including their tax file numbers, to the wrong people. What action was taken? Was anybody prosecuted in the Parramatta branch of the tax office? Oh no; certainly not. What happened? Well, we sent in a little team to do an investigation and we asked the Privacy Commissioner to have a look. Finally, what did we do? We wrote a little letter of apology to the people concerned. Here we go again&mdash;more double standards. We have got plenty of them, have we not? We have got Paul Keating who was not prosecuted for failure to put in his return but who got a letter of comfort, whereas 10,000 ordinary Australians got prosecuted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolutely true. Check the estimates hearings. We also have the double standards concerning Mr Smiles, Dr Metherell and Dr Macdonald. Somehow, it was supposed to be unfair for the electorate to be aware that Dr Macdonald had underestimated his tax affairs for six years, involving $104,000, and that is supposed to be kept private because it is not relevant in his case. But it was supposed to be relevant in the case of Mr Smiles involving $11,000 to $12,000 which was also repaid&mdash;a matter where he had to be prosecuted under the Crimes Act. Upon questioning, the tax office said that there had never been a prosecution under that section previously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the matter of the other members of the Greiner government who were investigated by the tax office, just coincidentally, and again we finally got a backdown from the commissioner, saying, `Yes, it was correct.' So we have double standards, don't we?  We have double standards when there is an error and, dare I say, unacceptable conduct from people on that side of the House. The weight of numbers is used in order to avoid the consequences of that act. Last week we saw the electorate make a decision about what it thinks about Mr Keating and his cohorts. Last week we saw the most unmitigated swing, a huge swing, against the Prime Minister, who said, `It's everybody else's fault but mine.' We saw a swing of up to 20 per cent in a safe Labor seat. The electorate made a judgment on what it thinks about Mr Keating. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should have been the end of the matter but in late 1992 the tax office advised Dr Macdonald that former Premier Nick Greiner's office had Macdonald's tax details and his tax file number. Greiner's office had contacted the tax office claiming Macdonald's tax details had been sent there by mistake. Shortly after this, the self-styled head-kicker for the New South Wales Liberal Party, Michael Yabsley, sneered at Macdonald privately in the New South Wales parliament saying, `Why don't you pay your tax?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1993 the then member for North Shore, Phillip Smiles, who was later convicted of tax offences, rang Macdonald to let him know that he also knew about Macdonald's tax affairs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Macdonald obtained documentation from the Australian Taxation Office clearly setting out the position, fully exonerating him, and sent copies to Greiner and New South Wales Premier Fahey, assuming he was dealing with honourable men. On 2 December 1994 Fahey telephoned Macdonald and indicated that he had examined the documents and quite properly agreed there was no basis for any allegations or question of wrongdoing. He undertook to advise the Liberal candidate and his advisers to that effect. Again that should have been the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But a few weeks before the New South Wales election a reputable major poll had Macdonald comfortably ahead by about eight per cent in Manly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) took over the Liberal campaign in Manly about this time and, concurrently, an unprecedented campaign of vilification commenced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then push polling commenced. Then came a further letter of character assassination to the electors. That was signed by Nick Greiner, a man who cannot accept that he was the architect of his own failure and who is consumed by a vicious desire for vengeance.

All this was on top of the usual massive campaign to be expected in a marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, at the last possible moment, the Liberal Party used this parliament, through Senator Baume, to smear Dr Macdonald in the full knowledge that he was totally innocent and in the face of a specific undertaking by the then Premier of New South Wales that Dr Macdonald's tax matters would not be raised in the election campaign. It is to the eternal credit of Peter Macdonald and the electors of Manly that this sickening parade of infamy was rejected, but I am afraid that Dr Macdonald would be less than human if what has happened does not colour his relations to the detriment of the Liberal Party, given the likely state of the New South Wales parliament over the next four years. </PARA>

As has been stated, it is a criminal offence punishable by up to two years in prison to use a tax file number and connect it to an individual or to divulge or communicate an individual tax file number to a third person. It also certainly means expulsion from state or federal parliament for any member convicted of or complicit in these breaches of the Taxation Administration Act 1953. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will enable Dr Macdonald to identify the informant and all the others through whom this tax file number has been passed.

The Liberal Party's actions in Manly have not only brought every member of this parliament into contempt but added to the public loss of trust in the institutions of the country. Do not make any mistake. The people of New South Wales did not put the Liberal government out because of their love for Labor or its policies. The Fahey government went because, in the public view, it was the greater of two evils. It went because of the sleaze factor. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistently he has moved motions in the Senate concerning me and my staff, the member for Gilmore and his staff, and the member for Macarthur and his staff.

It was driven by Liberal Party internal polling. Over lunch on Monday in this very parliament, Senator Baume boasted that, before his attack on Dr Macdonald, Dr Macdonald had a five per cent lead. That lead disappeared after the attack. It was a deliberate attack by the New South Wales Liberal Party using Buckets Baume to take the seat of Manly from the sitting Independent. This is the same Michael Baume who tried under parliamentary privilege to find muck in the investment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the piggery and who made outrageous comments about the Prime Minister's purchase of a house.

So the Liberal Party, which comes in here and runs a collective defence, was in possession of all details of the circumstances. Yet the day before the state election they chose, through Senator Baume&mdash;and it is the Liberal Party that is under attack here&mdash;to table that document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strong case that the Liberal Party has a tactic of going deep into the sewers of Australia and, indeed, it is going deeper and deeper into those sewers. To gain the evidence for this, look at a number of incidents that have occurred recently both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Look at the behaviour of the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) in this House when he used leaked material from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission to attack former Senator Richardson on the so-called Operation Wallah. Despite the fact he could not prove his case, he nevertheless had no hesitation in standing up in this House and doing a bucket job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what occurred in the Senate. A Queensland member of parliament, Mr Grice, again relying on confidential, leaked material from the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, let that information be used in an attack against Senator Ray, despite the fact that it was demonstrable that the information used by Mr Grice was false. Yet today we now have Senator Chapman with a notice of motion in the Senate which, if passed by the Senate, would require the National Crime Authority to give to the Senate all material or documentation it may or may not possess on this Operation Wallah. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party is saying, `These are good tactics.' But it is moving a motion that would create a criminal offence. If the Senate agreed to Senator Chapman's motion that the National Crime Authority produce documents concerning Operation Wallah to the Senate, the National Crime Authority would be in total breach of section 51 of the National Crime Authority Act which says that a person to whom this section applies, either directly or indirectly, who makes a record of any information or divulges or communicates to any person any information is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction or by a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a year or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the definition of who should not get it. A person to whom this section applies shall not be required to produce any document in any court. What does the word `court' mean? A court is defined in the section as being any tribunal, authority or person having power to require the production of documents. The Senate is clearly an authority having power to require the production of documents. Liberal Party members are again at it. They are deep down in the sewers, trying to force the commission of criminal offences by using the forms of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is part of a pattern. We have honest John Howard running around the countryside, accusing the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of behaviour which brings the standards of this House into disrepute. That is what he is saying. He is saying that the government and the Prime Minister behave in a way which brings this House into disrepute. Who abuses the forms of this House more often than anyone? Who ignores the standing orders of this House more often than anyone? It is certainly not the Prime Minister. Some people on the opposition front benches could well qualify as being those who have no respect for the forms of this House, the chair of this parliament or the laws of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the way opposition members are behaving. The member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), as part of the overall strategy of the Liberal Party&mdash;led by honest John Howard&mdash;breached both decency and law. Yet opposition members came in to defend him. This is the norm. This is the pattern of behaviour the conservatives of this country are now running on. Let us not run away from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mayo (Mr Downer) came in here and said, `There is one standard for the Labor Party and one for us.' Let us see who breached those standards. Let us see who in this parliament breaches the law. Senator Baume broke the law&mdash;no ifs, no buts, no defence. The law clearly states that it is an offence to disclose the tax file number of any person. There are no ifs, no buts, no excuse and no argument about it&mdash;Senator Baume did break the law. Today Senator Chapman is trying to force the National Crime Authority to break the law. These are two examples of where the opposition members have total disregard and disrespect for the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, there is the member for Barker, who has total disrespect, not just for decency, morality or feelings, but for law. Yet the member for Mayo says, `There is one standard for us and one standard for you.' Frankly, your standards stink. Your standards are appalling. Your standards have clearly been demonstrated in this parliament to be abhorrent. The standards of the Howard-led Liberal government are demonstrably illegal, abhorrent and leading you into the sewers. For your behaviour, you give a pale excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened this morning when we convened in this House? On indulgence from the chair, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) stood up and ran a case against the Prime Minister. Where was the case? What was the argument? It was fallacious and not in accordance with the forms and procedures of this House. Even at the very start of today's sitting, we had a clear demonstration of the total contempt you people have of this House and its proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to what the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said relating to the information I provided to him about this government's hypocrisy. Pre-February 1988, the then health minister&mdash;the former member for Bonython, Dr Blewett&mdash;in an effort to discredit doctors, gave to the then backbencher, the now Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), a series of documents which he proposed to use in his role as chairman of Labor's price watch committee. The now Assistant Treasurer was at that time running a campaign against doctors that was associated with this government's attempt to reduce the burgeoning cost of Medicare. As is always the case with such campaigns, the strategy was: attack the providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Blewett, either mistakenly or deliberately, handed over documents which, in the first instance, seemed to have come to him illegally from the Health Insurance Commission. Section 130 of the relevant act makes it illegal for the commission to pass on such things as provider numbers but that information was given either to Blewett or to members of his staff. He handed them on to the now Assistant Treasurer who used them publicly. They were caught. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only would those provider numbers give access to all sorts of details about what individual doctors have been charging; they would also give access to information about patients against whom doctors had been levying those charges and the services involved, which could relate to embarrassing sexually transmitted disease or whatever. But they got caught. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came into this place and questioned the minister, and the minister admitted what he had done. We sought to censure him.

They all came in here, notwithstanding their protest today, and voted in favour of the release of that sort of confidential information, notwithstanding that they passed an act, which includes section 130 that says it is illegal to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the morality of this particular challenge. In fact, those people voted that way. One who was caught with his fingers in the till was the Assistant Treasurer, and he came into this place and participated in the debate. It is unbelievable. All your names are here. That is one thing about this place&mdash;everything is on the record. That is how you voted. Let us put the morality of this issue aside. On both occasions the parties have claimed innocence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a day when we level charges and this is a debate where we level charges at each other. Words have been used in this place by the member for McEwen such as `the Liberal Party has sunk deep into the sewers of Australia'. In the history of Australia&mdash;from my recollections of the history of Australia&mdash;the greatest depth to which any politician has sunk deep into the sewers was when John Helden MLC rose in the upper house of the state parliament of Western Australia to attack two women on behalf of a constituent. The constituent had a long record of being a Labor Party hack. His name was Brian Easton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a background to all of that. The two women being attacked were sisters. They were both government lawyers. One was the ex-wife of Brian Easton. At that time, the other was working for the Legal Aid Commission in Western Australia and had been appointed to represent the interests of women who had been defrauded by a woman called Robyn Greenberg, who conducted a form of building society called Western Women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These women had been defrauded. They had been recommended to go to Robyn Greenberg for financial advice. Many of them came with the pittance of their divorce settlement or maybe the inheritance from the death of a husband and were told by a government instrumentality called Women's Information Referral Exchange to go down to Robyn Greenberg because she was a female financial consultant&mdash;a woman who had been through two previous bankruptcies&mdash;and take her advice as to how to invest their money. They did seek her advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She invested it for them and then stole the money. She is now in gaol for having stolen $3 million. These women were trying to recover from the government of the day, the then Labor government under Premier Carmen Lawrence, that money. They had a heap of evidence that they had been advised by a government agency to invest with Robyn Greenberg's Western Women. Just prior to this date, I think it was 22 November 1992 or thereabouts, and Helden raising these allegations of perjury against these women in the parliament, Margaret McAulay, one of those women, the lawyer representing the interests of these women, went to Premier Lawrence and told her that the case was insubstantial. </PARA>

Margaret McAulay told me she has never seen a person so angry as Premier Lawrence after receiving that advice. As history records, Premier Lawrence refused at any time to settle with those women. She was eventually out of office when the Court government took up the proper responsibilities of government and settled with them. </PARA>

He took information to the parliament which attacked a woman called Penny Easton, the ex-wife of Brian Easton.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely absurd for Senator Baume to maintain he did not know the tax file number of Peter Macdonald was on the document. He must have known. Is he trying to tell the Senate that someone of his background, who spends so much time raking over personal details, who spends so much time studying private documents, would not have noticed that the document had on it the tax file number of Dr Peter Macdonald?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if we accept his absurd and ludicrous assertion that he did not know the tax file number was on the document, the point is that the tax file number is only there to protect the sort of personal information that Michael Baume tabled in the Senate. He had absolutely no regard, like the rest of the Liberal Party and the National Party in the 1990s, for privacy, for personal dignity and personal arrangements. He was prepared to use any method at any cost to bring down Peter Macdonald in the state seat of Manly. The Liberals could not beat him on the substance and what used to be in this country the mainstream of political debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the same Michael Baume who came to this parliament in 1975 after a seedy and undistinguished career with the infamous Patrick Partners. As we all know, under the present laws of the Australian Securities Commission, if any stockbroking firm now carried out what Patrick Partners did then, it would be charged. This was the shoddy practice of producing TV programs to induce people to buy shares with the offer of a bonus payment. He has not changed one little bit. Had the airing of Peter Macdonald's tax file details occurred outside the parliament, Senator Baume would have been charged and criminally punished for his act. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 makes it an offence punishable by two years imprisonment or a fine of up to $10,000, or both, for the unauthorised disclosure of a person's tax file number. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

Our new colleague enjoyed the largest swing in modern political history in Australia.

How appropriate, in the middle of this debate about the shameful acts and behaviour of Senator Michael Baume, that this new member should be sworn in. It is so typical of the Liberal Party in the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) pointed out earlier, it is not only a question of the ethics and possible criminal behaviour of Michael Baume; it is also a question of tracking down the smear and smut trail of those in the Liberal Party who assisted Baume in this act. Those involved in sighting and treating in the leaked tax documents may be guilty of a criminal offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know from this debate the identity of the campaign manager for the Liberal Party in the state seat of Manly.

We all know that the seminarians worked him out nice and early when they sent him out the door backwards. But he has been involved&mdash;much more than defrocked but totally implicated&mdash;in this campaign of smear and innuendo against Dr Peter Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This House, in my assessment, not only should be censuring Senator Baume but also should be censuring the member for Warringah because the smear and smut trail in coalition politics is so clear to see. Michael Baume, a protege of the rodent himself, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), and the member for Warringah, a self-confessed and self-identified Baume protege, have been treating and dealing in illegal documents. The member for Warringah is totally and utterly obsessed with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on matters of tax and property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great interest to note his comments earlier in the debate and note that he is the best known monarchist and supporter of the royal family in this parliament.

How seedy, how hypocritical, how rotten of the member for Warringah to come into this House holding up Michael Baume as his role model, holding up the Leader of the Opposition as his role model&mdash;with the smut and smear campaign tracking itself all over the parliament right to the Leader of the Opposition's door&mdash;when, in his own arrangements, he is the beneficiary of not one but two tax minimisation devices: the Abbott family trust and the Tony Abbott family trust.

Is it because he does not think he is getting enough protection from the Speaker, or is it just another method of protecting him from the real anger of the Australian people? Minister, will the Prime Minister ask Priscilla designer and Oscar winner Lizzie Gardiner to design the guards' new uniforms?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to defend Senator Baume today, I might say that it amazes me that more people in this place have not read the following books: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bold Riders</EMPHASIS> by Trevor Sykes, John Pilger's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Secret Country</EMPHASIS>, and two other books, about what happened in this country during the 1980s. Trevor Sykes, a very reputable person in every way&mdash;I do not think anyone in this House would deny that&mdash;said in his book that $16,000 million was lost to some degree to the benefit of about 20 people whom he names in the book. During that period the banks lost $28,000 million. To give you an indication of where that money went and how this money was allowed to go to these areas, I will refer to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazine article on corruption&mdash;not in Australia but in another country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me hark back for one moment to the fact that the result of $28,000 million being lost by the banks during the 1980s by being loaned out to various people and the money then vanishing was that one in four farmers has gone broke and been forced off his land since 1986. Over 800,000 small business families in this country have been broken over the last eight years. In my electorate there were two suicides last year. One was a person being hounded by a bank; he had to shoot his cattle because of the drought and he then turned the gun on himself. The other was a young man, the son of a prominent grazier family in the area. Like every other family, they were finding it very tough. Only last week we had the deplorable case mentioned in the House by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) where a young man who was about to be foreclosed on by the banks locked himself in his homestead. The reason that this is happening in Australia is that $16,000 million was creamed off by 20 men. If you go through the list of 20, you will see that about half of them were prominent beneficiaries of the Australian Labor Party. In fact, they served on committees to raise funds for the ALP; and I can name them in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> magazine article. It was an article about the corruption that exists in Indonesia. The Australian press is wonderful at casting aspersions on countries like Indonesia. This article says that it is possible that this person could have blown away as much as $200 million of public funds on a project. He had friends, maybe even in the ministry, who facilitated money from government instrumentalities to go into a petrochemical plant project. This was horrific. It demonstrated how endemic&mdash;and it was the worst case yet&mdash;corruption is in the Indonesian government. He may have got away with $200 million. It was alleged in the article that this was simply a device dreamed up to take money out of the public purse and put it into private pockets, and some of that money went back to government officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the petrochemical plant project, because that is what we are talking about today. We are talking about corruption, and those people who have the courage, aggressiveness, energy and surveillance to be able to stop corruption from occurring in this country, and Senator Baume is one of those people. I refer to the petrochemical plant project which is before the courts in Australia. It is not speculation; it is reality. Effectively, it involves two men: Laurie Connell, who was the head of fundraising for the ALP in Western Australia; and Dallas Dempster, another prominent bankroller of the ALP in Western Australia. To say that he bankrolled the ALP in Western Australia but not federally is to insult the intelligence of every person in this House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, they had this great scheme for a petrochemical plant project. I am sure that they were definite about building it. They sold this project to the Western Australian government for $392 million. The liquidator moved in later on, as it did in just about everything in Western Australia, and liquidated the assets of the petrochemical plant project. The liquidated assets of the petrochemical plant project totalled $11 million. These two men had effectively pocketed $381 million. Indonesia is terribly corrupt, but in Australia, of course, we have a very clean government. We do not have that sort of thing happening in Australia. If that is endemic, and that is the worst example yet of corruption in Indonesia, all I can say is that it must be a very honest government compared with the government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on and talk about Bell Corporation. The beneficiary of Bell Corporation now sits on the Reserve Bank of Australia where, undoubtedly, she was put by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I have it on very good authority that he used to stay with them when he was visiting Western Australia when Robert Holmes a Court was alive. Bell Corporation was sold to instrumentalities of the Western Australian Labor government for&mdash;depending upon which article you want to choose&mdash;$360 million, $465 million or $260 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It rolled over dead two years later and not a single cent was paid out to the shareholders in that corporation, which of course were the taxpayers of Western Australia. A delightful article, I think in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS>, said that the stories about it were wildly exaggerated and that, in fact, the taxpayers had lost only $160 million to the owners of Bell Corporation which, substantially, was the Holmes a Court family&mdash;only $160 million!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are just two examples. I could sit here for the next half-hour and quote examples from these truly magnificent books which disclose what happened in Australia during the 1980s. I ask myself&mdash;and historians in future years will also ask themselves&mdash;why nobody in this place had the courage to stand up and say, `This has got to stop.' These were government instrumentalities, government banks. It was the job of the Reserve Bank of Australia to stop this from happening. That is why the Reserve Bank exists&mdash;to act as a watchdog in overseeing all of the banks in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again and again in those books you will see reference to the fact that the Reserve Bank failed to take any action whatsoever. That was particularly glaringly obvious in the case of the savings bank of South Australia, as it was in all of these other cases. One must ask why the Reserve Bank did not act. Why did the people who were paid a king's ransom to oversee and stop this from happening allow $28,000 million of people's hard-earned savings to go up in smoke in deals of this nature?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume has had the courage to speak out. He faces a very serious defamation action. Unfortunately, in Australia the defamation laws are different from those in any other country. We do not have a freedom of speech principle in our laws in Australia. I strongly commend the High Court action. Maybe one good outcome of the terrible events of the 1980s is the fact that the High Court has now moved in the Theophanous case to virtually abolish defamation action where matters of public interest are involved. So we are moving into the same situation as applies in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rather enjoyed some of the comments that have been made. Ray Martin interviewed me and said, `How would you like these things to be said about you?' He referred to some of the things I had said about some other people, and I burst out laughing. That was not the sort of reaction he expected from me. I said, `That is extremely mild compared with the things that I have been called and the concerted attacks made upon me, my family, my character and my honesty over the last 20 years in the state house. And you must be the only journalist in Australia that is not aware of some of those attacks because they made the national dailies on a number of occasions.'

He told me that Mark Le Grand had applied to tap my telephone and Senator Chapman's telephone. If Mark Le Grand was supposedly leaking to us, it would be very funny for him to apply at the same time for wire-taps on our telephones. That is how well informed the ALP is. </PARA>

After we spent $65 million, the courts decided that $26,000 had gone astray!</PARA>

He had used his plastic fantastic to take people out to dinner. That was why Brian Austin, a human being, was put in a steel cage for two years of his life&mdash;he was sentenced to four years and he served two years of that sentence. </PARA>

The articles said that the Prime Minister had a $20 million interest in the piggery. A journalist said to me, `Oh, well, he borrowed the money.' I said to the journalist, `How much money could you borrow?' When I eventually forced him to name a figure, he said, `$200,000.'

<PARA>Scarborough House has not undergone any major refurbishment since it was constructed in 1970.

Report 335 contains copies of the two Finance minutes received by the committee during the 1994 calendar year. As many members will be aware, the Finance minute process is the mechanism by which the government responds to many of the recommendations contained in the committee reports. The only recommendations which are not responded to by a Finance minute are those which address policy matters. Recommendations of this nature are responded to separately by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the Finance minutes contained in report 335 has already been tabled separately, but they are reproduced here in an annual consolidation for ease of future reference. The Finance minutes deal with the committee's reports on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">an inquiry into the Australian Taxation Office; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">its reviews of Auditor-General's reports tabled in the period May 1991 to September 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Finance minute on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report No. 326&mdash;An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS> was tabled in parliament on 20 October 1994, together with comments by the committee. Report 326 was the result of the first major public examination of the administration of taxation laws in Australia since the enactment of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In its report the committee sought to introduce balance to a system which it saw as having grown to ignore the people it serves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When tabling the Finance minutes in October last year I noted that the vast majority of the 88 administrative recommendations had been accepted and were being implemented. I can now advise the House that since that date the committee has taken steps to continue its interest and involvement in the reform process generated by report 326. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first was to invite the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, to brief the committee on progress in the implementation of those recommendations which had been accepted. The briefing took place in December 1994 and at that meeting Mr Carmody undertook to provide the committee with regular progress reports. The first of these reports is due shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other step we have taken is to announce a watching brief over the work of the tax law improvement project. The improvement project was established by the government in response to one of the key recommendations in report 326&mdash;that the Income Tax Assessment Act be rewritten and simplified. The improvement project has already produced impressive results with its simplified rewrite of the substantiation provisions of the tax law. Just yesterday the committee was briefed by officials from the improvement project on their proposed framework for the new income tax assessment law. The framework, which will be released for public discussion in late April, promises to be a major step forward in the process of producing clearer and simplified tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of the committee's watching brief is to examine the concerns raised by some in the tax profession that, because the improvement project is not authorised to consider policy matters, it will be unable to deal with the problems inherent in the current tax law. The committee intends to seek submissions from interested parties on this issue in the coming weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Finance minute reproduced in the report I have just tabled is in relation to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report No. 330&mdash;Review of Auditor-General's reports, May 1991 to September 1992</EMPHASIS>. Report 330 contained the results of the committee's review of the 72 audit reports tabled from May 1991 to September 1992. The committee is pleased to note that 10 of the 12 recommendations contained in the report have been accepted or accepted in principle by the relevant agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue of concern to the committee arising from report 330 is an apparent inconsistency between:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Health Amendment Bill 1995 amends the National Health Act 1953 to continue the benefits achieved in the last four years of the agreement with community pharmacy. The bill reflects the fact that both community pharmacy and the government recognise the importance of the current agreement in being able to make fundamental changes to community pharmacy, and the need to continue those changes. The current agreement has provided the incentives and the stability to allow these necessary changes to occur in an environment of cooperation and planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This agreement has provided assistance to over 600 pharmacists to voluntarily accept payment to hand back their approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits. In general, these pharmacies have been the smaller, less viable pharmacies which adversely impacted on the cost of supply of pharmaceutical benefits. The agreement has encouraged pharmaceutical services to be established and maintained in isolated areas. Over 400 pharmacies in isolated areas now receive extra remuneration to assist in meeting their higher costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement has produced a period of stability during which government and pharmacy have not been locked in conflict over remuneration issues, a situation that has unfortunately dogged past relationships. This has given both pharmacy and government the opportunity to explore the beneficial role of pharmacy in health care for the community at a time when community health care is changing rapidly. Noticeable now is the recognition by the pharmacy organisations of the need to monitor the performance of community pharmacy and to measure the outcomes of their activities in health care. In other words, pharmacy is moving from a reactive to a pro-active service to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will allow these changes to continue while building on the experiences gained from the current agreement. Both the government and pharmacy agree that the number of approved pharmacies is now at about the correct level and that the closure and amalgamation payments should cease. The ratio of pharmacies per 1,000 population is now within the range of international figures, unlike the higher levels previously experienced. It is now a matter of continuing to encourage a good distribution of pharmacies rather than the clumping that has occurred in the past and that still exists in some areas of our capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve this distribution, the current controls relating to the relocation of pharmacies are to be relaxed so that developing areas around the capital cities and other growth areas can be provided with appropriate pharmaceutical services. It is expected that these relocated pharmacies will come from the presently overserviced areas. To encourage the provision of pharmaceutical services in rural and remote regions, the incentives for pharmacies to operate in isolated areas will be continued under the legislation. The bill will permit simpler procedures for approved pharmacists wishing to sell a business or change the ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other cases, the valuable work and successes of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority will be maintained. The authority will be reduced in membership and its name will be changed to the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. It will continue to use the experience of hands-on pharmacists to advise the secretary on applications for new approvals and on relocations of approvals. The criteria for these considerations will, as is the case under the present agreement, be set out in a determination made under section 99L of the National Health Act 1953. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to be confident that pharmacists who supply pharmaceutical benefits maintain adequate standards of practice. The bill will permit the secretary to apply conditions for holding an approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits, primarily applying standards of practice developed by pharmacy itself. The bill also introduced the ability of the minister to agree to professional allowances for specific professional pharmacy activities outside the pharmaceutical benefits supply functions. One such area is medication review of residents in nursing homes, a very important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, in making a determination concerning the remuneration of approved pharmacists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits, is required to give effect to any agreement in force between the minister and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on this matter. This provision in the legislation is to continue in operation. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up too much of the time of the House to discuss the National Health Amendment Bill, which the coalition does not oppose. The National Health Amendment Bill 1995&mdash;and I must say that I have noticed the name change&mdash;is the enabling legislation for the new pharmacy agreement between the Commonwealth and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, as the professional association of retail pharmacists. It replaces the agreement which has operated since 1991 under which the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority has presided over a major shake-out in the retail pharmacy industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill replaces the authority with a new Australian Community Pharmacy Authority which will make recommendations to the government on applications to supply pharmaceutical benefit items, the payment of allowances in isolated and rural areas and the payment of allowances for specific professional services. The bill will also end the financial assistance program which has operated under the present agreement to facilitate the restructuring process. I am advised that that process has seen the number of active pharmacists in Australia decline by about 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition notes that this agreement will introduce two new allowances to replace the essential pharmacy allowance. These new allowances are the isolated pharmacy allowance and the remote pharmacy allowance. We see the importance of ensuring pharmacies continue to operate in areas which may not be as financially attractive as other locations. Therefore, we support these allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also introduces a professional allowance which will give some recognition of the professional activities of pharmacists outside the supply of drugs, such as participating in drug evaluation trials and the simple giving of professional advice over the counter. We welcome this wider conception of the role of pharmacists in our community&mdash;a role I wholeheartedly support and endorse. I should add that we also have no objection to the government's amendment extending the life of the new agreement by one year. This is welcomed by the industry, as the longer period will create greater commercial certainties for retail pharmacies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, we do not oppose the bill, because it is sound and, more importantly, it has been negotiated with the Pharmacy Guild over a period of time and is quite acceptable to the players involved. In this regard, the government is to be congratulated and I commend this consultative approach to the portfolio minister in respect of other areas of health that we will be debating in this House later today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this bill, however, the government has certainly fallen short of best practice in some respects. We are going to the wire with this piece of legislation as the new pharmacy agreement is still unsigned&mdash;I understand that this will happen later today&mdash;and the agreement itself comes into force on 1 April 1995. That is this Saturday. As a result, my office has received many queries from colleagues and from pharmacists themselves, particularly those who would be seriously affected by the sudden delay of the remote and isolated pharmacy allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough for the government to be bringing this legislation through the House 36 hours before the deadline. We are also aware that negotiations between the government and the Pharmacy Guild have been protracted, having opened as long ago as November 1993. Indeed, cabinet only approved the agreement last week. Meanwhile, thousands of pharmacists have been hanging on anxiously as the bureaucratic wheels ground on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am concerned at the way that this reflects on the government's treatment of this parliament. We are here now rubber-stamping an act of executive government, which still requires a major agreement to be signed. While I appreciate the cooperation that I have received from the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in relation to this bill, the government cannot walk away from the fact that it is operating, in the passage of this bill, on the assumption that the parliament will simply be a rubber stamp for the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reminds me of our debate last year on what is now the Employment Services Act 1994. In that instance, you may recall that the government passed enabling legislation to establish the Employment Services Regulatory Authority to oversee its job compact. Yet, on the weekend before the bill was debated, there was an advertisement in the national media seeking a chair for the authority&mdash;a position eventually given to one Joan Kirner. That advertisement appeared before the parliament had passed the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the explanatory memorandum to this bill is simply unprofessional. A prose rendering of each provision of this bill, a mere jargonistic paraphrase, gives little understanding of the operation of these provisions. The general outline is little more than a very vague narrative. This is something which has been raised in this place before, by my colleague the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I want to raise it specifically in relation to the explanatory memorandum provided by the Department of Human Services and Health which has been circulated in this place in the life of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous)&mdash;who has a respect for the processes of this place&mdash;to take this concern back to his minister and to make the point forcefully to the Department of Human Services and Health that it should get its act together. It may be a small thing, but it reflects the dim view that the executive arm of government has about the members of this place. I, and my coalition colleagues, simply say to the government that, whatever the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) may think, Australia is a parliamentary democracy and we in this place are the people's representatives. By showing disdain for the representatives in this place, the government shows disdain for the Australian people. It shows that disdain at its own peril, as shown by the swearing in of the new member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a very short debate on the National Health Amendment Bill, but I note that the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has felt so strongly as to move a second reading amendment. I am rather surprised at that. He puts forward an interesting case. He says that he agrees with every feature of the bill, in particular with such very important matters as the question of pharmacies in isolated places, the special allowance and the professional allowances for pharmacists.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems as though, on the basis of the second reading amendment, there is some misunderstanding on the part of the member for Chisholm about the procedure here.

All we have said is, assuming that to be the case in the general structure&mdash;we have not concluded the negotiations; we are going to conclude the negotiations after the bill is passed&mdash;that the passing of the bill will give us the opportunity. So I am not sure why he says that we have pre-empted the parliament and that the parliament is a rubber stamp. It is not a rubber stamp in these matters.

<PARA>This bill reflects the continuing commitment of this government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, referred to in schedule 1 of that act, may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the act came into operation in 1977 a total of 58 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this bill would be to bring within the schedule to the land rights act that area of land which is the subject of the Hodgson Downs land claim. The Northern Territory government, the Northern Land Council and claimants in the land claim have entered into an agreement which settles that land claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the land rights act to grant the claim area, excluding the Hodgson River road and the Miniyeri community access road, to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the land rights act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill we are discussing this afternoon is the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2). The purpose of this bill is to add one parcel of land to those granted to Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. The land is situated in the Mataranka region, south of Katherine in the Northern Territory. The land, with an area of some 3,232 square kilometres, is of cultural significance and contains a number of sacred sites. Known as Hodgson Downs, the area is under pastoral lease from the Northern Territory government and is used as a cattle station. It has a population of 240 Aboriginal people, and was purchased by ATSIC in 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because all interests in the property are held by or on behalf of Aboriginal people, a land claim over the station was able to be lodged under the provisions of the original act. In effect, this bill seeks to convert the title from the Northern Territory leasehold to Commonwealth freehold. Despite its opposition in principle to the lodging of land claims over Aboriginal owned cattle stations, the Northern Territory government in August last year agreed to a settlement of this land claim without the need for a hearing by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a positive development for a number of reasons. Not only did the Northern Territory government do something which for once showed a bit of thought in dealings with Aboriginal issues; it also saved a considerable amount of time and money. Most importantly, however, it will enable the handover of title to take place while the elderly traditional Aboriginal owners are still alive, something upon which they place enormous importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As already noted, because all parties agreed to the station being granted to an Aboriginal land trust under the act, there was no need for a hearing by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner. Therefore, the only way for the station to be granted a trust was by means of an amendment to schedule 1 of the act. Therefore, this is a very clear and well thought out process and a very positive development, and this government is pleased to bring this bill before the House to achieve this purpose. In enacting this bill, the government sees the practical and positive manifestation of our policy towards indigenous Australians and the broader goals of our social justice policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the opposition is supporting this legislation and therefore there is not a lot of controversy with the bill. Although in the scheme of things in this House it may be seen as a minor piece of legislation, for the Aboriginal people concerned it is a very major and positive development, and I am pleased that we are able to pass it with  bipartisan support in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are talking about the issues of land and social justice, I would also like to take the opportunity of congratulating the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation on the great document that it released last week called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Going forward: social justice for the first Australians</EMPHASIS>, which is in response to the request that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to come forward with some ideas about what it believes should be put in the social justice statement that the government intends to make later this year. I am very pleased that my friend and colleague the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the Liberal Party representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, is here because I wish to convey to him my personal congratulations on the important role he played in achieving this document. I must say that I think it is an act of bravery on his part that he has signed it on behalf of the Liberal Party, endorsing&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see. It is brave to have endorsed all of the recommendations in this report, because there are some quite significant recommendations. I look forward to the Liberal Party of Australia supporting the implementation of many of these recommendations. I am not sure which ones of these the government will pick up, when they will be picked up, and what the process is. The government, of course, has only just received the document and is considering it in detail, as we have similarly just received the ATSIC document, which is its submission to the government on the social justice statement and also contains some important points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think is so important about this booklet&mdash;and if other honourable members of the House have not yet read it I would urge them to do so&mdash;is that it puts together in one very valuable document the way forward for achievement of reconciliation. This House has unanimously endorsed the principles and the objectives of achieving reconciliation between the indigenous peoples of Australia and the non-indigenous peoples of Australia and this document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Going forward</EMPHASIS>, gives us the very clear pathway towards achieving that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might use the term radical for some of the suggestions in here which will provoke discussion and debate, which was the very purpose for putting them in the document. As a parliament and as a House we need to have our preconceived ideas challenged from time to time. We need to do a little bit of lateral thinking. I do not think enough lateral thinking occurs in politics in this country. This document sets forward some very important and valuable suggestions. It does not say, `Thou shalt do this. Thou must do that.' It is not a letter of demand or an ambit claim by Aboriginal people. It is meant to be a means of promoting and stimulating discussion and consideration of very important issues, and I think people need to understand it in that context and not just summarily reject out of hand certain suggestions that are made in the book, without really thinking about what they are trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this parliament and in the greater public domain there has been a lot of debate and discussion about constitutional reform and the Prime Minister is on the public record stating the agenda that he believes should be achieved in constitutional reform. One of the important things that is set out in this booklet is the plea by indigenous people in this country, saying, `If you are going to consider constitutional reform, you need to also consider indigenous Australians.' If you read the constitution of Australia, it ignores the very existence of an indigenous people. In 1991 the High Court of Australia pulled us up and told us that the myths that we had based our constitution on had to be torn up; that we had to face the reality that when European people first settled in this country there was prior occupation and ownership of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court forced us to do that because this parliament failed in that respect. Now we are saying that, if we are going to give some real meaning to that High Court decision, we need to look again at the constitution. We need to write within the constitution a recognition of the importance in the current structures of government of the prior occupation of this continent. I as a member of this parliament respect and strongly support those structures, but they are built on ignoring the fact that there was a prior civilisation occupying this continent which had a very strong culture and a very strong identity, and it has rights. Our constitution needs to recognise the existence of these people and that they were the owners of this continent. These people need to have their rights respected and recognised in the constitution. That is a very important issue that I think we in this parliament need to take up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The document also raises a few other issues which I am sure some people are going to be a bit hesitant or nervous about. It talks about the lack of any parliamentary representation for indigenous people. Only one indigenous person has been elected to the federal parliament of Australia, and that was a senator from Queensland who represented the Liberal Party, Senator Neville Bonner. In 94 years of national parliament, with 1,000 or more politicians elected to either the Senate or the House of Representatives, it is a disgrace that there has been only one indigenous person in parliament. It is a disgrace that all political parties&mdash;my own included&mdash;need to think about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to accept the challenge this document has set us. We need to accept that our political structures and the way in which our political parties operate are very exclusive. They exclude a lot of groups. In the way they operate, in the way they select members and in the way they select representatives for political office, most mainstream political parties in this country exclude indigenous people. We need to address that. This document says that we need to work around the great undemocratic injustice that exists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as representatives of major political parties should get Aboriginal and Islander people into our parliament and our parties, standing not just for major indigenous electorates&mdash;and there are a few electorates in this country which you may believe an indigenous person should represent&mdash;but for major urban electorates where there may not necessarily be large populations of indigenous people. Indigenous people with qualities, merit and ability should be elected. But our processes at the moment operate to make sure Aboriginal people do not feel comfortable about our political parties. They do not join the parties, they do not work within the parties and they certainly do not stand for political office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document has suggested that, to correct that anomaly, that undemocratic symbol, we may need to consider reserving seats in the parliament for indigenous people. It is not saying, `You shall do it.' It is not saying, `We demand this right.' It is saying, `This is something you need to consider.' It is floating the idea and saying, `We want you to seriously consider it.' That there are no indigenous people in this parliament is a very clear symbol of the lack of fairness, equity and social justice in this country. We have 223 parliamentary representatives in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Not one of them is an indigenous Australian. Indigenous people make up some 1.65 per cent of the population of Australia and a representative proportion of them in the parliament would be at least three people, probably four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This booklet is saying that indigenous Australians are entitled to have three or four members of the parliament. It is saying that if mainstream political parties are not prepared to look at themselves and do something about this situation, perhaps three or four seats should be reserved in the federal parliament for indigenous Australians. That is not a unique concept. New Zealand has tried it and, while there have been some problems&mdash;I am not sure whether it is the way to go&mdash;I would not reject the suggestion out of hand. There are certainly things about the present situation that we need to seriously consider because it highlights one of many anomalies that exist in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians tend to pride themselves on being an egalitarian and fair society&mdash;basically, we are&mdash;but there is one huge anomaly in that image and that is our treatment of indigenous Australians. I have participated in many debates in this parliament about the way in which we need to go forward. My views on Aboriginal health, housing, land rights and opportunities for employment in mainstream occupations are all on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the parliament to seriously consider the submissions made by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in this booklet, titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Going forward</EMPHASIS>. Since it was not tabled in the parliament it does not appear on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> as an item for debate. However, because it outlines the agenda set by the council, it would assist if members included it in their contributions in debates on Aboriginal issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another issue relating to land and recognition of Aboriginal interests, I would like to spend a few moments to comment on the issue which cost the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) his shadow portfolio. The way in which those events unfolded, backbench members of the parliament did not have an opportunity to comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was greatly disturbed by what occurred. I will not use this opportunity to try to score cheap political shots&mdash;that is not my style&mdash;but there are some very serious fundamental issues which, as a parliament, we need to look at. One of those issues is about respecting the rights of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the International Year of Tolerance. Unfortunately, I do not think our parliament has exercised much tolerance in the first three or four months of this year. What most disturbed me about the events that unfolded with respect to the secret letters and the matters associated with them was not only the opening of private mail&mdash;that has already been heavily canvassed&mdash;but also, and more seriously, the absolute contempt for people's sacred religious beliefs that was demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me, it was like someone walking into St Peter's Cathedral and spitting on the altar. It was that type of action and it should be viewed as being as contemptible as that action would be viewed. It was a sign that some people in this place are prepared to go to any lengths to score political advantage and will use anybody's personal, private, secret, religious beliefs or views to distort a situation to their own political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the member for Barker should have resigned. I know that he misled the House and formalities demand that if you mislead the House you give up your position. That is the reason he gave for resigning his position. But he should not hold any further shadow ministry position because he demonstrated such a clear and total contempt for the religious and sacred views of another group of people in our society. For that reason, he should never seriously be contemplated for another senior position in the opposition. His actions demonstrated that he does not have the personal qualities that Australians want to see in someone making important administrative decisions about the affairs of people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important piece of legislation. I am pleased the Northern Territory government has supported it coming here. It is an interesting development for the Northern Territory, particularly when one looks at some of the other things the Northern Territory government has said. The Northern Territory government does not have a good record in its administration of Aboriginal affairs. It gains significant financial resources from the Commonwealth but is not expending those resources appropriately or in the way in which they were originally allocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is of little surprise when we hear statements from people such as Shane Stone, a member of the ruling party in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. He said that all the problems in the Northern Territory were the federal government's fault because we like to support Aboriginal people and we have a view that is strangling business interests because we are actually trying to give the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory some opportunity to live in a reasonable environment and to develop and assert themselves. One must remember that the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory account for more than 25 per cent of the population in the Northern Territory.

For those in the gallery, it is two paragraphs and, although I have not counted them, there are probably a couple of hundred words. It is a very straightforward bill, at least superficially. It says that under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 a particular portion of land, by agreement between the Northern Territory government, certain Aboriginal people and the federal government, will be transferred to Aboriginal ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the 59th or 60th piece of land that has been so scheduled under this act in the last 18 or 19 years. I think we in this place all acknowledge that transferring land is a critical part of Aboriginal culture. They have a special attachment to the land, but the legislation has far more practical and, in my view, more far-reaching implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government, the Northern Territory government and the indigenous people concerned have all agreed on this issue, so it is not contentious, and we could pass the legislation fairly quickly through the House. But it is important to look at some of the underlying features that are relevant to this piece of legislation and like legislation in action. The legislation was passed by the Liberal government in 1976 when the then minister was Ian Viner, who, to the government's credit, was recently appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, which council produced the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Going forward</EMPHASIS> that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton, referred to at some length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about passing land to Aboriginal people, it is more than just handing over a deed or a bit of paper and sitting back and forgetting all about it. There are some fundamental issues here. All members of this House, without exception, and increasingly the general public, will understand that the indigenous people in this country&mdash;a small percentage of the population&mdash;are, by any yardstick, significantly disadvantaged compared with the rest of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average male life expectancy is 18 years less than the broader community&mdash;for women it is 15 years less&mdash;and there is overcrowding in houses. The parliamentary secretary at the table, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is sitting across the chamber, and I have been to communities where we have seen 20 or 30 people living in quite small three-bedroom houses with limited sanitation and so on. There is an almost permanent unemployment rate in Aboriginal communities of 70, 80 and sometimes 90 per cent. You do not need a recession to make it bad in Aboriginal communities; it is a fact of life throughout life. Aboriginal women have diabetes at a rate eight times that of the general population. In many Aboriginal schools 50 per cent of the children will have middle ear infections. So they have a health problem and an education problem, because if you cannot hear you certainly cannot learn. One can go on with the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will recall that only recently we had tabled in this place a comprehensive report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which documented in really quite appalling and frighteningly awful detail the disadvantages of indigenous people in this country. We all understand that it is a significant problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the sad things that I have learnt in the five years I have been in this chamber&mdash;a number of measures have been put in place over the years to try to address some of these problems&mdash;is that, as I go around, I do not see any real evidence that the situation is improving significantly at all. Certainly, the statistics do not suggest the situation is improving at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the government, which I have acknowledged previously in this place has good intentions to try to resolve the problems, in the last 12 years it has been here has not been successful in the various things it has done to improve the lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We have had a number of initiatives. Money has been spent, organisations like ATSIC have been set up and health, education and language strategies have been put in place, but the reality is that those things have not worked very effectively at all. Therefore, we need to look at some new ways of dealing with that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, and most Aboriginal leaders whom I talk to have a very strong feeling about this, we have to break the welfare mentality&mdash;the fact that we just hand out money and people take it, and often it is regarded as sit-down money, but they still have nothing to do with their lives; that they are still living in appalling conditions; that they do not have the infrastructure or the sanitation; that the local council does not empty their dustbins; that the attendance rates at school are appalling; and that there is alcohol and substance abuse. For example, in the Pitjantjatjara lands I saw four-year-old kids sniffing petrol. It is quite appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of things are going on all the time. We have to try to break this whole cycle of poverty and disadvantage, and we will not improve the situation while we take what I believe is a paternalistic view and just hand out money and think that that will fix it. We have to look at some underlying changes to our philosophy. For example, in the whole criminal justice system, a 15- to 19-year-old Aboriginal youth is far more likely to be in gaol or in custody in some shape or form than a non-Aboriginal of the same age. It has</PARA>
<PARA>nothing to do with the colour of the skin. In a country where there is disadvantage in terms of employment, health, education and all those things, Aboriginals are going to get into trouble with the law anyway. But in Western Australia an Aboriginal of that age is 50 times more likely to be in custody than a non-Aboriginal of that age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had inquiry after inquiry. We had the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, with 339 recommendations. The government has allocated millions of dollars to implement those recommendations. The government, the opposition and the state governments have accepted almost all those recommendations, and we have had voluminous reports tabled in this parliament every year saying how much effort has gone into implementing those reports. But the reality is that the bureaucracy has gone mad but we are not seeing much change on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is important that we start to look afresh. It seems to me that we have to get installed&mdash;or reinstalled&mdash;into the Aboriginal psyche in some shape or form some self-esteem, some pride and some determination to try to help themselves. That is not to put them down. But we cannot just say to them, `Here is some money. Get on your way.' We need to have a number of initiatives in place that will involve the Aboriginal people in decision making and in decisions of how money is spent. They also need to be given help from the ground upwards. We need to put in place a number of preventative measures rather than trying to fix problems after they have occurred. </PARA>

But, rather than having national health strategies that come from the federal government and go via the state governments&mdash;with regional bodies and ATSIC involved in the act and political stoushes as to whether the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), or ATSIC via the minister, have control&mdash;we ought to be looking more at the simple things that will fit in with Aboriginal culture, and we should put some responsibility in the communities so that people's time is occupied and they will start to take an interest in their welfare. For example, perhaps far more money should be put into community nursing so that the nurse goes along to the house and makes sure that little Johnny is eating properly, that the hygiene standards are in place and that he has his jabs when the doctor tells him to, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental change of attitude is needed. We need to get back to some more simple, straightforward, basic approach to dealing with some of these matters, and we have to get the Aboriginal community itself committed to doing some of those things instead of always sending in outsiders. Obviously outsiders will be needed for training, but we need to get the bureaucracy out of the way and some practical action in place on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to Aboriginal people, if we are going to get them to take a larger degree of responsibility at the ground level for a number of these matters, that we give them self-respect and pride, that we get them off alcohol, and that we give them things to do in terms of work. It is important, therefore, that we acknowledge some of the symbolic things that will restore that pride and self-esteem. The grant of land is one way, and that is what this bill is all about. But other things need to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), referred to the report of the Council of Aboriginal Reconciliation <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Going forward</EMPHASIS>. One of the things mentioned in there is that there should be a recognition, in the preamble to the constitution, of indigenous prior occupation and ownership of this country before European settlement took place. It is an historical fact. It seems to me that, when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was set up, just such a preamble was included in the legislation. I have not noticed the heavens fall in since that legislation was passed, and I very much doubt if the heavens would fall in if it was in the constitution preamble. But it would be an important symbol for indigenous people to have that sort of recognition. It seems to me that, unless you undertake a few important symbolic things as well as some of the practical things, then you are never going to get on top of the problems and issues that I have been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker also referred to representation in parliament. The council did not recommend that there be separate indigenous seats in the parliament. It said very specifically that it was an issue that was raised by many indigenous people during the consultation process. It is an issue that, in consultation with the wider community, a number of people raised as well, and it is therefore something that needs to be looked at and understood, and perhaps debated. If there is general community and bipartisan support, then you would perhaps go to a referendum to give effect to that. But, if there is no general community support, the council says you would not proceed because it would be divisive&mdash;and that does not do anybody any good, particularly the indigenous people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of things in the report that emphasise the sort of thing we are talking about in this bill in terms of land and also indigenous people's basic rights&mdash;the same rights anybody who sits in this chamber would have. We all have normal expectations that our dustbins will be emptied, water supplied, our roads made up, sewerage facilities supplied&mdash;all those things&mdash;and, as citizens, Aboriginal people should also have those things. The report also talks about Aboriginal people having rights to acknowledgment as well. I do not think any of us, if we are treated as second-class citizens, would have the self-esteem to be able to get ourselves out of some of the practical problems that would then beset us, and Aboriginal people are no different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we pass a fairly straightforward, simple piece of legislation such as this, it is important to remember the underlying issues that are behind it. It is not just a question of saying, `Here is a bit of dirt that we are going to give to Aboriginal people.' That is important. They may live on it, they may work it, they may or may not make profits out of it, but it is part of an overall package of activity. It is an amendment to a piece of legislation of which the Liberal Party has always been proud&mdash;and justifiably so&mdash;and it is part of an ongoing battle to try to make sure that we do treat our indigenous people better. I certainly commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

The purpose of this legislation is to transfer it to the Aboriginal people, the traditional owners of that land, and the people who occupy that land.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Aston is one of the better informed members of the opposition in relation to Aboriginal people in Australia. He is one of those relatively few members of the opposition who have some sympathy for Aboriginal people, some understanding of their background and the circumstances which they face as a minority people who originally owned and occupied the whole of the Australian land mass 200 years ago. Some say the Europeans invaded; others say they settled. I do not think the question is so important. Certainly, the opportunity occurred 200 years ago for white Europeans to take from the Aboriginal people in Australia, sometimes under horrendous circumstances, land which those people had previously occupied and owned. I think it is to the credit of those three organisations that that agreement was reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not always the case that agreements between responsible people and responsible organisations in Australia are able to be achieved in order to achieve, in turn, a proper outcome for those people most affected by it. It is interesting that we are amending the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which was introduced initially in 1975 by the Whitlam government. That legislation followed the findings of a royal commission which was appointed by the Whitlam government in 1973. The royal commission was chaired by Justice A.E. Woodward and became known as the Woodward royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of that royal commission were essentially incorporated in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1975, which was introduced by the then Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Les Johnson. In the process of introducing that legislation, Les Johnson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the field of Aboriginal affairs, this is undoubtedly the most important legislation ever to be introduced into the Australian Parliament. While several States have moved towards the recognition of Aboriginal land rights, this legislation goes much further than has previously been contemplated in Australia. This Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission&mdash;the Woodward report&mdash;and grant land rights to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory. It will provide for freehold title over all reserves and certain other lands to be vested in Aboriginal ownership and give Aboriginals control over what happens on their land, including control over mining developments.</PARA>
<PARA>Major political changes took place after that, with the sacking of the Whitlam government at the end of 1975, and that particular legislation lapsed. Fortunately, it was reintroduced under the Fraser government by the then Minister Viner. The interesting thing is that, while the opposition continues to claim credit for many of these initiatives, an examination showed that it so frequently sought to thwart, frustrate and obfuscate&mdash;to place obstacles generally in the way of&mdash;significant initiatives being taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That October 1975 Labor land rights bill followed 15 months of investigation by Justice Woodward. It followed a further 18 months of consultation with Aboriginal groups. In the process of Labor dealing with that legislation, the coalition opposition, the conservative opposition, sought to refer the bill to a standing committee for a further report. That is typical: delays compounding delays. That has always been the tactic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It disappoints me because I know that there is goodwill on the part of many members of the opposition in connection with Aboriginal people, Aboriginal interests and Aboriginal rights. But they make collective decisions which are intended deliberately to place obstacles in the way of significant initiatives being introduced and significant initiatives being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1976 Mr Ian Viner introduced the Aboriginal land rights bill which followed on, as I say, from that Labor legislation which was initiated during the period of the Whitlam government. In November 1976 debate was resumed by a conservative coalition government and that government itself was responsible for introducing 42 amendments. A conservative coalition government introduced 42 amendments in 1976 after it became responsible for that legislation. We do not need much more evidence than that to prove the claim I make that, to a very large extent, the conservative coalition's position in relation to many of these issues concerning Aboriginals and Aboriginal interests would appear to be less than genuine. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . something which I see as important and which Mr Justice Woodward saw as important, and that is a recognition of a fundamental principle to Aborigines&mdash;their sense of Aboriginality was their affinity with land.</PARA>
<PARA>Increasingly now that is being recognised. It was recognised in an important and historic way by the High Court in its Mabo decision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that there appears to be an impression that, right from the start of British and European colonialism&mdash;when they invaded, occupied and expropriated the land of native people, wherever that happened to be&mdash;there was a failure to recognise those interests. That is not so. Initially, to a very large extent, the rights of indigenous people, wherever they happened to live, were respected and were expected to be respected by those people who acted on behalf of the Crown. Let me give some examples. George III&mdash;who was the King of England towards the end of the 18th century, at the time that Australia was first `discovered' by Cook&mdash;in 1763 said:</PARA>

<PARA>George III, a British monarch, was making a declaration about the rights of native people in their own lands to be respected&mdash;not to be molested&mdash;by those people who acted for George III as the monarch of England.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing this Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2), I wish to review the role played by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 in the ongoing debate on Aboriginal land rights and mining. At the outset I wish to state unequivocally that there is no benefit for Aborigines or other Australians in politicising this issue or in taking an extremist position. The sole aim of any person who enters the debate should be to move the issues forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard no-one who has seen the survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population recently released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics could fail to be moved by the implications of those stark facts. I remind the House that the report noted an unemployment rate of 38 per cent overall with a rate of 50 per cent for those Aborigines aged between 15 and 19 years. Of the 40,200 unemployed persons, 77 per cent had been unemployed for three months or longer, and over 50 per cent had been unemployed for 12 months or longer. Examining health related issues, the survey found that 17 per cent of rural Aboriginal households did not have doctors available at all, or that they were available less than once per month, while 54 per cent did not have access to dentists and 74 per cent did not have mental health services available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a truism that there is no simple panacea to improve this utterly unacceptable situation. Aboriginal communities are diverse with very different needs and circumstances. For example, more than 50 per cent of the Aboriginal population across the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland live in communities of 1,000 or less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those communities there are widely differing government jurisdictions and employment opportunities and many other historical, cultural and social factors contributing to their present situation. Such complexity defies simple analysis, yet it is my belief that the issues are becoming clearer, particularly as they relate to economic advancement for Aborigines. For instance, there is a clear perception among the community and decision makers that economic advancement provides a significant platform of opportunity to benefit Aborigines. The entitlement to the safety net of welfare assistance is a right that no needy Australian should be denied, yet beyond the safety net economic independence is the cornerstone of self-determination for any community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The granting of land rights through the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 was a significant step towards economic advancement for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, particularly through mining ventures. This act established mechanisms for negotiating the exploration and mining of minerals on Aboriginal lands and the use of the resultant royalties for Aboriginal advancement. The act created Aboriginal land trusts to receive grants of inalienable freehold title to Aboriginal land, with property rights to minerals retained by the Crown. Land councils were also created to act as agents for the traditional owners on land matters and to negotiate terms and conditions for exploration and mining with an independent arbitrator if an agreement could not be reached. Equivalent amounts to the mining royalties returned to the Commonwealth or Northern Territory governments were to be paid into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forty per cent of the funds obtained were to be divided between the land councils as general funds, with 30 per cent to be paid to the land council in whose district the mine was located, and intended for the affected Aboriginal community. The balance of 30 per cent was to be distributed between Northern Territory Aborigines as a whole, as payments to cover administration of the trust account and as further payments to the land councils if they could not cover their expenses from other payments. Anyone wishing to explore for minerals or acquire a mining interest over land granted to Aboriginal owners had to negotiate through the relevant land council. The act provided that the consent of the relevant land council and the Commonwealth minister was required before either exploration or mining was allowed on Aboriginal land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its proclamation on Australia Day 1977, the act has been subject to considerable amendment. In 1987, in response to claims that the legislation was unworkable and was inhibiting resource development in the Northern Territory, the act was amended to remove the right of Aboriginal owners to veto mining if they had previously agreed to exploration. Amendments at the same time required traditional owners to decide on new mining proposals within 12 months, with the possibility of extension. If an exploration proposal was rejected, then no further applications could be made for five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the Industry Commission, in its report on mining and minerals processing in Australia, examined the operation of this legislation as it applied to mining investment. In addressing the effectiveness of the legislation, the Industry Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The holding of land rights by Aborigines may lead to smaller levels of mining . . . activity in the Territory relative to those which would have occurred. However, provided Aboriginal landowners face appropriate incentives, it would be wrong to conclude from this that land and sub-surface resources were not being devoted to their socially optimal use. In this sense, the . . . real test of the workability of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 is not necessarily the amount of land under exploration, or the number of mines on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, but rather the extent to which Aboriginal landowners are able to freely exercise their ability to withhold or grant consent for exploration and mining.</PARA>
<PARA>The key point that I wish to draw out of this conclusion by the Industry Commission is that, for natural justice to prevail, the traditional landowners must be able to make a completely informed decision on an exploration or mining proposal. Thus they must be able to assess the incentives offered by the developer, negotiate on these incentives and then decide whether the benefits outweigh the possible disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looked at this way, the point of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act is to facilitate the negotiation process so that all parties achieve a positive outcome.

Does the Prime Minister agree with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, who said a short time ago in Sydney that popular concerns that the Australian economy is in danger of lapsing into our old boom-bust ways, with the current account careering out of control, are legitimate concerns for policy makers at this time?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can think of no better example of form rather than substance than the little stunt the Leader of the Opposition just put on here. I have read the speech and I have my own markings on it. There are a number of references to monetary policy and wages. Mr Fraser says he believes the government will introduce a good budget. He is correct in that. Mr Fraser said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of current government projections, the budget deficit would decline from 2.7 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to a surplus in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident the government will deliver an improvement of at least this order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A government member&mdash;</EMPHASIS>Exactly.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Earlier, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Viewed in these terms, a good budget could be seen as easing the pressure for possible further monetary policy tightening. That is true. But even a good budget would not necessarily rule out further interest rate adjustments. For one thing, we could not be sure that such a budget would cause the economy to slow sufficiently, partly given the favourable effects it could have on confidence generally.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that a well delivered and well received budget will actually add to confidence itself, and that that may be a spurt to growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is he saying that? One of the reasons he is saying that is that he was Secretary to the Department of the Treasury in the 1980s. As the government kept reducing those big budget surpluses and cutting government spending, as that contracted from activity on the public sector side of the economy, it added to private sector activity because there was far more confidence about the economic settings. That is the point he was making there. It is a sophisticated point. That is why it got past you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fraser also has some references to wages, which I agree with. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think some commentators assume too readily that there will be major slippage on wages.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with him on that. The record has shown that this government has introduced a contestable economy in this country by removing tariff barriers and by introducing enterprise bargaining. We are getting natural growth in productivity and that is holding down wage costs. As well as that, we are seeing a general understanding by the work force about wages growth. Mr Fraser is talking about four to five per cent. When the Leader of the Opposition was last Treasurer, it was 16 per cent. Is it any wonder we were uncompetitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point&mdash;I made it in a speech last night but let me make it again today&mdash;in the period between 1983 and now, Australia's international competitiveness has improved by 40 per cent. In the eight years between 1975 and 1983 it increased by nothing&mdash;there was no change in underlying competitiveness during the whole period of the opposition leader's tenure as Treasurer. In the years since, our competitiveness has improved by 40 per cent. So when Bernie Fraser makes&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can he advise the House whether today's current account deficit figure is consistent with official forecasts? What do the components of the current account deficit indicate about future growth prospects?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2567" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's current account figures for the month of February are quite consistent with the mid-year review forecast for the current account outcome for this year. As well as being consistent, we have an outcome which has some encouraging signs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it is five per cent less than for the previous month, which is a good development. Also, the composition of the factors that produced that outcome are quite encouraging. Merchandise exports increased by four per cent but merchandise imports increased by only one per cent. Clearly, the movements in that area are in the right direction for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to exports, I make a couple of points. Firstly, the impact of the drought is showing through, particularly in regard to cereal exports which, in the last three months, are 43 per cent down on what they were in the same three months of the previous year. We are seeing drought having quite an impact in some areas of rural exports, particularly in relation to cereals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, total exports for February were at their highest level ever. There are some encouraging signs in regard to non-rural exports. The figure for non-rural exports was the highest ever. For non-rural commodity exports, which have been trending down for the year to September of last year, we are seeing increasing signs that that is being reversed. We are seeing a pick-up in both volumes and prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rise in imports of one per cent was entirely due to imports of capital goods, which went up by 13 per cent. That, of course, reflects the fact that investment is growing strongly. With a 24 per cent increase in investment now forecast&mdash;a figure that the opposition said was impossible to believe; it said that 14 per cent was impossible&mdash;we expect to see strong capital imports. That is what we have here. That is a good thing, because it means we have a greater capacity to sustain economic growth and employment in the future. It also means that we avoid high capacity utilisation ratios. If you have very high ratios, it means that there is a situation in which inflation can easily take off. Imports in areas such as consumption goods are down six per cent and imports of intermediate goods are down one per cent. So, on the import side, the general picture shows some degree of encouragement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to have sustainable growth for the future. It means lesser growth than the five per cent to six per cent growth that we are currently experiencing&mdash;a point that Mr Fraser made in his speech. I can say in that respect&mdash;and since this is the last sitting day before the budget&mdash;that the budget will be designed to achieve a more sustainable rate of economic growth. It will be designed to achieve a better balance of demand and growth so that we do not have demand spilling over into imports. It will also be designed to achieve a structural improvement in savings in this country so that we can continue to experience substantial growth without a balance of payments constraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one other point. I notice the Greens have been saying that they will not cooperate with the budget, in the sense that they do not think we need to have a reduction in the deficit. They do not believe in the twin deficit theory. We are not pushing twin deficit theory here. We are not saying that it automatically follows that if you reduce the budget deficit you reduce the current account deficit, but we do say it goes in the right direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key issue here is the savings investment balance. If you have strong investment, you need to have stronger savings. If you do not do that, you will certainly have a large current account outcome. In the circumstances we face with strong investment, it is crucially important that we improve our savings performance. That is what the budget will, in part, be designed to achieve.</PARA>

But since then Australia has been whacked with a further $130,000 million worth of current account deficits and our foreign debt has doubled to $162,000 million. In 1990 you deliberately engineered the worst recession since the Great Depression to solve the problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of the change, this is the first time, the first period, in Australia's history where rural and resource exports form the majority of our exports&mdash;the very first time. This is the first time when manufactured exports and services predominate in the Australian balance of payments and balance of trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an enormous structural sea change for Australia. It occurred by a shift in manufacturing production, manufacturing exports and exports generally which has improved our capacity in relation to the current account. The terms of trade have been running against Australia for a long time. That is, in the early postwar years the things that Australia traditionally exported commanded very high prices and the things it imported commanded low prices. Therefore, our standard of living rose. In the 40 years since the war, we have had a complete reversal of that: the things that command the high prices are the products with intellectual innovation in them and the things that command the low prices are the bulk traded commodities&mdash;agriculture and minerals&mdash;and this has seen our terms of trade fall dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the constant fall in those terms of trade that the Liberal Party, when in office, never picked up on. The Liberal Party made no change to our manufacturing structure to make the adjustment for when it happened. The salvation coming from higher exports and from the shift in the composition to manufacturing and services was delivered by this government. It was delivered by this government because, had we relied on the same composition of exports as John Howard was prepared to rely on from 1977 to 1983, Australia would be absolutely dead in the water. We would have a recession prone and massively interest rate ridden economy of the variety we have seen in other parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change was the belief on this side of the House that the notion that you could not have a competitive manufacturing sector sitting beside an internationally competitive primary exports sector was a nonsense and that, by a change in our education system&mdash;a change in participation in education and tertiary education and in research and development&mdash;our product innovation would rise and, with a 40 per cent change in competitiveness, we could find exports of manufactures and exports of services growing.

The burden of the question from the honourable member was about the consequences and impact of interest rates on his electorate. The matters that we debated earlier in question time&mdash;references to things said by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the attendant outcome on inflation, his references to wages&mdash;are the core matters in respect of interest rates. Who has the policies to keep wages growth in this country consistent with low inflation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We got it there. Why would you say not us? The other question is whether, in terms of activity in the economy, the early, but I believe timely, increases in interest rates by the government to slow the recovery and make it sustainable have not in the long run been entirely in the best interests of the economy and the community at large. As a consequence of the things the Treasurer eloquently said earlier, the government will, between now and the next sitting of the House, bring in a budget. Both he and I have said that the import of that budget will be, we believe, to make further interest rate increases less likely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is only one way to low interest rates in this country; that is, through low inflation and a proper balance between the demand and supply sides of the economy. I cannot tell the honourable member&mdash;because he was not around at that time, obviously&mdash;this was never so under his party in office. The Leader of the Opposition, when Treasurer, had wages growth of 16 per cent, and he did not know what to do about it. When the last big wage round came through, Malcolm Fraser caught a plane to England to see the royal wedding; do you remember that? When wages blew out&mdash;they were right on the table&mdash;instead of staying and fixing it and dealing with it or doing his best, Malcolm Fraser jumped on the plane and went to the royal wedding. The wedding present we got was the 16 per cent wages growth which followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why interest rates peaked under the now Leader of the Opposition at 22 per cent. It is no mystery where the 22 per cent came from; it was the high inflation from the 16 per cent wages growth plus the real interest rate. When you compare that to 10 per cent or nine per cent interest rates today, or 8 3/4  per cent for bills, it is a far cry from anything the federal Liberal Party was able to deliver. I hope for your sake that your party can understand what the influences on inflation are and understand that no mayhem wages system will deliver wage restraint and at the same time, in the doing of that, produce high productivity which reduces wages costs and holds inflation down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think they are the central matters in the price and inflation equation. I hope that, as I did sitting in that place so long ago at his age, he can come and learn some of the lessons of economic policy as we saw the Liberal Party's disasters occur one after the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you this little bit of commentary on history: in the last year that the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, he was the most worried person in the world. After we became the government he was the happiest, because all of a sudden the burden had shifted to some crowd who could actually do something about it. He works on the basis that if you stay here long enough the cycle will repeat itself. That is the one part of the lesson you should not take any notice of.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. Preliminary indications are that unmet demand for university places will be down eight per cent this year over last year. There are two significant reasons why that circumstance has come about: firstly, we have put more places into universities; and, secondly, there are far more jobs available for people to choose to go to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant indicator is that, since 1983, the probability of a student completing year 12 and going on to university has doubled. It has gone up from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. It has gone up because of our policies. Our policies have been committed to massively expanding the higher education sector; policies that we will persist with and that we have developed without having to resort to up-front fees for undergraduate students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last election, the Liberals went to the campaign on a policy of fees and vouchers for funding universities. Their justification then was: `If we allow overseas students to pay for places, why don't we let our own students pay for places?' Where is the equity in the argument which says that our own people have to pay up-front to get into universities? Where is the equity in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week we have seen a surprising about-face by the opposition in this direction because the shadow spokesman on higher education, Senator Hill, does not believe in fees any more. In a radio interview on 28 March, in justification of this position, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that the situation has changed somewhat in that there has been a stabilisation of the number of students, there is not the demand now.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a simple point of contrast between that statement, which was made on 28 March, and what the Leader of the Opposition had to say just four days before. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the big problems with tertiary education in Australia is that every year there are thousands of young Australians who are shut out of tertiary education and there aren't enough places.</PARA>
<PARA>His shadow spokesman said that we do not need to raise fees because there are sufficient places; yet he said four days before that there are not enough places. The message out of that is twofold. The first is that they will say anything to suit the occasion and the second is that, if demand for places does go up, the Liberal Party will resort to fees to fund them, because the only basis upon which it has ruled them out now is that the demand does not justify it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The students also have another concern&mdash;that universities, through their commercial arms, are seeking by the backdoor to charge up-front fees. In the House yesterday I indicated quite clearly what our position was on that, but the shadow spokesman for the opposition, in relation to the backdoor approach, said that he has some sympathy for that position. Not only would the opposition bring back fees if demand rose, but it would allow far greater flexibility to the universities to charge for postgraduate fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple facts are these. The Liberal Party does not support growth in the higher education sector. It does not support equitable access to it and it does not support student organisations. Most importantly, on 23 February the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> summed up completely the Liberals' position when it said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bonython for his question. The Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that all young Australians receive an education which is both full and relevant. We have already achieved Labor's goal of encouraging more young people to stay at school to finish year 12. One out of three students used to complete year 12; now three out of four do so. These young people are now demanding, quite justifiably, further skills. With around one-third of them going on to university, the Commonwealth has been determined to make additional places available for vocational education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995 the Commonwealth is contributing $695 million in basic funding for TAFE through ANTA. We also contribute growth funding. This year we are making $310 million available, which brings to $820 million the Commonwealth's contribution to meet growth in the TAFE system since the agreement was signed. However, this growth funding is dependent on the states and territories maintaining their effort. We do not ask them to increase it; simply to maintain it.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2576" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has always been a conundrum for those people who want to see the best of our native forests preserved and those who want to see a viable forest products industry to be able to see themselves sitting beside one another in harmony. There will never be, in this policy, in this whole area, the capacity to serve everybody's aspirations completely. But this government seeks to try to serve them well. The government has considered, over a substantial period of time, all the issues involved in representative reserve systems and how we might keep a decent representation of species amongst particular stands of trees. At around half past four this afternoon I will be saying something public about it. The cabinet considered it at length again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the difficulty always in forest management in these terms is that the environmental imperative has been operated through the residual powers of the Commonwealth under the export powers. The Commonwealth is not a manager of state forests. It is because of this need to refer to state management systems and state managers of forests that there could never be within the Commonwealth a management system that would adequately serve the full expression of those powers. That is what this discussion has been about. With a lot of goodwill between ministers, departments and the states, we are seeking to come to the right conclusion about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in marked contrast to the coalition. When Mr McLachlan, as the former shadow minister for the environment, said recently that he was adopting a policy for the coalition against clear-felling of trees for land clearance, the Leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, said he would not have a bar of the policy. He overturned it completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also observe that the opposition spokesperson for the environment recently appointed by the Leader of the Opposition believes that the Commonwealth's external affairs power&mdash;its treaty power&mdash;should not be used in any way for environmental protection. That is, things like the Gordon below Franklin and the world heritage listings would not be there were we to see this person's view that the external affairs power should not be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if the Commonwealth were not to use the external affairs power or its external powers in respect to exports, or export licences for woodchips, then its influence on forest policy would be very greatly diminished, and that side of the argument which seeks to have a representative reserve system in our forests and the preservation of native stands of trees could not be served. That is the key point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has only been this side of the House which has taken the view that there has to be a balance between this&mdash;that we do want to see that but at the same time get to the position where we can have reasonable forest agreements where there are, on a scientific basis, the preservation of large, adequate reserve systems for trees. As a consequence of that, it would mean that we would not in the future be going through a coupe by coupe analysis of export approvals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But with the states tardy in coming into RFAs, regional forest agreements, there has been no recourse but for the Commonwealth to try to judge from this distance, as the non-operator of forests, which of these particular coupes can be made available for woodchips.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was, of its essence, always a complex matter, it always has been and it will be until we have representative forest arrangements, RFAs, across the Commonwealth. And, of course, Mr Speaker, you already know that the state where this has been the heaviest industry, Tasmania, has not even signed the national forest policy statement&mdash;Premier Groom has not even signed the national forest policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us not have anybody from the National Party, of all people, asking us about forest management. When the member for Barker made a reasonable policy expression saying that they would not allow continued clear-felling of trees, the Leader of the National Party said he would not have a bar of the policy, he would overturn that in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where they are coming from and that really means, in terms of this debate, they disqualify themselves on the basis of not being able to add to the debate in any meaningful way how we might keep these important native trees and, at the same time, end up with a sustainable wood products industry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question which, in some respects, is complementary to the previous question. The government's concern with ecologically sustainable development with the environment goes to the green issues; it also goes to the so-called brown issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions made and announced this week represented a very substantial step taken by the government towards achieving the target set for us&mdash;a target that will result in a reduction of 15 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000. As with other environmental issues, of course, that represents a balance between the interests of industry and what can be achieved at the environmental level. The package that the minister announced yesterday, I think, makes that balance in a way that has industry contributing very substantially through voluntary agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also has a substantial commitment of people working through rural based programs, particularly around Landcare and REEP, where something like $250 million will go into employing something of the order of 25,000 people in making their contribution through their programs to the reduction of greenhouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise very quickly, in answer to the honourable member, the importance of a longer term agenda which goes to urban issues. Fifty per cent of all emissions are essentially related to urban life and the way that we live in urban society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the solution to the greenhouse issue lies in energy efficiency in terms of industry and it lies in the billion dollar tree planting program across Australia. But it also will depend upon our capacity to green our cities. Urban forests and forestation programs within cities play a very important role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, transport systems are important. It is important to see where improvements in urban public transport can contribute, just as the efficiency&mdash;or lack of efficiency&mdash;in housing can play a very important role and the Commonwealth, through the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, can demonstrate effective ways forward. Finally, what greenhouse is about is achieving outcomes over specific periods. We need to see how we can achieve that by working with the states in Commonwealth-state programs where Commonwealth funding is involved. Part of yesterday's announcement was to look at ways to legislate to ensure that, where we make contributions to major state programs, we look to the outcomes environmentally in terms of reducing omissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its statement, the government indicated that it can achieve a great deal through the measures announced. But, in the longer term, we need to think more about what we can achieve through the urban environment. I think many people in the community will take very seriously the agenda in yesterday's statement. I encourage them to look at that part of Greenhouse 21C. It will be very important to environmentalists who operate with, are thinking about and are concerned with the brown agenda as well as the green agenda the Prime Minister referred to in terms of forests.</PARA>

That is why the Senate count goes on and on for weeks after the expiration of the statutory 13 days that we have to wait for postal votes. But hopefully no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under `Easy count' the AEC advises me that it will take the computer just two hours to do all those weeks of counting. The new system can be used in all states for the Senate. Party scrutineers will be reassured to hear that under `Easy count' a detailed audit trail of the entire counting process will make their jobs much easier. The keying in process for each ballot paper will be by two independent operators with the computer cross-checking any variation in their entry on the ballot paper. I think the House will be pleased to hear that the proposed change will not cost anything for the taxpayers. In fact, there will be a saving of $375,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer confirm his promise to the ACTU that any compulsory employee superannuation contribution will be accompanied by a taxation trade-off? If the Treasurer cannot confirm this, is this not just one more instance of the government plundering wage earners of up to $6 billion on top of their already rising mortgage interest rates in a clear attempt to remedy its mismanagement of the economy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Far from plundering wage earners, real wages have been increasing for the last several years, although members opposite probably have not noticed that. We have been looking at a situation of improving real wages and improving real household disposable incomes. In the last couple of years we have seen very strongly rising real household disposable incomes in which wage earners have been participants. We are not talking about a situation in which people are suffering declining real incomes and declining living standards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there were ever any doubt in the Australian community as to the charge made against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) by his former numbers apparatchik, Graham Richardson, a couple of days ago on the John Laws program&mdash;I raise the John Laws program quite deliberately because, if ever there were a direct line into the Australian people which the Prime Minister periodically uses, it would be the John Laws program because it has a very wide coverage&mdash;it would have been put to rest by what Graham Richardson said on that program. He said that the Prime Minister had well and truly lost the plot and that he was no longer listening to the concerns of mainstream Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate demonstration of the accuracy of that statement was revealed today in the supreme self-delusion of the Prime Minister which lies at the heart of Australia's chronic inability to cure its current account deficit problem. For most of question time the Prime Minister invited the parliament and, through the parliament, the Australian people to believe that, when it came to parliamentary noise and the cut and thrust of parliament, he was an innocent abroad who was the victim of the rowdy tactics of the opposition and the incompetence of those in the chair. It is very instructive that at no stage did the Prime Minister deny reports of what he said at the caucus meeting about the incompetence of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker. All he sought to do was to claim that it was all our fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is very good at blaming other people for his problems. This week, which is only to Thursday, these are the people he has blamed for his problems: the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives; Graham Richardson; Bob Carr; John Della Bosca; Barry Jones; Ros Kelly; the voters of Canberra, that is 99,000 people; university students; the ACT Labor Party and the Legislative Assembly; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>; the journalists of the Canberra press gallery; the televising of parliament; and, most of all&mdash;you will love this, Ralph&mdash;lazy ministers. The trouble is that he is doing 90 per cent of the work. The last time I remember another Prime Minister of Australia blaming his ministers for his problems, he lost the election eight weeks later. I think it is a very bad habit that the Prime Minister has fallen into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The serious part of it&mdash;the real rub&mdash;is that, while the Prime Minister deludes, Australia burns. That is the rub. For 12 years we have put up with this hubris. We have put up with this man who is drunk with his own hubris and arrogance. We have put up with him day after day, month after month, year after year offering one more excuse and asking for just one more opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember when he went on the John Laws program nine years ago and declared that, if Australia did not tackle the current account deficit problem, it would become a banana republic. That was a call to economic arms; that was how the Prime Minister later rationalised it. I do not think that was his original intention. He is very good at the ex post facto rationalisation&mdash;like suggesting that, when our vote goes up in New South Wales by six per cent, which extrapolated would give us a gain of 11 seats, it is a disaster. That is one of the most monumentally deluded rationalisations that I have heard from the Prime Minister. But he has done the same with the economy. Back in 1986 he said that, unless we cured the current account deficit problem, Australia would become a banana republic. Nine years later, three elections later, 25 broken promises later, the Prime Minister is still saying that our major problem is the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you, Prime Minister: how long must the Australian people wait until you finally deliver on the promises you have made about curing the fundamental problems of the Australian economy? That is the simple question. The Prime Minister tried again during question time to run this fictitious line that, in some way, the current account deficit problem during the time that I was Treasurer was worse than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to have been given a set of the statistics. It shows that, in the seven years the Fraser government was in office, the current account deficit at its highest point, which was in the second last year of that term of government, was 5.6 per cent of GDP. During every other year it was below four per cent of GDP. Let me tell you what has happened since Mr Keating has been either the Treasurer or the Prime Minister of Australia. In 1985-86 the current account deficit was six per cent, 6.1 per cent, 6.1 and 6.1; in the pre-recession period it was 6.1, 6.4, 6.4 and 6.4. On most occasions, it has been way in excess of what it was on any earlier occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's current account deficit figure for February is $2.2 billion. For the first time in history, Australia has recorded four consecutive monthly current account deficits of over $2 billion. The current account deficit over the year to February is 50 per cent higher than it was for the corresponding period last year. This is the problem that nine years ago the Prime Minister said he was going to fix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why we have high interest rates in Australia is not only the size of the budget deficit but also that overseas lenders are charging a risk premium to lend to borrowers in a country whose current account deficit is the second worst in the OECD. Foreign investors regard Australia, when it comes to its current account deficit, as a bad risk. You cannot blame anybody&mdash;the Fraser government, foreigners, the British, Sir Henry Parkes or the prophet Moses&mdash;except yourself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have now been in charge of this country for 12 years and there comes a time of great political accounting. We saw a taste of your political future last Saturday right here in Canberra. That was a time of great political accounting, because what the people of Canberra said more than anything else was: `Prime Minister, we no longer believe you. We no longer trust you. We no longer have any faith that you can deliver solutions to Australia's problems. We want to send you a resounding message in no uncertain terms.' That is why they sent Brendan Smyth here with the biggest swing in modern political history in Australia. That is why, unless the Prime Minister stops sniffing his hubris herbs&mdash;until he comes down to earth and understands that ordinary Australians in the mainstream of this country are bleeding, and bleeding very badly&mdash;he will suffer the same fate as your Sue Robinson suffered just last weekend here in the city of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You no longer have any credibility when it comes to the current account deficit. You said in 1987 that the worst was over. You said in 1988 that the policy would continue to lower the current account deficit and so restore Australia's sovereignty over its own affairs. Sovereignty is a very interesting subject. It is something the Prime Minister is interested in. He keeps telling us that, unless we become a republic, change our flag and do what other people want us to do with our national identity&mdash;not what Australians want us to do with our national identity&mdash;we are not a sovereign country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What your Prime Minister has done in the last 12 years has been to more trade in and denude this country of real sovereignty than any constitutional set-up could possibly do. You have handed this country over to the foreign bankers of the world, you have handed us over to the bureaucrats of Geneva when it comes to the treaty making powers and processes of this country; yet you have the nerve to talk about national stature. Your Prime Minister has got the nerve to talk about Australians walking proud and tall in the world. I do not walk proud and tall in the world when I know that my country's foreign debt has gone to $180,000 million from a figure of $21,000 million back in 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, through the whole of the 1980s, the economy of this country was run at an unsustainably fast rate. You went into debt to an unacceptable degree in order to purchase an unsustainable increase in the number of jobs in this country. The net effect is that we still have in this country the most sustained level of long-term unemployment that we have had since World War II; we still have 800,000 Australians out of work; we still have an unacceptably high level of youth unemployment; and, on top of that, we have the highest level of foreign debt since the Great Depression. That is your legacy. That is your record. That is the achievement of your Prime Minister, Mr Deputy Speaker, over the last 12 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the people of Canberra said last weekend, and what the Australian people are saying all around this country at the present time, is that they no longer believe somebody who in 1987 said that the problem had been solved; in 1988 said that the policies were working; in 1990 said that the problem was no longer with us; in 1992 said that the basic challenges had been met and overcome; and now, in 1995, went down to Monash University last night and restates the problem all over again. You could write out the year 1995 and you could substitute the year 1986. Nothing has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those on the other side used to talk about how the Bourbons forgot nothing because they learnt nothing. If ever there were a Bourbon of Australian economic management, it is the current Prime Minister, because the rhetoric has not altered. Yet he expects us year after year to go on believing what he is saying. The fact of the matter is that the people no longer believe what he is saying. That is why so many of your colleagues are quaking in their boots this week. That is why you got that 17 per cent swing against you in Canberra. That is why your caucus members ravaged your Prime Minister. That is why all of those people queued up to give their doorstops on Tuesday morning as they marched into this building and told the Prime Minister to start listening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But do you think this Prime Minister is going to listen? Do you think anybody seriously expects the Australian public to believe that he is an innocent abroad when it comes to the rough-house of the Australian parliament? Do you seriously believe that anybody who asks the Australian people to think that he is put upon when it comes to parliamentary procedure could ever possibly summon a modicum of humility to say that he is sorry, to apologise to the Australian people for the fact that he lied to them and misled them, to apologise to the Australian people for promising them tax cuts at the last election, yet taking them away, and for telling them in 1987 that the current account problem was solved but admitting last night that the problem had not even begun to be solved? How on earth can anybody take such a person seriously? Yet, apparently, there are still some misguided people opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 12 years the Australian economy has been progressively handed over to the bankers of the world. A Prime Minister who boasts about the importance of national independence has done more to pawn our real independence than any Prime Minister in Australia's history. I do not think the Prime Minister has learnt anything from last weekend, because I believe this Prime Minister is incapable of learning anything. I think his long record of failure over the last 12 years, particularly in relation to the current account deficit, is eloquent testimony to that proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) say that any fool can create jobs if he is prepared to increase foreign debt. When the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, he certainly presided over a considerable increase in foreign debt, but he did not create any jobs. It takes a real fool to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Australian people come to make their judgments about the relative performance of the Labor government versus its predecessor, they will do well to look at the record of the previous government. I am not going to spend much time on it today, but since it has been made an issue by the Leader of the Opposition let us just recall the fact that, when he was in office as Treasurer for five years, there was growth of employment of 52,000 a year and that under this government it has been 154,000 a year&mdash;100,000 jobs more a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an extraordinary record when compared with that of the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. He thinks he can persuade the Australian people to believe that he can run the economy better than this government, when he has a record which is appalling compared with that of the present government. Whilst he was producing one-third of the rate of employment growth, he was doing it with an inflation rate of 9.7 per cent per annum compared with the average rate over our 12 years of 5.4 per cent. So he produced about one-third of the job growth rate and about twice the rate of inflation. That is the kind of record that he has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On foreign debt he is also saying that he is a bit of a cleanskin. That is not true. In fact, I can go to no better authority than a member of the Liberal Party, Mr Michael Warby, who wrote an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> in May 1994. In the footnote to that article Michael Warby is described as a member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party. In that article he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fraser Government's performance was, to be blunt, poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fraser Government presided over the period when high inflation, mass unemployment and plummeting national saving rates became entrenched, and growth in living standards stagnated.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a member of the Liberal Party Federal Council giving a one sentence summary of the performance of the Fraser government, of which the now Leader of the Opposition was a minister all of that time and Treasurer for five of the seven years. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . on foreign debt, the Fraser Government can clearly be held responsible for presiding over the start of the growth in foreign debt, which grew from 11 per cent of GDP to 21 per cent in a mere two years from June 1981 to June 1983. This rate of growth of foreign debt has only been briefly approached, and never exceeded, under the Hawke-Keating governments.</PARA>
<PARA>So here we have a prominent member of the Liberal Party saying publicly the truth&mdash;that there was this rapid growth of foreign debt as a proportion of GDP. In the last two years of the now Leader of the Opposition's period as Treasurer of this country, he had this explosion of foreign debt alongside an economy which was going through the floor. He had it wrong every which way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now a situation where the economy is growing stronger than any other country in the OECD. He had an economy which was going through the floor, going into recession&mdash;remember that 1982-83 was a year of recession&mdash;and soaring foreign debt. He had the absolute quintessential, awful outcome; and with that he had double digit inflation. This was an appalling end to the Fraser government. No wonder it got thrown out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, with the effluxion of time, people tend to forget all that, but it is very relevant to considerations of the relative weight that people should give to the two parties. This government certainly has been in office for 12 years and we will stand on our record over that period which, economically, looks fantastic compared with that of the opposition when it was last in government. It is a record which has produced for the Australian people a prolonged period&mdash;obviously there are ups and downs of the business cycle&mdash;of much faster employment growth than they ever had before under the Fraser government, much lower inflation and a tremendous reduction in industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some current account problems which we have been grappling with over that time and still are, as the Prime Minister said in his speech last night. We have not just been sitting there saying, `Here is a problem that the Australian nation has and we are not going to bother doing anything about.' We have been addressing that problem we inherited from the previous government of a structure which simply was not taking the Australian people anywhere. We were a developed industrial country with a Third World pattern of exports. We relied on things that you can grow and dig up out of the ground rather than value added commodities, goods or services for exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were overwhelmingly Third World in our pattern of exports, and that meant that we were facing a long-term decline in our terms of trade. We had to grow and dig up more and faster just to stay in the one place. As the end of the Fraser government period shows, as I already demonstrated, there was an inability at that time to stop a considerable increase in foreign debt. The terms of trade were adverse and we were facing a situation where Australia was going down the gurgler because we had a structure which simply was not suited to maintaining living standards&mdash;certainly in a relative way and maybe not even absolutely in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as producing those major changes on employment, inflation, industrial disputation and productivity improvement, this government has been about making a major structural change to the economy, which particularly shows up in the export field. We said we had to get away from the high protection policies which had been pursued in the past, bring protection down and make our manufacturing and service industries much more competitive so that they can compete and are not so reliant on commodities which are subject to supply and demand on world markets. Although they will always be important to us because we have that enormous comparative advantage in those areas, we simply can no longer rely on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had to structurally adjust the Australian economy in a major way to make our manufactured exports and service industries internationally competitive. That meant reducing tariffs, which meant a higher propensity to import. As tariffs keep coming down, obviously more imports keep coming in. This also means that our industries have to become more efficient or die. They have clearly become much more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturing industry is now able to produce not 10 per cent of exports, which it was back in 1983-84, but 17 per cent of our total exports. We have seen a very rapid growth of exports of manufactured goods. We will see a lot more of it in the future. That is of tremendous benefit to the Australian nation, because the price of manufactured goods on world markets is much better, when taking into account the long-term trends, than the price of commodities without much value added. It is very important to us to pursue that course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen service industries increasing their exports markedly as well. We have near balance on the services side with exports and imports. Tourism is the obvious example of a tremendous growth in an export industry. There are others: education, health and so on. These are major changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accusation of the Leader of the Opposition that the government was sitting there and unable and not willing to address the current account problem is massively untrue. No government in the history of this country has addressed that issue more than this government has. Certainly we do have a high current account now&mdash;at least that part of his speech is right&mdash;in comparison with most other developed Western countries. We are also growing faster than most of those countries. We are doing it at a time of drought. That drought is knocking some $2 billion off our exports. We are growing at a time when the rest of the world has not been growing rapidly. The prices for and volumes of our non-rural commodities have not been good. They are starting to pick up now, as the rest of the world lifts its game. Obviously that is a good portent for next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's figures, as I said at question time, show quite a deal of encouragement in that regard. We can look forward to an improvement in exports of non-rural commodities, and rural commodities for that matter, as, hopefully, the drought does completely break and the rest of the world has higher activity, and prices for commodities continue to increase. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics expects a nine per cent increase in commodity exports next year, or about $5 billion. That is clearly a great plus for the current account next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we have a combination of high growth and very high investment, which is capital intensive and which puts pressure on the current account. Temporarily we have this high figure. As the Prime Minister said in his speech last night, these long-term trends are encouraging for the future. The efforts which we have made to bring about the structural adjustment and develop manufactured exports in a big way are exceedingly important to the future of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absurd to suggest that this government is not addressing the issue of the current account. It is absolutely doing so. Part of that process is to improve national savings. This government has taken the major step towards the development of superannuation in this industry. That superannuation through the SGC is a major step forward in improving our national savings performance. The Fitzgerald report expected it to improve national savings by some two per cent in the longer term. That is a very important addition to national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that we will be pursuing an improved structural performance in the budget. You will have to wait until the budget to see exactly what that involves. I had already given that assurance to the House earlier today at question time. I repeat it. The budget will be about, in part, a structural as well as a short-term improvement in the national savings performance. We will be looking to reduce the deficit and so reduce public sector dissaving and improve national savings. That is important when investment is growing so strongly. We will also be trying to ensure that we improve the long-term structural performance on savings. That is what the nation has to do in the end if it is to bring about a major improvement in its current account performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the problem has developed over a long period. The structural change in the economy over the last decade or so is a key element in ensuring that we can overcome that problem and that we can grow strongly without a current account limitation.

<PARA>I will deal with the matter of the drought, the matter of the national debt and matters arising from the comments of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), and I will make some comments of my own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very sadly, we have reached a stage in this country at which the recovery is very fragile indeed. The drought is worsening. On the matter of the national debt referred to by the Treasurer: at no stage when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer of this country was the national debt anywhere near $25 billion. It was a great deal lower. In terms of ratios, it was in a better shape. To quote from the official documentation of the government, today that national debt is $162 billion&mdash;a sixfold increase in net debt terms or in quantum terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whichever way you look at the economic performance of this government&mdash;to take up the Treasurer's challenge&mdash;there is one other thing which the official ABS statistics show. It is a very sad statistic. The gap between rich and poor over the 12 years of federal Labor government in Australia has got greater. They are not my figures; they are the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is at arms-length from the government and even at two arms-lengths from the opposition. Those figures show that the gap between rich and poor is the true legacy of Labor. How left wing members can dare show their faces in this House and support this government in these circumstances, when they face the social inequities arising from the outcome of the Prime Minister's policies as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, is shameful. It is an awful legacy; it is one which you will pay the price for. You did pay the price for it in the Canberra by-election last Saturday. I congratulate the new member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) for taking his seat in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer also referred to structural adjustment. It must be some little time since he sat down with the shippers of this nation because, whilst with the introduction of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority there was initially a degree of improvement, the truth is that that has dropped off in the last 12 months. Shipper after shipper, freight forwarder after freight forwarder, will tell you that the ports of Australia in terms of efficiency are lagging behind best international practice by a country mile. We are lagging further and further behind, for example, one of our competitors in many commodities&mdash;New Zealand. The taxpayers had to pay millions of dollars as part of an equation to bring about waterfront reform, buy-out, termination packages and the like, only to find that the situation today is worse, not better.

The greatest since the Depression. We now have a current account problem again. So what do we have to look forward to? Another recession caused by higher interest rates&mdash;is that what this government has in store for us again? I hope not. The fact is that yesterday the Prime Minister said that eventually the current account deficit would decrease. How is it going to decrease? What policy prescriptions does this government have? What levers will it use to bring down the current account deficit? Again, the government is reaching, as it did three times late last year, for higher interest rates. That seems to be about the only lever it knows. That is why it got savaged properly in Woden Valley and elsewhere last Saturday. By the way, the truth about the New South Wales election results is that 11 federal seats held by Labor would fall to the coalition if Saturday's New South Wales voting was repeated at the federal level&mdash;and I think it will be. </PARA>

This is what I'm going to say: there's going to be a bounce back in exports as part of drought recovery.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he had listened to his Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) on the matter, who warned two weeks ago that for so many the drought is not over, then we might have had a more realistic assessment from the Prime Minister&mdash;a more realistic assessment of our prospective export performance, a more realistic change, alteration and review of exceptional circumstance provisions which are denied to so many across Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth taking into account that there are a number of factors which are, in effect, inflating the current account deficit at the moment, the drought being the most obvious one. Other factors are: lower commodity prices, following on the recession internationally, which are starting to rise in many cases and will continue to rise; the fact that we had a bit of an expenditure burst in the latter part of last year which flowed into imports, which I would see as a flow-on from the recession; and, finally, the burst of business investment which the Treasurer (Mr Willis) gave further details of in question time today. This clearly has been pushing the current account deficit a little further than it otherwise would have been, and it will gradually return to a level of equilibrium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, we have a problem but the magnitude of the problem is nothing like what has been suggested by the opposition. It needs to be put into some serious context. The context is nearly six per cent economic growth. There has been rapid employment growth, with 500,000 jobs having been created since the government was re-elected in 1993, a year ahead of the target that we set and which many ridiculed as simply impossible. There has been a 40 per cent increase in competitiveness since the government was first elected in 1983 and a 24 per cent increase in business investment. Real incomes have risen; irrespective of the sort of stuff that is said by some on the opposition benches, it is a fact. Low inflation has been sustained. The Australian dollar is still reasonably stable in the middle to low US70c range. There is clear evidence of structural economic change. This latest information, with respect to the contract signed by Toyota with countries in the Middle East, is yet another very good example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest example is the car industry, which the opposition would have removed all assistance from as a result of its Fightback package and let go to the wall&mdash;a car industry that is proving that it can both produce well and export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, we do have economic problems. But, looking at the total picture, we have economic problems that most Western governments would kill for by comparison with the sorts of difficulties they face with their levels of foreign debt, budget deficit, unemployment, inflation, interest rates and the like. In the total picture, we are outperforming virtually all other Western governments. </PARA>

The Liberal Party has had the former member for Kooyong's legacy hanging around its neck throughout the 1980s and now the 1990s even when he was not the leader. In 1987 he flirted with the Joh for Canberra campaign to help undermine the campaign by the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). In 1993 the Liberals decided to stay away from Andrew Peacock and, for a change, have a serious policy, but then they ran an Andrew Peacock election campaign and they lost.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the champion of the New Right, the self-styled most conservative leader that the Liberal Party has ever had. What is he doing? Running away and hiding from every policy debate that is before this nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this issue he is a man with a past&mdash;like on every other issue.

Where is the distinction? What is the difference?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is this: there was 10 per cent plus unemployment; 10 per cent plus inflation; business investment was dying; and interest rates were substantially higher than they are now. The total picture&mdash;and this is the emphasis that I place in this debate&mdash;was dramatically different from the total picture that we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is relevant to make these comparisons. It is true that a fair amount of time has gone by since then. Nonetheless, these comparisons are relevant. When he was in charge he had a current account deficit as bad as the contemporary current account deficit. But where were all the other good economic indicators that this government has been able to deliver? Where were the sorts of economic indicators that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) sneers at? Like the 500,000 new jobs that have been created. Like the prolonged low inflation. Where were those economic indicators in the early 1980s?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a leader who has turned himself into a policy fraud. The honourable member for Bennelong had some integrity in the 1980s because he stood for a hard right position, he articulated it and he kicked some heads in his party in order to do so&mdash;one of the reasons why the honourable member for Goldstein is here and not his predecessor. But now he is running away from it and descending into pure, populist nonsense and today was a very good example of precisely that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of engaging in the substance of the debate, instead of looking at the detailed factors of our current account deficit problem, it is pure, unadulterated populism. No serious economic analysis. Unlike his counterpart in Victoria, Jeff Kennett, when the election is called he will not be able to get away with going to the electorate with no policies. The member for Bennelong will not be able to get away with just simply presenting himself and saying, `Australia's got problems, and here I am. Aren't I wonderful? Please vote for me.' That will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When his policies are open to scrutiny he will be in trouble because not only will people have a track record to judge him by but they will have the real policies&mdash;what the Liberal Party really stands for&mdash;to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when looking at the current account deficit problem, yes, it is a problem. But you have to look at the total picture. You also have to look at short-term factors that are exacerbating the problem and that will alter. You have to look at the track record of the people opposite and see how much credibility they have in dealing with this issue. The answer is: not very much at all. To the extent that they had any credibility at all, it is rapidly dwindling as a result of the stance that they are taking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before interruption of the debate, I was speaking about the major contribution to the Northern Territory and Australian economies that the mining sector makes, and how this benefits Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Consequently, the question of access to land for exploration is one that will concern all Australians. In this context, it is instructive to review the status of exploration licences over Aboriginal freehold land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of 31 January this year, the Northern Territory minister had given consent for applicants to commence negotiations on 606 exploration licence applications since the proclamation of the Commonwealth act in 1976. Of the 606 licence applications, a total of 51 have been granted under the Northern Territory Mining Act. A further 14 have received approval by the relevant land council and the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and are awaiting grant. As well, 157 proposals for exploration have been vetoed, leaving 211 currently considered by the land councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not dispute for a moment that many of these applications will have had complex implications and that their consideration and negotiation are no doubt subject to unforeseen delays and difficulties. But, with only 8.4 per cent of exploration proposals granted, one has to at least question whether the act is providing Aborigines and other Australians with the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of mining ventures. This is especially so when you consider the high risk and low rate of successful commercial discoveries from mineral exploration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier in the debate, the 1987 amendments to the act were intended to ease the situation of land access for mineral exploration by removing the right of Aboriginal owners to veto mining if they previously agreed to exploration and by imposing time limits on the decision process. Unfortunately, there is significant doubt as to whether these amendments actually benefit any of the groups involved in the process. On the surface, the amendments seem to provide more certainty for mining interests in that they have a clear decision time frame and are not faced with the possibility of having invested heavily in exploration only to find the mining denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional owners have to make a decision to allow exploration and mining before the results are known. At times this makes revenue, employment benefits and disadvantages from mining very difficult to accurately quantify&mdash;sometimes impossible. Traditional owners will tend to be more hesitant to allow exploration on their land, resulting in fewer and more complex agreements. There are undoubtedly cases where a less constrained negotiation would have resulted in an agreement and the benefits of mining accrue to all parties. The opportunity to go the extra mile and reach a negotiated outcome beneficial to both parties is vital to the goal of Aboriginal economic independence and a healthy resources industry. In 1991, the Industry Commission commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiations without artificial external constraints would seem far more likely to result in mutually satisfactory agreements which adequately address the main concerns of both Aborigines and those of developers.</PARA>
<PARA>To my mind, there is no question that negotiation is the key to unlocking the benefits of mineral wealth for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. There is a vital need for greater freedom for negotiation between the traditional owners of land in the Northern Territory and mining interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In advocating this, I am not suggesting that the powers of traditional owners of land in the Northern Territory to determine their future and the future of their land should be weakened. The Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments have a duty of care to ensure that such negotiations are effective, fairly conducted and of benefit to all parties directly involved as well as to the wider community. To achieve this goal, it is imperative that all parties have as clear an understanding as possible of the implications of their actions and any agreement that may be reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few years, the power of negotiation and communication to cut through decades of mistrust has been impressive. For example, in 1993 the mining company Zapopan and the Jawoyn Association reached agreement over native title issues for the proposed $100 million Mount Todd goldmine, which is 50 kilometres north of Katherine in the Northern Territory. The successful conclusion of the negotiation process provides an important model for resolving other issues of this nature and followed a lengthy history of claims around the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1978, a traditional land claim was lodged on land in and around Katherine by the Jawoyn. When the land commissioner presented a report on the claim in 1987, the area of the Mount Todd mine was specifically excluded from the grant of land. Shortly after that report, two repeat land claims, which included the Mount Todd area, were lodged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Mabo decision in 1992, Zapopan sought legal opinion on the effect of the decision on the proposed mine, recognising the possibility of further native title claims to the area. Then, in November 1992, ongoing discussions between the company and the Jawoyn Association, which had been primarily concerned with employment and contract opportunities, became focused on the issue of land rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With legal advice that a repeat land claim would fail and that there was a limited chance of success for a native title claim, Zapopan chose not to pursue its interests aggressively but, instead, to seek a resolution through negotiation and discussion with the Jawoyn Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mount Todd result was truly a win-win situation for all concerned. It is worth commenting that the issue of land rights and native title was resolved in only three months of discussion between the parties, which compares very unfavourably with the delays experienced under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and the Native Title Act. I have no doubt that outcomes, such as those of the Mount Todd negotiations, have resulted from an increased awareness by developers of the importance of issues of native title and Aboriginal advancement, while Aborigines see the economic and social benefits of employment, infrastructure and income that result from successful mining ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very pertinent issue associated with the successful Mount Todd agreement is the topic of representation of the traditional owners of land in negotiation with mining companies. At present, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act requires negotiation to be conducted through the appropriate land council. In recent times, a number of traditional owners have queried the activities of the land councils in representing their interests. While I do not want to pursue it at this time by detailing their claims, I note the difficulty of effective negotiation occurring when there is disagreement of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is heartening to see the progress made by the mining committee of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in achieving mutual understanding of the position of miners and Aborigines on mining matters. As a result, a new committee&mdash;the Joint Council on Aboriginal Land and Mining&mdash;is to be established. A further significant development in this regard has been the decision by Aboriginal groups to join the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines. The Jawoyn Association joined the chamber last year and, recently, Yirrkala Business Enterprises and the Gagadju Contracting Company became members. I look forward to further developments such as these in finding the common ground for Aborigines, miners and the community to benefit from mining on Aboriginal land. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976</EMPHASIS> provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in Schedule 1 to the Act may be granted to Aboriginal Land Trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the Act came into operation in 1977 a total of 58 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment arises from a settlement agreement reached between the Northern Territory Government, the claimants to the Hodgson Downs Land Claim (No. 139) and the Northern Land Council. This agreement includes a clause in which the Northern Territory Government agrees to request the Commonwealth to effect the grant of an estate in fee simple in the land which was the subject of the Land Claim.</PARA>

I do, however, note the comments he made in this debate on successful negotiations between Aboriginal communities and mining companies, although I doubt very strongly that, had we not put the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 into place, we would still be a very long way off having any sort of effective recognition of the rights of Aboriginal people. We certainly would not have had it from the opposition members in this parliament. </PARA>

But there is no legislation of which I would feel more proud to have been associated with and to vote for than the native title legislation that this House endorsed, and which was passed, after much recrimination, in the Senate towards the end of 1993. I believe history will indicate that what the government did on that occasion was very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently we have seen the passing of the second part of our commitment to justice for Aboriginal people&mdash;the land fund bill. The social justice measures we are now considering, which are pertinent to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recognition, Rights &amp; Reform</EMPHASIS> report, are also part of our continuing commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister received that report from Ms O'Donoghue on Monday of this week, he said that what pleased him most about receiving the report was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the fact that we are seeing the public manifestation of the esteem that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people hold for themselves, have always held for themselves, but which in other times when that sense of justice and sense of decency in the country has not focussed on their concerns such a report like this would never have appeared.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, referring to the Native Title Bill and the land fund bill, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a great victory for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and for social democracy in this country when the High Court held its validity&mdash;seven judges to nothing&mdash;a couple of weeks ago. And then on its heels, of course, we bailed up the opposition with their manipulative approach in the Senate to try to destroy the integrity of the Land Fund Bill and despite the Leader of the Opposition's cockiness when faced with the prospect of an early poll&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">he caved in and passed it. So, we got the double of the century in a week. Seven to zero on native title and the Land Fund Bill.</PARA>

The Prime Minister further commented in his speech that there have been many people advising him to get back to the mainstream issues, the real game of interest rates and the economy, as if we had left them. We are not like President Ford. We can walk and chew gum and do a few other things all at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Prime Minister has committed himself to the issues of great concern to not only Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country but also the whole community, and which affect our international reputation on these issues, at the same time he has presided over a government&mdash;as it was shown earlier in the MPI debate&mdash;that has produced 560,000 new jobs in less than two years. This government has produced the best productivity this country has had for a long time, and the lowest inflation and interest rates compared with the previous Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to make this point to the wider community. It is absolutely vital that the Australian people understand the importance of social justice for Aboriginal people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there may be many differing comments that one hears in the electorates and various communities around the country&mdash;criticisms of what we as a government have done on Aboriginal land rights&mdash;there is a prevailing sense of justice and fair play in the Australian psyche which acknowledges the importance of these measures if we are to go forward as a nation and if we are not to deny our past, the injustices of the past and the injustices of the present day. This legislation is part of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now take the House back a little to 1988. It is always helpful to see how far we have come in terms of where we were at the time. In an earlier speech on the land fund bill, I mentioned the issue of the motion that was aimed to be presented to the opening of the new parliament. Honourable members may well recall that we were unable to get bipartisan support because the church leaders had actually suggested a form of words that would relate to the issue of social justice for Aboriginal people. The resolution, after much consultation with the opposition at the time, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the House of Representatives/Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. acknowledge that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Australia was occupied by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who had settled for thousands of years before British settlement at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders suffered dispossession and dispersal upon acquisition of their traditional lands by the British Crown; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders were denied full citizenship rights of the Commonwealth of Australia prior to the 1967 referendum; and</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. considers it to be desirable that the Commonwealth further promote reconciliation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens providing recognition of their special place in the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Although this motion had already been modified to accommodate opposition concerns&mdash;that is, references to legal recognition of land rights and to the desirability of a compact were dropped&mdash;the joint party meeting of the opposition on the morning of the debate endorsed supporting the motion only if the entitlement of self-determination already qualified by the words `subject to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth' were further qualified by the words `in common with all other Australians'. Father Frank Brennan said in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Self-determination for Aborigines&mdash;limits and powers</EMPHASIS> of November 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At best, the proposed amendment was ambiguous suggesting that the entitlement to self-determination was universal but exercisable discretely by separate groups. At worst, it was ruthlessly assimilationist suggesting that self-determination could be exercised only collectively by all Australians. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment was not accepted and the opposition did not support the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, time and time again in debates in this House we have heard much of the same from members of the opposition on all the great social issues regarding justice for Aboriginal people. They have had to be dragged&mdash;to coin a phrase&mdash;kicking and screaming towards the issue. That is a great shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to another moment in 1988 when, at the Barunga festival in the Northern Territory, the Barunga statement was read and some of its items adopted by the then Prime Minister. I have made no secret of the fact that one of the legacies of the previous administration was that we did not fulfil our commitments to Aboriginal people. But the position in that statement is telling because of the things we have resolved and the position we are at now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing it does is exemplify the fact that Aboriginal people, because they have occupied this land for thousands of years more than our miserable 200, have never lost sight of their claim of ownership to the land, their cultural and spiritual identification with the land and their resolution to maintain that in spite of all that has been inflicted upon them. I feel the Barunga statement is worth reminding ourselves of. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We, the indigenous owners and occupiers of Australia, call on the Australian Government and people to recognise our rights:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To self-determination and self-management, including the freedom to pursue our own economic, social, religious and cultural development;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To permanent control and enjoyment of our ancestral lands;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To compensation for the loss of use of our lands, there having been no extinction of original title;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To protection of and control of access to our sacred sites, sacred objects, artefacts, designs, knowledge and works of art;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To respect for and promotion of our Aboriginal identity, including the cultural, linguistic, religious and historical aspects, and including the right to be educated in our own languages and in our own culture and history.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement then goes on to point out the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various international covenants. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call on the Commonwealth to pass laws providing:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A national elected Aboriginal and Islander organisation to oversee Aboriginal and Islander affairs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A national system of land rights;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A police and justice system which recognises our customary laws and frees us from discrimination and any activity which may threaten our identity or security, interfere with our freedom of expression or association, or otherwise prevent our full enjoyment and exercise of universally-recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA>We have not achieved all of that; there is no doubt about that. But it is helpful to know that this government, particularly under the leadership of the Prime Minister, has been determined to deal with the issues raised in the Barunga statement. I will now read from the up-to-date report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recognition Rights &amp; Reform</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report is about recognition, rights and reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is about recognition of the unique place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australian history and society today. It is about the rights of Australia's indigenous peoples. It is about the further reforms necessary to secure and underpin those rights and to ensure they can be exercised and enjoyed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our focus is on institutional, structural, collaborative, cooperative reform. It is about a fundamental shift from welfare to basic rights, from dependence to autonomy, from government assistance to power. Central to the social justice agenda is self determination.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have never wavered from where they knew their rights should be, in spite of all that dispossession has inflicted upon them. We now have a considerable responsibility to put in place those institutional arrangements which, in spite of all our efforts, have never been met by state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fact was picked up by the Northern Territory Central Land Council back in 1991 when ATSIC was being developed in response to the Barunga statement. The Central Land Council report on the infrastructure provision in remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, August 1991, on pages 116 to 117, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the success of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act making it possible for Aboriginal people to regain control of their traditional lands, NT Government opposition to land claims and the existence of guidelines which prevent the delivery of services to small remote communities, limit the extent to which access to land can achieve meaningful improvements in the living standards of remote Aboriginal people . . . if health conditions, in particular, show no improvement because of poor water supplies, for example, then the ability of the community to take control of its own affairs will be seriously weakened.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's focus now will be to try to right the wrongs, having given rights and access to land through the High Court Mabo decision on native title and the land fund bill in spite of opposition from those opposite and a lack of leadership from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition leader has shown a disastrous inability to come to terms with a position of moral integrity on Aboriginal land rights. We saw an example of that most recently in the Hindmarsh Island debacle. He sat on his hands knowing full well that his then shadow minister for the environment, the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), had perpetrated many wrongs in his misuse and misappropriation of those documents. The opposition leader came into this House with the current opposition spokesperson on Aboriginal affairs, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), and sat on his hands and did nothing. He did not show any leadership. He did not sack his frontbench person. Finally, when public furore forced the resignation of the opposition spokesperson for the environment, the Leader of the Opposition said he was an honourable man. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello) has said, `We must have him back in the shadow ministry because we cannot afford to lose his talent and ability.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this is the sort of moral integrity that we always get from the Liberal-National Party coalition in spite of the several good people on the opposition benches&mdash;usually on the back benches&mdash;who have the best interests of Aboriginal people at heart. There is only one government that will work with the Aboriginal people to get to the future: a Labor government. The Aboriginal people know it and the media know it. On any assessment of the debate, we have always given moral leadership and effective legislative leadership. This amendment is further evidence of that. We will not leave Aboriginal people behind. We will make sure that they get their justice, infrastructure and enough support to make land rights work for them in the Northern Territory and elsewhere. </PARA>

Various members of my family are still spread in that fine state. I have a continuing and abiding interest in that part of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As some preliminary comments, I would like to try to put a regional Australian's point of view on Aboriginal matters. We must be very careful that we do not get caught up too much in our own rhetoric. We must be very honourable in the way that we conduct our affairs regarding the original inhabitants of this fine country of ours, because I have a feeling that too many times in the parliament Aboriginal people have been exploited for political purposes. At a time in our history when we must aim for a cooperative and integrated society based on non-racial grounds, we must be very careful that we bring the whole country with us in any reforms or any changes that we make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking as a regional Australian, I would like to remind the House that Aboriginal people inhabited every square kilometre of this land. Yet, in the native title issue, we find that it is only ever regional Australia that gets caught up in the practical detail. We do know that only five per cent of Aboriginal people&mdash;if, indeed, five per cent are fortunate enough&mdash;will have an opportunity to access land through the native title legislation. We also need to look at the white people who live in regional Australia because, there again, we have a minority group. There are perhaps 10 per cent or five per cent of white people living in regional Australia who will be in any way affected by the issues of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Northern Territory, we know that 40 per cent of the land mass&mdash;like the 30 per cent of my own electorate, which effectively is 30 per cent of South Australia&mdash;is controlled by Aboriginal people. Any decisions made by high courts or parliaments of Australia&mdash;and, indeed, any judgments that are made by the majority of our people&mdash;impact disproportionately on regional Australia. I do not think that that fact is acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate enough this morning to spend a bit of time with Justice French, a name familiar to many of us now and certainly to all of us in this House. When asked in a perfectly friendly and cordial meeting how many native title claims had been put forward, he said he thought that about 60 had been put forward and 35 had been accepted by the tribunal, but none had been finalised&mdash;that is, none had finally come to fruition and been accepted as native title leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the grand vision that sometimes plays a little too much on the lounge rooms of our capital cities and a little too often on the urban comfort zone, and which a little too often exploits Aboriginal people, is a process which almost totally ignores regional Australia and most of its inhabitants. As someone who has lived in regional Australia all his life, I feel very acutely that it is too easy for white Australia simply to pass Aboriginal issues back to regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the opportunity to put those preliminary comments on the record. If we are going to genuinely live together in this country in harmony and on a non-racial basis, where we are all accepted as equal, we must acknowledge that regional Australia is carrying a disproportionate share of the burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to add another parcel of land to the Northern Land Council at the request of the Northern Territory government. It is a considerable piece of land and is already owned by the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act 1991, the Pitjantjatjara lands that I mentioned earlier were returned to the Aboriginal people during the Fraser government years, at the initiative of the state Tonkin Liberal government. The Pitjantjatjara lands, as I indicated earlier, cover about 15 per cent of South Australia, from the Western Australian and Northern Territory border down to Marla at the top of the Maralinga lands, taking in numerous distinct communities, including Pukutja, Umuwa, Mimili and Fregon. The Maralinga Tjarutja takes in a similar amount of country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been my pleasure to visit these lands on many occasions and it has proved a very interesting and educational experience. I am proud to be well acquainted with many Aboriginal people living and working in these areas. One of my particular interests concerns those people struggling to make a living from the land there. The land is harsh and dry but can sustain significant pastoral pursuits and other industries. There are many teachers, health workers and other professionals based in these lands. I have enormous respect for their dedication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disturbing aspect of the Pitjantjatjara lands is that the Aboriginal communities living there continue to live in what are considered Third World conditions. Basic health care and cleanliness are still major problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I mentioned that regional Australia is carrying a disproportionate share of the burden. In my work with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I visited a significant regional community in Western Australia. I would like to counsel a note of caution before we get into Commonwealth-state divides and too much political acrimony is engendered in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee, when visiting the west, went to a local government area, or shire, as it is known there, which has about a 50 per cent Aboriginal population base. About 90 per cent of the intake of the district hospital is Aboriginal. There is a 50 per cent Aboriginal population base but a 90 per cent Aboriginal involvement as clients in the hospital. A whole range of issues flows from that, but the main point I would like to make now is that the state is at the front line of providing that service. It is no good&mdash;no good at all&mdash;for the Commonwealth to engage in constant carping criticism of the states when the states are expected to pick up a disproportionate share of the burden. We need to look at the task, break down the boundaries&mdash;whether Commonwealth, state, local or Aboriginal&mdash;and see how we can best cooperate. The whole debate has a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that the federal government believes that returning land to Aboriginal communities will somehow solve their problems, we can see from the example of the Pitjantjatjara experience that land alone is not a solution. The Maralinga Tjarutja lands provide their own unique story because of the British nuclear testing that took place there in the 1950s and 1960s. I visited Maralinga last month with the parliamentary Public Works committee to assess the first stages of the clean-out process. That is in 1990s terms. Of course, there have been significant clean-up operations since the tests of the 1950s and 1960s. This is, hopefully, the finalisation of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British government has acknowledged that it has a responsibility for the effects its testing had on the area. It has made an ex gratia payment in recent times, and that agreement is to be welcomed, but the effects which the testing had on the Aboriginal communities of that region can never be fully redressed. We can only look to the future and help the traditional communities take control of that land again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pitjantjatjara and Maralinga lands in Grey are not dissimilar to the lands of the Northern Territory in administration and in scale. Both these large parcels of land are owned by Aboriginal people. Unfortunately they have not always had a happy past but, hopefully, they will have a much happier future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My underlying concern with Aboriginal lands is that the communities that live there must be given every fair opportunity to develop the land and to genuinely take control of their own lives. There are, no doubt, hundreds of reasons why this has not taken place to any significant degree in the Pitjantjatjara lands and the Maralinga Tjarutja lands. Some of these go right back to the root problems of European habitation of our country, urban paternalism and, as I have mentioned already, the inability of the Commonwealth and the states to focus sufficiently well on the issue. Sadly, too often, there is also too much political exploitation of the Aboriginal issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the Pitjantjatjara lands. There are fundamental differences between what the Aboriginal community wants and what the government bureaucracy delivers. Many homes were built on the lands. However, a lot of the homes that I have seen have been destroyed or vandalised or are uninhabited. While there have been numerous calls for greater spending on Aboriginal housing, we must first ask ourselves why past housing in areas such as the Pitjantjatjara lands was destroyed or was inappropriate. Some good work has been done but we must apply the research in a very practical way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to people on the housing issue, I know that the housing provided was not exactly what the Aboriginal people wanted. There is still plenty of room for much improved communication in planning those homes. I offer this example. Many traditional Aboriginal people like to sleep outdoors. When some of the homes were built, families found they preferred to sleep on the front porch. However, the front porch, if there was one, was not always located on the right side of the house. For example, it may have faced the hot sun. This is one example of homes not being suitable for the Aboriginal way of living. It needs to be reinforced time and time again that practical solutions do exist and that it is for all of us, to the best of our ability, to make sure that we apply those practical solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely important that, before the government goes gung-ho into handing out funding, Aboriginal communities are consulted from the outset and asked exactly what they want. I believe the failure to do this is one of the reasons we have seen very little improvement in certain areas from the millions the government has spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those who will say that the situation in some areas has grown worse over the years. I am insufficiently knowledgeable to be able to judge because I have been in this office for only two years and it would be too arrogant of me to make a judgment as to whether it is better or worse. I know that there is much to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of Aboriginal deaths in custody is well documented, and that in itself has been investigated. Being a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs gives me a better understanding from my perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While governments are willing to provide funding, they are not always willing to go that one step further to ensure the best management support. A number of people in my electorate have raised the subject of Aboriginal funding, including members of the Aboriginal community. They are the people that I am most keen to listen to. There is a deep concern that certain people are keeping tight control over funds, and from time to time there is rorting. The more important part about some of the side issues&mdash;we have to keep focusing on the core issue; that is, improving the lot and making sure that we spend our money well&mdash;is that we recognise that in a country as wealthy as ours funding will always be limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As people working and living in the lands say to me, `We cannot waste money, scarce resources, we have to target them in the most appropriate way.' I will not dwell on the recent issue of ATSIC and the Ombudsman, but we should not be too frightened to make sure that accountability is in our mind, particularly in the commercial operations&mdash;and I think this is improving over the years&mdash;and we should apply strong accountability in the expenditure of the financial resources available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, while this bill proposes a non-contentious amendment, because all relevant parties are in agreement that the parcel of land near Katherine should be granted to the traditional owners, this is an opportunity to reflect on the issue of land and its relevance to improving other aspects of the Aboriginal community's lives. It is obvious that we still have a long way to go. It is important that the federal government&mdash;and I speak most sincerely from a regional Australian's perspective and as someone that I hope has a practical application in life&mdash;does not dwell too long on the grand statement. It is important that we do not dwell too long on the political rhetoric but that we get down to it and look at the issues in a practical way; that we do not exploit these Aboriginal people for political purposes but genuinely work in partnership with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the wit and the capacity in this nation to do that. We will be judged in the generations ahead for the way that we have been able to cooperate, the bipartisan way in which we have been able to address the issue, and the way that we have been able to acknowledge that those of us who live in regional Australia, and I keep coming back to that, do bear the very significant&mdash;I will not say `burden', because for me it is a privilege to know the Aboriginal people&mdash;practical consequences of the management of many of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to recognise that there is a willingness in the community to apply in a practical way solutions, support and a genuine recognition of the fair go, and I am sure that if we do apply ourselves appropriately we will make progress. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I address my remarks to the question of Hodgson Downs because it is important that we understand the significance of this particular block of land for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory which, of course, is in my electorate. The first thing that should be said is that Hodgson Downs is an extremely important ritual centre for the whole of the Roper River area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dreamings that pass through the property make it very important for the whole of the Northern Territory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, a number of the people who were very well known as ritual leaders, both women and men, have died between the preparation of the claim and the negotiations which settled it. Unfortunately, that seems often to be the case. There are and there have been claims outstanding in the Northern Territory for over a decade primarily&mdash;not in this case, but in most cases&mdash;as a result of the resistance of the Northern Territory government to the rights of Aboriginal people under the land rights act. </PARA>

That is sad and an indictment on the CLP government of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance some of the people who died were members of the Roberts and Farrell families. Sir Philip Roberts and Silas Roberts are two of the well-known people associated with the lease who have passed on. Both of these men were very significant individuals in the Northern Territory, whether in the context of Aboriginal society or non-Aboriginal society. Both men are immensely important in their own right with standing across the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular instance, the Northern Territory government cooperated in the settlement of the claim. I am not exactly sure of the number of times that the Northern Territory government has taken challenges to land claims either to the Federal Court or the full bench of the High Court, but it is in excess of 30 and it has not won very many&mdash;less than five. It is an important precedent that the CLP in this instance has cooperated with the settlement of the claim. I acknowledge that approach by it. But I would not get too carried away with it, and I will explain why in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hodgson Downs was purchased as a pastoral lease and then claimed by Aboriginal claimants. As a result of the claim process it became Aboriginal land under the land rights act, thus our amendment this afternoon. What is significant is that Hodgson Downs has not operated as a pastoral lease since the 1960s. That in itself is important, and I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why it is important is that there can be no argument by opponents to land rights, some very conservative vested interests in small sections of the pastoral industry. That the granting of this lease will have a negative effect on the Northern Territory cattle industry is clearly, patently, untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great importance of this amendment today is that the strength of the spiritual attachment to the land has been recognised and respected in the legislation. That respect was incorporated in the legislation, which significantly was prepared initially by the Whitlam government and subsequently, although amended by the Fraser government, put into force by a conservative coalition government in this country. The Fraser government needs to be congratulated for having the foresight to carry on the work of the Whitlam government to pass this piece of legislation, which was based on recommendations of Justice Woodward in his royal commission report. For those on the opposition benches who have reservations about the importance of Aboriginal land and how it should be dealt with, I commend to them their reading of that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have already alluded to the attitude of the CLP government in the Northern Territory to the land rights act and to the practice of Aboriginal people purchasing pastoral leases and, in some cases, seeking to convert them to inalienable freehold title under the land rights act. I think we as a nation need to be concerned that, despite the very many good words I have heard this afternoon from opposition members in this place, there are conservative political leaders in this country who do not share the views expressed by the opposition and who have sought to disparage in the most insulting way the efforts of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory to acquire land and then transfer its title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A disingenuous concern has been expressed by the Northern Territory government about the ability and desire of Aboriginal people to purchase pastoral leases. Indeed, in his address to the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association, which was put out in a press release on 6 May 1994 in the lead-up to the Northern Territory election, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Depending how you are situated, there seems to be good times and bad times for the cattle industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Note this particular point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[I]f you're in Central Australia and you haven't recovered from the drought, or are surrounded by properties that have been taken over by Aboriginal interests, it's hard to find a silver lining.</PARA>
<PARA>He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now for more bad news. We've heard on the grapevine of a push for Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account reserves of around twenty million dollars to be used to buy up pastoral properties [for Aboriginal people].</PARA>
<PARA>I, as a non-Aboriginal Australian, as a Northern Territory citizen, as a citizen of this country, am concerned at those sorts of views being expressed by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. When discussing the issue of social justice in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on Tuesday, 10 May 1994, and when referring to issues relating to the provision of services to meet the disadvantage of Aboriginal people in this country, the Chief Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it social justice that provides benefits to some based on racial ancestry which others pay for but are not entitled to?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the attitude of the Northern Territory Chief Minister&mdash;an attitude which, frankly, I regard as racist; an attitude which is replicated in his statements time and again about the issue of land rights. That attitude is not shared by some of our opponents here. I was delighted this afternoon to hear the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), when referring to this land rights legislation, which was passed after development by the Whitlam and Fraser governments&mdash;and they deserve due credit for it&mdash;say that the Liberal Party is proud and justifiably so of it. His pride, his satisfaction, his endorsement&mdash;and I hope the endorsement of the shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus)&mdash;are not shared by the CLP or by Marshall Perron. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read what the Northern Territory Chief Minister said about the land rights act. I ask the shadow minister to take note of this. Mr Perron said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should not be one law for one group of people and a completely different one for others.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that his government would be `vigorously pursuing' the right of territorians to be equal with the rest of Australia when it came to land rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory government has made it very clear that it does not support the key aspect of this legislation, which is the right of Aboriginal people to withhold consent for development on their land. That is the key aspect or centrepiece in terms of Aboriginal control. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 10 May 1994 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Mr Perron, yesterday challenged the validity of sections of the federal Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act and in particular Aborigines' right of veto over land.</PARA>
<PARA>What Mr Perron does not know and what he ought to know is that there is no mention of the word `veto' in the act in any event. His views are shared by others in the Northern Territory government. The erstwhile pretender to Perron's throne as chief minister is Shane Stone. He said in the legislative assembly of October last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that if Canberra was to get their hoof off our throat and get rid of absurd policies like the 3 mine policy, and the Northern Territory land right act, with Mabo legislation across the top, we could get on with the business of making a dollar . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the shadow minister, who is sitting in the chamber, whether she supports these views or whether she will step away from them. Will she walk out of this chamber and say that she supports the views of the Northern Territory Chief Minister, or the views of the erstwhile chief minister Shane Stone, or the views of other members of the CLP government in relation to the land rights act? Or will she support the member for Aston, who proudly speaks of his endorsement of this particular bill? I am waiting with bated breath, and I doubt that I will ever know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know of the association that the CLP in the Northern Territory has with this opposition. I ask the shadow minister to ask her colleague Senator Grant Tambling&mdash;Grant Rumblings&mdash;what he thinks of this legislation. Does he support your view, if you have this view?

But they will not tell the Northern Territory CLP what their position is. They will not tell the CLP that they will not tolerate the stunts being pulled by them in the Northern Territory. As I think the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) said this afternoon in this chamber, the opposition will support the right of people to withhold consent over mining on their land. The Northern Territory government needs to be told this to see whether it will espouse the same principles, to see whether the Northern Territory Chief Minister will retract his previous statements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comment has been made in this debate in this past week about reports, particularly about Mick Dodson's second report as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. He makes particular reference to the issue of land acquisition. I think it is important that we understand this in the context of this debate because this was about the purchase of a property which was ultimately transferred into Aboriginal title as a result of a land claim process. Mr Dodson states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal land acquisition programmes, for instance, are constantly being criticised&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we know they are, by the Northern Territory CLP government, as I have already illustrated, and by sections of industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for not being primarily directed towards maximising monetary profit . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is Shane Stone's line. Mr Dodson continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such criticisms indicate a failure to understand or respect the fact that Indigenous peoples may place just as great a value on their social and cultural wellbeing as they do on economic gain. What is at issue here is the practical application of the right to self-determination and, specifically, the non-Indigenous system's willingness to surrender control of the way in which Indigenous peoples manage and develop their resources.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to make a comment on the assessment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's land acquisition package. I quote from that assessment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was very high satisfaction with the movement of kin to remote properties, considerable satisfaction with the levels of harmony achieved, and on cultural matters, high satisfaction with the establishment of outstations, the protection of significant areas of land and with culturally appropriate schooling.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very important. I just want to quote from the report of Pat Dodson from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of general principles can be derived as to what rights Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would wish to see recognised, in the legal framework, so that there is appropriate empowerment to ensure that these rights can actually be accessed by indigenous communities and organisations. These principles might be set out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the right to own and control their cultural and intellectual property&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a fundamental right and one which we should all endorse&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the right to protect sacred and significant sites;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the right to own and control management of lands which are conserved in whole or in part because of their indigenous cultural values;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the right to benefit from the commercial exploitation of indigenous flora and fauna;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the right to camp and hunt or gather for personal or family use in conserved land and marine areas; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the right to participate in the commercial harvesting of native resources of the land and sea where previously the granting of rights, licenses or quotas have had the effect of excluding indigenous individuals or communities.</PARA>
<PARA>That range of issues is in part directly addressed by the Northern Territory land rights legislation&mdash;a very important piece of legislation. I would think it is one of the key pieces of social legislation passed in the history of this parliament and passed on a bipartisan basis. It was initially developed by the Whitlam government and finally passed by the Fraser government, based on the reports of the Woodward commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something which is being supported in this chamber by the opposition. It is something which, most significantly for the people in the Northern Territory, for those people who are subject to this legislation, is not supported by the conservative Country-Liberal Party government in the Northern Territory. That should concern all Australians. If we are to strive towards reconciliation, if we are to accept difference and diversity, if we are to accept the importance and significance of Aboriginal cultural and heritage values and if we are to accept and take pride in the spirituality of Aboriginal heritage, what we should be saying to the Northern Territory government is: `Get your act together. You're an international embarrassment. You're a shame on Australia for not supporting this very key piece of social legislation,' which, as Pat Dodson has said, gives people a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is something which I know is supported in the good hearts of many of our opponents in this chamber, but something which is significantly not supported by the government with the primary interface in terms of the provision of services for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to say some relatively brief words in summing up the debate that has ensued in respect of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) before the House. I note that the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) made a very important contribution highlighting the policies of the Northern Territory government as they relate to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say for the record that my recollection is there are some 30 Federal Court or High Court challenges that have been launched in respect of intended grants or in respect of land claims hearings under the Northern Territory land rights act by the Northern Territory government. Of those 30 legal actions, my recollection is that, at best, only one-half of one of those cases has, in fact, been successful. What we have seen is tens of millions of dollars of public money over a very long time used to thwart the finalisation of land claims. Regrettably, that process of frustration has led to the death of a great many traditional owners who have not been able to see the ultimate return of their traditional country. To those of us in the parliament who have been privileged to be either directly involved, as ministers or as observers, in the return of traditional land under the Northern Territory land rights act, it is a deeply moving experience. I do not think I have been to one single land title return where the traditional owners have not wept with a mixture of joy and sadness on that occasion. Often, the sadness is because of those who are no longer with them to witness that great occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, it is important to put on record that this is a very positive piece of legislation and a very positive development that we see the land council, the Northern Territory government and, indeed, the Commonwealth parliament unanimously coming together to settle and resolve one of the outstanding land claims. This is how we, as a nation and as governments, should transact business and regulate our dealings with indigenous people. If we can settle claims, if we can negotiate a successful outcome, it is a far better approach than litigating at great cost to the whole community, including the non-Aboriginal community, and at great personal cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I have been very pleased to be deeply involved in during my time as a minister is trying to address the backlog of land claims under the Northern Territory land rights act; that is, those claims where there has been a land commissioner's report but no decision has been taken in respect of a return of the country. It happened through various reasons&mdash;I do not think it was the fault of any minister&mdash;that some of the land claims had been effectively outstanding for the best part of a decade or more. We now have a position where we are virtually up to date with all the land commissioners' reports. With minor exceptions, they have now been acted on, proper decisions taken and the land returned. That is how the land rights act should work for indigenous people and for the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) made an important contribution on behalf of the coalition. What he said, in response to a comment I made in the course of his speech, was that the coalition was committed to the retention of the veto under the Northern Territory land rights act. That, of course, was the very issue which led the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) into the troubled sands of the central Australian deserts in the course of last year. It was the issue of whether there was going to be a repeal of that veto provision or not that regrettably caused him and the wider community so much confusion. Today, we have an important statement from the shadow minister for resources and energy, the member for Gippsland, committing the coalition to the retention of that veto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for the Northern Territory is right to raise the issue of the stance of the Northern Territory government. I do not know whether the shadow minister's comments will be reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> in the morning or whether they will be in Saturday morning's paper that greets the Chief Minister with this news. But I would hope that the comments by the shadow minister for resources and energy would, for all time, end the threat that has been hanging over the heads of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory that their rights would in some way be eroded if, in the distant future, if ever, a coalition government came to power. So at least in that respect I think this debate has been important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has also been characterised by a large measure of cross-party cooperation. We should not be ashamed about that. As parliamentarians, and often protagonists, we should not be worried that on this occasion&mdash;shock, horror&mdash;political parties and members of parliament agree. We are agreeing about some important principles. The return of land to its traditional owners is a very important measure of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to find far greater areas of common agreement. There is very much a need for a return to the greatest degree of cross-party cooperation in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs that we can possibly achieve. I do not think that Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders want to see a bitter divide in this parliament on indigenous policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that during the first three years I was in this job the then shadow minister, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), played a very constructive role in the coalition&mdash;and I give him credit for that&mdash;in achieving a large measure of cross-party cooperation. It worked well for him as the shadow minister and it worked well for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Regrettably, after the 1993 election, the coalition took a very big step away from that cross-party cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to recanvass what has sometimes been described as the Mabo debate, which was a pretty sad and sorry time in Australian political history. The Mabo debate concluded in the most dramatic way by a 7:0 decision by the High Court of Australia in upholding the validity of the Native Title Act. We now see a genuine sea change in the attitudes of not only key people in the community but also very significant sections of the Australian mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change was reflected in the statement by Mr Leon Davis, the managing director of CRA. When he recognised the significance of the Native Title Act, he indicated that his company could work with that legislation and, of even more significance, he indicated a commitment to negotiate with Aboriginal people. Again the shadow minister for resources highlighted the importance of that negotiation. He spoke of the agreement that had been achieved in respect of the Mount Todd goldmine in the Northern Territory, where the NT government negotiated with Aboriginal people and with the company in question, Zapopan, with the support of the Commonwealth. We had an outcome there that gave the title of that land to Aboriginal people and got the goldmine off the ground, but very importantly it gave Aboriginal people an economic interest in the region and in the development of the mine proposal. This need to move to equal negotiations with and mutual respect of Aboriginal people in the mining industry is one of the most important agendas for corporate Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until Mr Davis made that statement, CRA, to be very frank, did not have a recognised good public track record in dealing with indigenous people. It is sad, but I think it is true to say that. I am so full of hope that Mr Davis's statement will be further reflected in the range of initiatives and policies taken by CRA that will make that company a pacesetter in the Australian mining industry in its dealings with indigenous people. I think the statement is a bona fide one and one that comes with considerable commitment from the chief executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a couple of other things before I finish up. There have been some very significant developments elsewhere in trying to achieve a greater degree of cross-party cooperation. In this parliament today we had formed a group called `Parliamentarians for reconciliation'. Its conveners are Senator Reynolds from Queensland and the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a former shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I hope that that group can play a constructive role in the parliament in building cross-party cooperation. That does not mean that issues of principle are not going to be defended, fought for and upheld. I think, if we do have rational debates about issues of policy, it is possible to get that very large measure of cross-party cooperation. It gives me no joy whatsoever to have issues of Aboriginal affairs policy the subject of bitter division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House for its generosity in allowing me to explore a number of related issues mostly raised in the course of debate. Another important area where we need to work with great wisdom as parliamentarians and to approach in the most constructive and open-hearted manner possible is the important issue of social policy, the third stage of the response to the High Court decision in the form of the social justice package. There has already been a report from ATSIC advocating proposals; there will be a report from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner; and there is a report by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to the House and to all those who might be listening to this parliamentary broadcast the significance of that document. It is a unanimous document supported by Democrat, coalition and government members on the council and a wide array of Australians&mdash;Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal&mdash;that really sets out a potential agenda for constructive and sensible social reform in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we can get behind the broad thrust of that document&mdash;by all means let us have a discussion about particular issues that some of us might not support at a particular point in time&mdash;if we are open-hearted in the way we approach it and if we show respect to the processes of further consultation and negotiation and strive for the greatest degree of cross-party cooperation, we will be doing the same service to the nation as a parliament that we did in initiating unanimously the reconciliation process itself. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this Bill now be read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1994 will assist the government in ensuring that Australia is fulfilling its treaty obligations and its citizens do not contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in any part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Controlling weapons of mass destruction is one of the most important security challenges facing the post-Cold War world. The issue is a high foreign policy and defence priority for the government. International recognition of the horrific results of the use of weapons of mass destruction&mdash;nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and their missile delivery systems&mdash;and concerns over the destabilising impact of the proliferation of such weapons have resulted in several major achievements in addressing this problem. Of greatest importance are the multilateral treaties either banning or restricting the proliferation of such weapons, principally the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the biological weapons convention and the chemical weapons convention, which is not yet in force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these global treaties, and reinforcing their objectives, are other measures which have been taken to stem proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, WMD. In concert with other similarly minded countries, the Australian government has maintained a range of export controls aimed at preventing the transfer, directly or indirectly, of goods and technology, which could be used in the development of WMD, to programs known to be or suspected of posing a WMD proliferation risk. These controls were developed by international export control regimes of which Australia is a member&mdash;the nuclear suppliers group and the Zangger committee (nuclear), the Australia group (chemical and biological) and the missile technology control regime (missile delivery systems). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's export controls on goods, including technology in a tangible form, are covered by the Customs Act 1901 through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Exports of dual use materials and technology, equipment and technology which have both commercial and military uses, are controlled under a series of these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to identify and describe, for regulatory purposes, all items that might be used in a WMD program. Some items may be identified but, because of their widespread commercial application, it would be impracticable to control them under the customs regulations: once in regulations, all exports of these items would require a permit, which would create an unnecessary administrative burden on the licensing authority as well as for industry. However, the government would still want to have the authority to stop such items from being exported to a destination considered to be a WMD proliferation risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The customs regulations also cannot control the supply of goods and technology by an Australian overseas or the provision of services or other assistance to a WMD program. Services or assistance could for example take the form of a consultancy contract to provide technical, operational or management advice to a WMD program; financial assistance; brokering the supply of materials; or specialised training. It would also cover the transmission of information by telephone, fax and other forms which cannot be covered under the customs regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of similarly placed countries have responded to this problem by the development of the catch-all or safety net provisions as an element of the barriers to WMD proliferation, for example, the United States and Germany. Although it can take different forms, essentially it works in two ways. It puts an onus on a person not to export goods or provide a service or other assistance intentionally or recklessly to a WMD program. It also provides the government with a mechanism to prevent the export of goods or the provision of a service or other assistance to an actual or possible WMD program. While there is a wide range of goods and services that can be used in a WMD program which have legitimate commercial uses and are not specifically controlled under existing legislation, it would be inconsistent with Australia's strong support for the international non-proliferation regimes and strong opposition to WMD proliferation for the government not to have all necessary authority to prevent the provision of goods and services to WMD programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a theoretical problem for Australia. There have been several cases in recent years where Australian companies have inadvertently become involved in activities which could have assisted WMD programs, and these activities were not specifically covered by Australia's existing non-proliferation legislation. Fortunately the companies involved were cooperative and ceased the activities in question when the government informed them of its concerns. We cannot, however, conclude from the positive outcome in those cases that this will always be the case in the future, particularly in the face of the possible financial inducements on offer from those associated with the WMD programs; hence the need to provide clear legislative backing for the government's comprehensive WMD non-proliferation policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prohibitions under the bill would apply where the person involved knows of or suspects the connection with a WMD program. The bill provides for a ministerial certificate to be issued prohibiting relevant activities in cases where government authorities are aware of the risk of the potential contribution to a WMD program, but the exporter is not aware of the connection or has ignored or not appreciated warning signs. An important element of the bill is the provision for a mechanism to be established for companies and individuals to obtain written guidance from the government on the risk, or not, of a particular planned transaction contributing to a WMD program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not meant to be the prime or sole barrier against possible Australian assistance to the proliferation of WMD. The customs regulations, information programs and persuasion will continue to serve an important function. The legislation would be used only when other measures fail or are unavailable. It would also serve to underline again the government's clear commitment to prevent Australian assistance to proliferation of WMD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is worth reiterating for the benefit of the House part of what the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has just said which goes to the heart of the rationale for the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1994. I quote in part from what the Assistant Treasurer has just said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Controlling weapons of mass destruction is one of the most important security challenges facing the post-Cold War world. The issue is a high foreign policy and defence priority for the government.</PARA>
<PARA>He finished by saying&mdash;and I think this is a point that we need to reinforce:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is not meant to be the prime or sole barrier against possible Australian assistance to the proliferation of WMD. The Customs Regulations, information programs and persuasion will continue to serve an important function. The legislation would be used only when other measures fail or are unavailable. It would also serve to underline again the government's clear commitment to prevent Australian assistance to proliferation of WMD.</PARA>
<PARA>With those comments by way of background, the coalition supports the general thrust of the bill. However, we do have some reservations about the mechanics of one or two clauses of the bill, especially in relation to the bureaucratic demands imposed by it. I will come back to those specific items a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Assistant Treasurer said, the general purpose of the bill is to restrict trade in any materials likely to be used in weapons of mass destruction, the so-called WMDs, which describes nuclear, biological and chemical weapons capable of resulting in mass destruction of the population. The bill does so by levying penalties for export of goods which may be used for the construction of such WMDs, with a couple of strong qualifiers that it only covers exports where a person believes or suspects on reasonable grounds that goods will or may be used in a WMD program, and also that its broad framework allows normal exports and allows for clarification by the minister if doubt exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the basic question that we should all be addressing this evening is: why, therefore, should all Australians support this bill? I suggest that there are five reasons why we should do just that. Firstly, it recognises a general repugnance of any proliferation post-Cold War of such weapons. Secondly, it signals a very specific commitment to the associated international treaties. Thirdly, its strong theme strengthens and reinforces our attitude to an indefinite extension of the non-proliferation treaty at the NPT review and extension conference in New York next month, between 17 April and 12 May. Fourthly, it exemplifies Australia's commitment to regional stability by showing the strength of our own commitment to non-proliferation. Finally, it is very consistent with last year's defence white paper. I take the opportunity to refer to that defence white paper, specifically to pages 108 and 109, under the heading `Non-Proliferation and Arms Control'. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effective controls on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles contribute significantly to Australia's security. Twenty years or more of sustained negotiation between the then superpowers and in multilateral forums have led to the development of an unprecedented array of non-proliferation and arms control regimes (particularly the Strategic Arms Limitations Agreement and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the Treaty Banning Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which I referred to a moment ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions, and the Partial and Threshold Nuclear Test Ban Treaties). However, with the end of the Cold War, economic growth and strategic uncertainties have increased the potential for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As a result, non-proliferation issues are at the forefront of international security concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia shares a global interest in reducing the risk of countries acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. We have a strong direct interest in ensuring that such weapons are not acquired by countries or terrorist groups which could use them against Australia. While the mere acquisition of these weapons would not indicate a threat to Australia, their existence within reach of us would complicate and add to the cost of our defence. Furthermore, if one regional country acquires weapons of mass destruction or missile capabilities other regional countries may respond, possibly by developing matching capabilities. Such a sequence would destabilise regional security and further complicate defence planning. The best way to prevent proliferation is to establish effective global regimes, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention. Australia will continue to support and if possible strengthen these regimes, and ensure they are fully implemented and effectively verifiable. Defence will continue to promote and implement regional non-proliferation and arms control measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key priority is limiting the proliferation of ballistic missiles. The Government will continue its efforts to make the Missile Technology Control Regime an effective mechanism for this purpose, and will seek the broadest international commitment to controls on developing and exporting ballistic missile technology. Our involvement in international processes will be complemented by continued efforts to secure acceptance of, and adherence to, this Regime within the region.</PARA>
<PARA>In this context, it is appropriate that we should review Australia's track record on these issues. I point out, for those who are not aware of it, that we are party to three international treaties concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&mdash;the so-called NPT, which I would like to comment on in a little more detail later&mdash;was ratified by Australia on 23 January 1973, and was substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. We also have the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and their Destruction. This was ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977, and was substantially implemented by the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, which was ratified on 6 May 1994, but has not yet come into force internationally. It will be substantially implemented by the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, which will come into force on a date to be proclaimed or upon the convention coming into force. It is therefore quite unambiguous that these three treaties and their associated legislation place limits on the use and transfer of chemical, nuclear and bacteriological material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, Australia is involved in four relevant international groups which aim to control the international transfer of weapons grade materials. The first of these groups is the Zangger committee, which was formed in the early 1970s by countries which supply nuclear materials and which have developed a list of equipment, the export of which should be subject to safeguards. The overall aim of this group is to develop controls on the export of equipment for use in the production of special fissionable material. The second of these groups is the nuclear suppliers group, which was formed in 1974. This group has developed guidelines for the export of nuclear related equipment and technology which is aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third group is the missile technology control regime, which was referred to in the extract I read into the record from the defence paper of last year. That group was established in 1987. It comprises a group of countries which have agreed to a basic set of guidelines on the export of missile technology, and these guidelines are incorporated into national export regulations. Finally, there is the Australia group, which was established in 1987 to facilitate a chemical weapons treaty. It deals with the export of material for the making of chemical weapons until such a treaty comes into force. It has also developed a list of chemicals which require export controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is therefore pretty clear that Australia's record is very good. We have met our international obligations arising from treaties and international group involvement by enacting important legislation&mdash;as I have just indicated&mdash;to deal with such nuclear chemical and bacteriological material. Export controls have been imposed also through the Customs (Prohibited Export) Regulations under the Customs Act 1901. Clearly, we are playing an important role in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to some of the more significant clauses of the bill, at international law, Australia would not have jurisdiction to legislate in relation to things that happen outside Australia unless it had this connection with Australian citizens, residents or companies. To this end, clause 6 of the bill provides that the bill will apply not only to actual acts or omissions in Australia but also to actual acts or omissions done outside Australia by Australian citizens, people who ordinarily reside in Australia and bodies incorporated in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 7 sets out the constitutional basis for the bill. It draws on four areas: the external affairs power, under section 51(xxix), to the extent that it gives effect to the three conventions I referred to previously; the defence power, under section 51(vi); the corporations power, under section 51(xx); and the trade and commerce power, under section 51(i). Clause 9 provides that, where a person supplies goods to another, believing or suspecting on reasonable grounds that the goods may be used in a program for the development, production, acquisition or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction&mdash;the so-called WMD program&mdash;a person is guilty of an offence punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 12 refers to the issuing of a ministerial notice if the minister does not believe or suspect that the goods may be used in a WMD program. Clause 13 specifies that a person is not guilty of an offence if the supply of goods is authorised by a permit granted under that particular clause. Clause 14 allows the minister to send out notices prohibiting a person from exporting the goods or services. The minister may issue such notices only if he or she has reason to believe or suspect that the goods or services might be used to assist a WMD program and the minister considers a permit could not be given under clause 13. Such a notice lasts for 12 months. It is an offence for a person to knowingly supply or export goods or services contrary to a notice. The penalty for this is imprisonment for a maximum of eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15 attributes the belief or suspicion of a director, employee or agent acting within his or her authority to the relevant corporation, unless the corporation proves that it took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to avoid the conduct. If a corporation is convicted, section 4B of the Crimes Act 1914 allows a court to impose a fine upon it of up to five times the maximum fine which could be imposed on an individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the issue of our reservations about the bureaucratic demands and potential legal risks of the bill I referred to in opening this debate. The bill imposes additional burdens on companies to become aware of the ultimate use of goods or services that they might provide or export. Although the criminal provisions require a level of intent of belief or suspicion, a jury could attribute suspicion to a company if it held or had access to information which indicates that the goods or services might be used for a WMD program, even if nobody in the company had actually turned his or her mind to it. The company must also take care that none of its directors, employees or agents hold suspicions without alerting the responsible person in the company. Otherwise, the knowledge of the director, employee or agent could be attributed to the company, and this could result in conviction, a fine and confiscation of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes provision that a company in an uncertain position over the so-called end use can at least apply to a minister for a statement upon which it can rely. I point out to the Assistant Treasurer that this burden on companies needs to be balanced against the importance of limiting the capacity of countries to construct weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition therefore hopes that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) will recognise these potential difficulties and ensure that an awareness program arising from this bill is provided to the commercial sector generally and, more specifically, to those industries likely to be affected or with the potential to be affected. We suggest also that the minister disseminate a list of materials and destinations likely to represent cause for concern, although I appreciate that the Assistant Treasurer did make one or two of those points&mdash;albeit briefly&mdash;in his second reading speech. With those caveats, the coalition supports the bill and its underlying commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a few words about the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons&mdash;the so-called NPT&mdash;which provides the international framework for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT, along with the UN charter, are the key documents on international security. The NPT was concluded in 1968 and entered into force in 1970 after ratification by the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom&mdash;the so-called depositary powers of the treaty&mdash;and 40 other states. One of the broad objectives of the treaty is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons to states other than the five states which had already developed nuclear weapons in 1968. These states are United States, the Soviet Union&mdash;Russia has since acceded to these obligations&mdash;the United Kingdom, France and China. Other objectives are to facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation between treaty members, and to work towards general and complete nuclear disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coalition's view, the NPT has become vital to global and regional security. It provides essential assurances for international trade and cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Without the assurances offered by the NPT and the system of International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, distrust of nuclear intentions would feed regional security problems. Without the assurances offered by the NPT, international nuclear cooperation would dwindle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Projections in the 1960s were that 20 to 25 states would have developed or acquired nuclear weapons by the 1980s. Despite challenges to the non-proliferation regime, it is a measure of the treaty's success that such fears have not been realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia ratified the NPT in 1973. Current membership is an impressive 174, reflecting the treaty's success in establishing a norm against nuclear weapons proliferation. Parties include all five of the original nuclear weapon states, as I have already indicated, and most states with advanced nuclear programs, regrettably with Israel, Pakistan and India remaining notable but increasingly isolated exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NPT provides for five-yearly conferences, which have been convened since 1975, to review the operations of the treaty and to make recommendations about its future implementation. This review process will be an important part of the 1995 conference in New York and, despite disappointing progress on disarmament during the Cold War years, the review conferences have nevertheless provided a forum for the international community to continue to maintain pressure on the nuclear weapon states to stop nuclear testing, to halt the arms race and to start nuclear reductions. But much more productive has been the work of successive review conferences in strengthening other key provisions of the treaty, including safeguards, peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear supply, and recommendations for complementary nuclear agreements and arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it very clear to the House that the coalition believes that the NPT makes a vital contribution to international peace and security, as do all ASEAN, Indochinese and north Asian countries and all South Pacific Forum&mdash;except Vanuatu&mdash;members of the NPT. It has provided the framework for the smooth development of the nuclear industry in the region and a firm foundation for the long-term planning and major investments required by nuclear technology. It has facilitated regional nuclear cooperation and trade, as well as trade and cooperation with countries outside the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) might be interested to hear that this side of the House strongly supports the indefinite extension of the NPT in New York in May of this year. We believe that the indefinite extension of the NPT is the best guarantee of the continuation of the international and regional security benefits provided to date by the NPT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also support urgent conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty of indefinite duration. We want to see a thorough review in New York of the operation and effectiveness of that treaty. We want to encourage NPT members to see the conference as an opportunity to shape the environment of the next century so that we can achieve the nuclear-free world we all seek. We do not want to be looking back at what was and what was not done over the past 25 years with the constraints of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note and acknowledge some of the reservations and criticisms of the NPT: that the treaty is discriminatory, dividing countries into nuclear haves and have-nots, and should be rewritten; that nothing serious has been done about nuclear disarmament and there are more nuclear weapons today than in 1968 when the treaty was negotiated; that indefinite extension will legitimise the status of the nuclear weapon states for ever; that the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards are ineffective, as demonstrated in the case of Iraq and North Korea, and do not prevent proliferation; that the NPT has not delivered access to nuclear technology for developing countries and suppliers have imposed export controls which hinder the economic development of developing countries; that nuclear smuggling is the new challenge&mdash;I do not think anybody would disagree with that&mdash;and demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the NPT, with which I hope the House would disagree; and that the NPT has been a failure because it has not attracted the support of key threshold countries such as India, Pakistan and Israel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the coalition believes that the New York conference provides an historic opportunity. We believe it is an appropriate opportunity to continue to strengthen the safeguards, nuclear supply and peaceful uses provisions of the treaty, to build further momentum towards universal membership, and also, for the first time, to lock in the post-Cold War disarmament achievements and to ensure the most propitious environment for future nuclear disarmament. As I said before, that means extending the treaty indefinitely. Anything less would only provide arguments to those who wish to see the disarmament process go no further. It would undermine the normative effect of the treaty, create uncertainty in nuclear trade and send wrong signals to the threshold states about the commitment of NPT parties to this important treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope to see the requirement commitment first-hand when I visit New York. Hopefully, I will be accredited, albeit for just a few hours, to the NPT extension conference. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the chemical weapons convention was finally signed after some 26 years of negotiation. We thought it would never be completed but it was finalised because of the intervention of Australian officials who came forward with a set of words that those UN member countries which actually possessed chemical weapons, or which were involved in their production, could agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia played a key role in finalising that chemical weapons convention. That weapons convention has not yet been ratified by the whole world. For the treaty to be ratified, we need to get some 60 or 70 countries to sign. This legislation and previous legislation that this House has carried are Australia's legislative fulfilment of its obligations. We are hopeful that by next year this chemical weapons convention will be able to come into force. But that is a sign of the very important role Australia has played for many years in trying to achieve disarmament across all of these types of weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend and colleague the member for Groom (Mr Taylor) has outlined the important work that is now under way with regard to the extension and review conference for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The government fully supports the indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We agree&mdash;and I personally agree&mdash;with all the comments that the member for Groom made about the importance of having an indefinite extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and I will be talking a bit about them. I want to make it clear to this House that I, personally, and the government fully support the indefinite extension of that treaty. That is the only signal we can afford to send to the nuclear weapon states, the non-nuclear weapon states and some of those rogue states that want to seek to develop nuclear weapons. The world community does not support the proliferation of nuclear weapons. What the world community wants is the end of nuclear weapons. That is why an indefinite extension is a very important signal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the member for Groom, I also hope that through the indefinite extension we can convince those countries, those nuclear weapon states that are not signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, to come on board. I refer to the states of Israel, India and Pakistan. They are the only three states where it is clearly acknowledged that they have nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a number of other countries which were in the process of developing them&mdash;Argentina and South Africa were two of them&mdash;but they have come on board the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and have ended their development of nuclear weapons. A number of other countries that are signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty did commence the development of them: North Korea and Iraq. However, the world community intervened very strongly and made sure that those two countries ended their development of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, it is important to understand that there are some weaknesses in that treaty. I am hopeful that in the extension review conference that is held at the end of April and early May in New York&mdash;and I am pleased to hear that the member for Groom will get an opportunity to observe that process&mdash;we can tighten up the review procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Groom outlined, one of the weaknesses of the treaty is that it is discriminatory. It protects the nuclear weapon states and maintains their status and leaves all the non-nuclear weapon states in a separate and discriminated status. That is important, because we do not want to see any more countries becoming nuclear weapon states. However, there has been a bit of unfairness in the application of the treaty. A lot of countries that have interests in developing nuclear weapons have had the pressure put on them to cease that development and production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar pressure has not been effectively applied to the nuclear weapon states to stop their further development and enhancement of nuclear weapons and their increasing of stockpiles. It has been acknowledged in this House that the nuclear weapon states now have more than twice as many nuclear weapons as they did when this treaty was ratified in 1970. They have not actually fulfilled their obligations under the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The treaty was developed in an era of the Cold War. I recognise that and there was, of course, a different political dynamic than we have today. But, because we now have a new world political dynamic, it gives us a real opportunity to put into effect review requirements that set much firmer targets and guidelines for the nuclear weapon states. Only two of the nuclear weapon states are actively involved in disarmament: the United States of America and Russia. Countries such as France, Great Britain and China, which are the other large recognised parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, have not engaged in any disarmament negotiations at all. There are no disarmament treaties or arrangements applying to their nuclear stockpiles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time those three parties came on board and joined with the United States of America and Russia in cutting down their stockpiles and meeting their obligations under the treaty. If you read the actual treaty, it makes it clear that the nuclear weapon states are supposed to be part of an active program of disarmament and reducing their nuclear weapon stockpiles. Those three signatory states are not fulfilling their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I personally would like to see, and what a number of my parliamentary colleagues would like to see, is a much tougher regime of review so that each five years, when we are reviewing what is happening, we look back over the previous five years and ask, `What have each of the parties done to fulfil their obligations?' Then, when we report back and determine how they have gone, we set very clear targets for those countries about what we expect to happen in the next five years. We should make it very clear that, as signatories to that treaty, we expect all parties to fulfil their obligations under the treaty in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not diminish in any way the effectiveness of the treaty. What it does seek to do is fulfil some of the obligations of the treaty and make all of the parties to the treaty fulfil their requirements. I think we should be setting some targets for the next five years. We need to conclude a comprehensive ban on all nuclear test explosions. This should come into force completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are agreements and arrangements occurring at the moment. People are saying, `No, we won't.' Bill Clinton has outlined that the United States will not be testing. France has suspended its testing. China, unfortunately, has not suspended its testing. There is no binding agreement on all the states to cease testing. If the United States wanted to change its mind tomorrow, it could. Bill Clinton, as President, has said that he will not, but there is nothing binding in place. There is no regime to effect that decision. We need a comprehensive test ban treaty in place with everybody as signatories and the full force of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to commence and conclude negotiations for a ban on the production of special fissionable materials for weapons purposes and the entry into force of such an agreement. At the moment, there is still a significant production of special fissionable materials occurring around the world. Stockpiles of that material are being made available. We need a complete ban on that production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need an agreement from all nuclear weapon states that they will cease producing new nuclear weapons. At the moment we have some 70,000 nuclear weapons still stockpiled in all the nuclear weapon states, which would mean that we could blow up the earth completely at least 10 times over if we had the desire to. We do not need any more nuclear weapons being added. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now had the end of the Cold War. We have had the end of the dividing of our world between two different groups, where each side had approximately equal numbers of nuclear weapons and forces. We have ended that. There is no need for any member state to have nuclear weapons. Over the next 10 years, every nuclear weapon state should be engaged in a process of destroying their nuclear weapons. It is in the best interests of all member states to do that. Removing those weapons not only ends the tension and the threat to all civilisation but also saves countries money. It enables them to have funds to invest in their people rather than in the production of nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that I also support and am involved with another group in this parliament, and it is being active as well. Parliamentarians for Global Action, which I convene in this Australian parliament, supports a project called the World Court project, which is a case before the International Court of Justice to declare nuclear weapons illegal. That case does not have the support of the Australian government but it does have the support of many other countries and many parliamentarians and people around the world. We are very hopeful that, through the World Court decision, we can get a declaration that nuclear weapons are in fact illegal, that they should cease production and that all member and nuclear weapon states should immediately commence disarmament and destruction of all of those weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is broad international agreement that we need to put in place a comprehensive test ban treaty. The first target that I have set for the nuclear weapon states and the non-nuclear weapon states for the next five years should be achievable. There are concerns around the world about the proliferation of fissionable material. So there should be sufficient goodwill in this world community to achieve a ban on the further production and distribution of fissionable nuclear material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the world community, and within the communities and populations of the member countries that have nuclear weapons, there is a desire to end the threat that nuclear weapons pose to their welfare. It is in the best interests of those countries to also cease further production, further enhancement and further improvements to their nuclear weapons. `Save the money. Invest the money in your people' is the message I would like to give those countries. The community, government and people will certainly benefit from such a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity to attend the final preparatory committee meeting of the extension and review conference for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in January in New York. It was a great pleasure for me to meet and work alongside Mr Ian Cousins, who is the First Assistant Secretary of the International Security Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who heads the Australian delegation in negotiations on the extension review of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. He is a very impressive negotiator for and representative of Australia. I congratulate him and his team on the work they are doing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994, the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Act 1985, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 and the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. In addition, this bill will repeal the Livestock Diseases Act 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Livestock Diseases Act 1978 is to be repealed to remove the Commonwealth's responsibility for exotic disease eradication activities in the Australian Capital Territory and remove the Commonwealth's liability for payment of compensation to ACT producers whose property is destroyed or damaged as a result of exotic disease or associated eradication activities. In addition, the proposed repeal of this act will allow the ACT to join in the Commonwealth-state cost sharing agreement for sharing the costs of exotic animal disease eradication campaigns on an equal basis with the states and the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994 are to address the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, the NRA, commencing registration activities in 1995 and not 1994 as was originally intended. The amendments will enable the collection of levy act to apply for 1995-96 and thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, experience with the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Interim Levy) Act 1994 has identified the requirement for a number of minor amendments which will improve the administrative efficiency of the collection of levy act and hence benefit industry. These amendments include changing the date for payment of the levy from 1 June to 31 July each year. This will remove the necessity for industry to pay both the interim levy and main levy during the 1994-95 financial year. In addition, the NRA will be able to approve levy payments by instalments, thus spreading the cost to industry over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the late penalty payment provisions will allow for those payments to be set by primary legislation, rather than prescribed by regulations. The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 provides the framework for the operations of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, AHC, and its subsidiary product board, the Australian Dried Fruits board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the AHC was established, provision was made in its enabling legislation for the chairperson to report to the annual general meeting of the eligible industry body representing a levy paying industry. In the first few years of the corporation's operation, when there were only a small number of industries participating in the corporation, this approach worked well. However, with nine industries now participating in the corporation, the chairperson of the corporation has been required to undertake a significant additional workload. This workload is likely to increase again in the short term as a number of other industries have signalled their intention to commence levy contributions to the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore proposed to amend the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 to enable other members of the corporation's board to provide the annual report of the corporation's activities to the annual general meetings of eligible industry bodies. This will reduce the burden on the chairperson while at the same time maintaining the accountability linkage between the board of directors and its levy paying constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Australian Dried Fruits Board was established, provision was made in the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 for product boards to convene an annual general meeting for the purposes of reporting on their activities to their levy paying constituents. Two such meetings have been held by the Australian Dried Fruits Board&mdash;the first in June 1993 and the second in June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following representations from the dried vine fruits industry, the government has decided to remove the need for product boards to convene an annual general meeting. The government has accepted the recommendation from the Australian Dried Fruits Association, which is the eligible industry body for dried vine fruit producers, that the chairperson of the Australian Dried Fruits Board report to the annual general meeting of the association. This will replace the need for the Australian Dried Fruits Board, and other product boards which may be established under the act, to hold an annual general meeting. This approach is consistent with the accountability arrangements for the parent body, the Australian Horticultural Corporation, which also reports to the annual general meetings of its eligible industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repeal of the annual general meeting provisions of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 will have a retrospective effect from 1 July 1994. The chairperson of the Australian Dried Fruits Board will be required to present the report of the board's 1993-94 activities to the 1995 annual general meeting of the Australian Dried Fruits Association. This arrangement has the total and unqualified support of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, the Australian Dried Fruits Board and the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Horticultural Research and Development Corporation is a statutory body which was established in 1988 with the responsibility for the coordination and funding of horticultural research and development, R&amp;D. Horticultural industries which participate in the corporation contribute through statutory levies and export charges and voluntary contributions. Expenditure of industry funds on R&amp;D is matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a requirement of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 that the chairperson of the corporation report each year to the annual conference, or a meeting of the executive, of each eligible industry body representing a levy paying industry. As the number of industries now participating in the corporation has increased to 11, the chairperson of the corporation has experienced a similar increase in workload as the chairperson of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 to enable other members of the corporation's board to provide the annual report of the corporation's activities to the annual conference or meeting of the executive of each eligible industry body. This is consistent with the approach being proposed for the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 will extend farm household support to farmers who have reached the pension age. This will provide a further option for farmers who are unable to receive the age pension, or who receive a reduced pension, because they have a relatively high level of farm assets which they are not able to realise. Access to farm household support for this group of farmers will enable them to meet basic living expenses while they arrange for the sale of their property or work to place the farm on a firmer footing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Farm Household Support Act 1992 is being amended to provide for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to authorise payments to a RAS authority that has incurred costs in connection with the issue of drought exceptional circumstances certificates. These certificates are used by farmers applying for drought relief payment, or who wish to have their farm assets excluded from the assets test normally applied to farmers for Austudy, as evidence that their farm enterprise is located in an area affected by drought exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of amending the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Act 1985 arose because the Queensland parliament passed a new act covering fisheries management which was brought into effect in January 1995 before the implications flowing from Commonwealth legislation had been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Queensland Fisheries Management Authority is a new agency constituted under the new act, the Commonwealth guarantee to the Queensland treasury now has no effect as the Commonwealth act which establishes the loan guarantee refers to the old act and the old agency, namely the Queensland Fish Management Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By changing the definition to reflect the current situation in Queensland state legislation, the Commonwealth guarantee for the northern prawn fishery voluntary adjustment scheme can be restored.

A number of rural regions are currently faced with substantial challenges of economic, social and environmental adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 is being amended to allow the rural adjustment scheme, RAS, to operate at a regional level. This will allow RAS to better address the structural adjustment needs of specific regions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A regional approach to RAS would not replace the existing individual based approach. Direct delivery to individual farmers through the state RAS authorities will continue with the two approaches operating in a complementary manner. The proposed changes will allow the Commonwealth the flexibility of dealing directly with farmer groups and organisations involved in rural adjustment, and is an important step in the overall implementation of the regional approach to the scheme.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide for payments to be made directly to beneficiaries, for payments to entities other than farmers under all elements of RAS and for flexible cost sharing arrangements under all elements of RAS, subject to Commonwealth-state agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ability to make direct payments and payments to organisations and groups will allow greater efficiency and effectiveness in program delivery. It will allow, for example, one cheque to be paid directly to a training course facilitator, rather than multiple cheques being paid to individual farmers that attend. It will also allow closer linkages to other programs with direct payment elements such as rural counselling, Landcare, and agribusiness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Activities for support within the framework of regional RAS may include the identification and development of appropriate training courses across the region to address local needs. This may include training on issues such as productivity enhancement options for farm business enterprises, financial management, environmental management, and marketing. Support may also be available for possible further funding of farm exits, and re-training schemes for those leaving the sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flexible cost sharing arrangements allow provision for states or the Commonwealth to make greater funding contributions to regional projects should they so wish. This flexibility is essential to permit RAS assistance to be tailored to regional and community needs. RAS regional initiatives will be implemented consistently with principles for rural regional development developed by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, ARMCANZ. Many communities are already working cooperatively on a range of issues and governments can help foster this locally driven initiative through regional RAS. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's ability to enter into agreements with persons other than states, and to make direct or indirect payments to farmers and persons other than farmers, for the purposes of rural adjustment, is supported by the appropriations power in section 81 and the incidental power in section 51(xxxix) of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a regional context, the Commonwealth funding is intended to be provided for community based activities relating to rural adjustment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the committee's concerns as to the lack of clarity on administrative arrangements, on 3 March 1995 ARMCANZ endorsed in principle the implementation of integrated and community based regional approaches involving the linked implementation of rural programs such as the RAS, NAP, agribusiness programs, and rural communities access program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ARMCANZ also agreed in principle to the early implementation of a rural partnership program, RPP, based on a model incorporating input from the case studies report undertaken by SCARM which focused on south-west Queensland and Sunraysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The framework supported by ARMCANZ involves a competitive bidding process, extensive community consultation, and joint development of regional strategies with the states and the community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The south-west Queensland regional strategy is a pilot project for the development of a regional approach to rural adjustment. The strategy is generally consistent with the ARMCANZ approach, incorporating an integrated package of adjustment measures, including RAS, landcare, and rural counselling. The strategy was initially proposed by community based organisations which recognised the need for rural adjustment within the SWQ region, and is a real partnership between the community and governments at local, state, and Commonwealth levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the original proposed amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill No. 3, PIELAB, address concerns that the RAS may not be implemented in full consultation with the states. They put in place a requirement for all Commonwealth RAS assistance to be the subject of Commonwealth-state agreements, including regional initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been the Commonwealth's intention that, within the broad framework discussed with the states, the detailed administrative arrangements under a regional approach would be developed in consultation with the states on a case by case basis and with their full cooperation and consultation. A successful regional initiative can only be effectively and most efficiently implemented with the full cooperation of all parties, Commonwealth, state and local governments community and industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe that the proposed amendments to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act 1992 will facilitate the achievement of the overall goals of the scheme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After that dissertation, I wondered how long it would take to read the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 in total. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is leaving the House at this moment, certainly gave us a very lengthy explanation as to what the amendments to the bill will mean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition previously supported the majority of this bill but was concerned that amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 might mean that the federal government could decide land use for an area without consulting the states which have the constitutional power for land use. Listening to the minister, our concerns had basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has been actively trying to whip up local support for restructuring&mdash;and I refer to two areas of New South Wales, the western and central west&mdash;in a way which looks to the outsider as a bottoms-up approach. But when you take a closer look at it, it is really a tops-down approach and being driven more from the federal government. The coalition does not object to the concept of the rural adjustment scheme being used on a regional area basis, but it wants to ensure that the states are in agreement with the plan and that restructuring is not imposed on an area which does not want to be restructured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister in his explanation a moment ago pointed to the south-west Queensland strategy, which is a pilot scheme that was developed by the people of the south-west Queensland mulga lands. As they are all my constituents, I have taken a very close interest in the development of the south-west Queensland strategy. I believe that the people of south-west Queensland were the driving force behind the development of a regional approach to rural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Life</EMPHASIS>, the President of the Warrego Graziers Association, Mr Rigby, when reporting to his association in Charleville, said that the wheels have fallen off the south-west Queensland strategy. This is a practical grazier who has been grazing sheep and cattle in those very harsh mulga lands in south-west Queensland for more than 20 years. The president of that association has to be a pretty tough nut. He is going to have to stick up for those people out there and understand the problems of the community. I would like the House to bear in mind that the Warrego Graziers Association has always been behind a regional approach to the rural adjustment package. In his report last week, Mr Rigby said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the South West Strategy has been "fooled about with" by every conceivable government department.</PARA>
<PARA>When you listen to the minister's explanation of the amendments to this act you can understand the concerns of Mr Rigby. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was no longer recognisable and was being used as "carrots" to encourage graziers into areas like property management and planning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, our right to implement our own management decisions is under very grave threat.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . help was not available unless landholders had an approved property management plan, or signed property enterprise agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>For these enterprise agreements or property management plans to be understood by people in capital cities, they must understand that the south-west Queensland area is a very large part of Queensland, that towns are not just dotted every 20 or 30 miles, and that the people who could approve these plans are not every 20 or 30 miles down the road. That is what he is referring to when he said that he believed that this had been fooled about by every conceivable level of government and is at grave risk of running off the tracks. Mr Rigby said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remain very hesitant about the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I fully support and commend the effort and expertise that has gone into establishing the scheme, and while I</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">most totally support our original aim of property build up in the mulga lands of south west Queensland, the scheme has gone much further and I believe to its detriment.</PARA>
<PARA>The concerns of the President of the Warrego Graziers Association&mdash;we should bear in mind that this was the pilot scheme for a rural approach to rural adjustment in this country&mdash;bears out our concerns on this side of the House, and that is why we had this bill sent up to a Senate committee to be investigated.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition's decision to send the bill to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee resulted from the lack of information about how the rural adjustment scheme and the regional plans would work, how they would be funded, and whether they would be constitutionally acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns have been borne out by the committee's report, as the minister suggested in his explanatory memorandum. Whilst recommending that the bill be passed without amendments, the Senate committee recorded its concerns that the explanatory memorandum, and in particular the second reading speech, did not contain detailed information on the proposed amendments to the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were our concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. The honourable member for Wakefield, coming from South Australia with a rural constituency, certainly understands the concerns that we had and the concerns his constituents had. The Attorney-General's Department had concerns. Its report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administrative arrangements to be undertaken by the Commonwealth in relation to the new non-state-based component of the RAS are not clear from the available material. It is this lack of information which appears to be of concern to the Parliamentary Research Service. In the absence of that information, it is not possible to form a view whether the proposed administrative arrangements would be valid.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Attorney-General's Department in scrutinising this bill. The committee concluded that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the minister must provide information that will allow the parliament to make informed judgments when considering legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy said that funding for rural adjustment scheme regional plans would come from the underspends of each state&mdash;in other words, the underspent amount of each state's rural adjustment funding. The coalition is concerned at evidence given by Mr Malcolm Smith from the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria who said that the federal government wanted to impose a levy on states on top of the underspends, which would create a larger pot of money. Mr Smith correctly pointed out that the Victorian government would not be happy to provide finance for a regional restructuring plan in Queensland. He is quite correct. Quite rightly, any state that puts money into a scheme must receive the benefits for its own citizens. As I said earlier, it is the right of the state to manage the land administration arrangements of the state. The Victorian concerns were also of concern to the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition is aware that the regional restructuring area in Queensland&mdash;which is in my own electorate&mdash;appears to be welcomed by the people in that area. They were originally very supportive of the scheme. They continue to be supportive of the scheme, but they do not want to be run over by a federal government trying to impose unnecessary conditions on this very important approach to regional adjustment. They want it to be driven from the bottom up&mdash;at the grassroots level. These are the people who are out there in the paddocks in the south-west Queensland areas. No-one better understands the problem of the mulga lands or of any rural area than the people who are working it on a day-to-day basis. For this reason, the coalition is pleased that the government has finally agreed to put forward an amendment in line with the Senate committee's dissenting report which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a minimum, the legislation should be amended to require the Commonwealth to consult with the States on regional adjustment initiatives, fully recognising that the States have the responsibility for land management.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's amendment ensures that a regional restructuring program cannot go ahead without the agreement of the particular state or territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were not for the concerns of members on this side of the House, a bill would have been passed through this parliament which would have seen the federal government gaining greater control over the rural reconstruction packages out there in rural Australia. Thank goodness the people on this side of the House understand the concerns of those people out in rural Australia. This bill demonstrates yet again the lack of understanding or the lack of knowledge of the problems confronted by people in rural Australia. Whilst this is a small example, it is another example of the arrogance not only of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) but also of those people who would have had a say in the bill when it was brought forward to their caucus committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other government amendments are to the Farm Household Support Act 1992. These amendments are to allow the Commonwealth to reimburse the states for the costs incurred by state rural adjustment scheme authorities in issuing drought exceptional circumstances certificates. These certificates play a very important role. They are certainly being widely used in my own electorate and in many parts of New South Wales. Unfortunately, they are not being issued in Victoria or in some parts of New South Wales which are in desperate need of a declaration of exceptional circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These certificates are used for the purposes of drought relief payments and concessions under the Austudy assets test as evidence that farm enterprises are affected by drought exceptional circumstances. The expected cost to the Commonwealth is $240,000. At this point, I would like to congratulate the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee which today reported to the Senate its finding on the impact of Austudy on rural families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another coalition initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. I commend the chairman of that committee, Senator Brownhill, a member from the central regions of New South Wales. He is one of those from a drought declared area who is not carrying an exceptional circumstances declaration. In that report to the Senate the committee recommended to abolish the assets test on farm assets. Some of the evidence in that report highlights the lack of understanding of the plight of those families in rural Australia. The great tragedy of the assets test, as it is applied and as it is still being applied in this country, is that the children out there in rural Australia are being denied an education. The assets of parents are stripping their children from being able to receive Austudy and gain secondary or tertiary education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Andrew" NAMEID="HE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr Andrew</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And they have to be boarders.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. This is another matter that those opposite do not understand. There is not a university on every corner of our electorates. In many cases, there is not even a complete secondary education out there in rural Australia. I draw on the experience of my own electorate. Many towns have educational opportunities to year 10. People living in many of those rural towns have to send their children away to a regional centre to complete even secondary education. When it comes to university or tertiary education, they usually have to go to a capital city. I would like to know how on earth the government thinks that assets in a drought declared area or assets in a farm situation will constitute an ability to pay for children's education. So often we see that education and access to it in capital cities is taken as a right, but out there in rural Australia it seems as though the government thinks it can apply different rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The interesting thing in that report is that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy identified that 5,400 students would benefit from the removal of the assets test. They would have been eligible under the income test but were being tripped out because of the assets test. On this day, 5,400 students are being tripped out of any assistance in terms of Austudy support because of their parents' assets. Their parents' income clearly means they can qualify, but their parental assets trip them out of assistance from the federal government. I welcome that report, and I congratulate the chairman of that committee for bringing forward that report. Quite clearly, the evidence received out there by committee members was evidence that they listened to. They have certainly understood the plight of those many rural families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's approach has been to issue these exceptional circumstances certificates which means that, with the students out there in these drought areas, their parents' on-farm assets will not be considered in terms of Austudy eligibility. I would ask the minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Eduction and Training (Mr Free) to look at that report very carefully and to consider it in the context of the removal of the assets test on farm assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just a deplorable situation that, in the 21st century, a report of a parliamentary committee presented to the Senate today identified 5,400 students in rural Australia who are being denied federal government assistance because of a very unfair assets test that has been applied by this Labor government. If this government does not take notice of that report, it will demonstrate yet again the arrogance not only of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) but of the Labor Party as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>The other aspect of the bill that I want to comment on briefly is the Northern Prawn Fishery Voluntary Adjustment Scheme Loan Guarantee Act 1985. To assist with the restructure of the northern prawn fishery, the Commonwealth government guaranteed a loan obtained from the Queensland Treasury Corporation to a maximum of $40.9 million. The loan was paid to the Queensland Fish Management Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government has since dissolved this authority and established a new body, which took over the previous body's assets, rights and liabilities from 27 January this year. Because of the name change the Commonwealth guarantee no longer legally applies. The Queensland government wants it reinstated to the newly-named body to cover the $13.3 million still owed. Quite clearly, that scheme is working well because the original loan for $40.9 million is now down to $13.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The northern prawn and fishing industry plays a very important part in providing job opportunities in northern Australia, particularly in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The industry has entered this restructuring scheme on a voluntary basis; in other words, it is being driven by the fishermen and the people involved in the industry. It is good to see that it has paid off some of that debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no objections to the government's amendments. We are pleased to see that, on this occasion, the government has listened to the Senate recommendations on this bill and accepted these amendments. I feel that, if the government can listen to and read very carefully that Austudy report that was introduced into the Senate today, if it can listen as well as it has listened on this occasion, then perhaps we can progress things for those people out there in rural Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who preceded me, has laid out the case very well. He was appreciative of the efforts of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in making valuable additions to this Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). I will concentrate on two or three issues in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do that I would reiterate my belief&mdash;as I said yesterday in my speech on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (Drought Relief Measures)&mdash;that the rural adjustment scheme, and the farm household support as part of that, can only ever be a very poor second-best to sound economic policy. The point I made yesterday was that when Peter Walsh abolished the old IED scheme he should have put something in its place&mdash;as he acknowledged in December of last year. While I was angry yesterday when I remembered that and I expressed that anger in my speech, and I still feel that, at least he was honourable enough to acknowledge that he should have put something in its place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a decade we have had an agricultural industry that has been exposed more than it has ever been, or had been in the last 70 or 80 years, I suggest, certainly since the Great Depression. So the rural adjustment scheme, which, I guess, parliaments and politicians from time to time make great play of, can only ever be second-best to sound economic policies and policies which encourage individuals to be able to take good care of them selves. </PARA>
<PARA>I note that the speech given by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) talks about a regional component; it talks about flexibility; and it talks about the Commonwealth-State agreement. When I look at farm household support, I just want to emphasise flexibility. I know there are hangovers, if you like, preceding this current round of federal government drought legislation where the household support is being held over people's heads. I would just encourage the government to look at any outstanding issues of household support. I hope that this legislation picks it up; I am not sure that it will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is made that people have to `arrange for the sale of their property or work to place the farm on a firmer footing'. In some of these drought situations around the country, quite frankly, the properties are unsaleable. I really emphasise to the government: please allow the flexibility that you talk about in your speech here tonight. The regional component of the rural adjustment scheme is one that we must handle with great care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. That committee will meet at Kimba on Saturday morning to look at the region of Eyre Peninsula. I am sure that we in this House would wish the committee well in its deliberations. The reason I am cautioning great care upon the government is that careless words create unnecessary headlines. Two or three months ago we saw headlines running in both the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> and a South Australian farm paper which talked about fairly significant inducements to remove people from their farms. The wave of resentment, anger and frustration that went around Eyre Peninsula was something that I would not care to see repeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the efforts of the Senate rural and regional affairs committee in trying to bring a greater sense of balance to this legislation. Here we are not just dealing with markets, rationalists and export income; we are dealing with people's lives. These people have come from a great tradition over many generations. They are under great pressure, and probably have not been under greater pressure since the Great Depression&mdash;and some would say it is even greater than that. I am sure that we would wish the committee under the chairmanship of Caroline Schaefer all the best in planning for the future and developing a vision for Eyre Peninsula. We hope that this legislation will give the appropriate umbrella so that people might see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the spirit of flexibility, which this legislation talks about, I encourage the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) in the other place to consider the application from that small section of Jervois county, under the district council area of Cleve, to look at the application with sympathy because I understand that the rainfall statistics are certainly within the guidelines of RASAC. Those people would very much appreciate an opportunity to participate in that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To highlight my personal involvement in the industry, in the 12 months from January to December 1994 the rainfall I experienced on my own farm was two inches below anything that I had ever experienced and, I would suggest, this century. My area will not be able to participate in the program&mdash;and I am certainly not asking that it should be&mdash;but I mention the fact that I had rainfall of 350 points or just under 100 millimetres.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) is an omnibus bill which amends several primary industry acts. The coalition sent it to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee because there was a fear that the government may use the rural adjustment scheme to interfere in land use without consulting the states and to force people out of farming in a regional restructure, against the wishes of the local community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that Senate committee's dissenting report, an amendment is required. The government has moved other amendments which now have to be considered. It is these other amendments I want to talk about because one of them is anti-Victorian.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria cannot get these certificates because the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and RASAC have not visited the area, nor will they provide drought relief for north central Victoria, which is experiencing the absolute worst drought in its history. I understand that RASAC, the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee, will be visiting the area next Saturday under the chairmanship of Neil Inall.

I can tell you that this is an anti-Victoria stance. It has adopted a regional approach in terms of drought, but the whole region of north central Victoria is gripped by the most dreadful drought in its history. These exceptional circumstances certificates are used for the purposes of drought relief payments. My constituents in central Victoria cannot get these certificates because the Commonwealth government&mdash;the federal Labor government&mdash;will not declare the area a drought area. </PARA>

They are going into another season. They have to borrow yet more money to ensure that they can plant for next season. All the costs are up-front. They have to buy fuel, seed and superphosphate. They have to borrow the money. They have to make the decision now to borrow the money, to go to the banks to seek additional financial support, and put themselves further and further into debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is about the Farm Household Support Act 1992. It says it will do all these wonderful things at an expected cost to the Commonwealth of $240,000. That does not seem a lot of money to me. If some of my farming constituents could get their hands on $240,000, plus the certificate to get drought relief under the exceptional circumstances provisions, it would certainly help them greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the minister at the table. I would have taken the opportunity to appeal to the Assistant Treasurer, because he has a role in this. It is time the Assistant Treasurer, the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy did something. It should not take until May. That is the time the government says it will take to get drought relief, even if it is approved by the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee. If they went down this weekend and had a look at the area and saw the condition it is in, surely they could make a decision within seven to 14 days&mdash;not let it run on until May. It is decision making time for these farmers now. They have to decide whether they will borrow that additional money and put in a crop for next year in the hope that they will have a decent season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to both ministers in this chamber to go to Senator Collins and get some action out of him, because it is absolutely desperate. Without the assistance of the Commonwealth, the state can only do a limited amount, and it is doing that to the best of its ability and financial resources. The Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, Bill McGrath, has been a very valuable ally to these farmers. He has been pushing and doing everything possible to assist them by providing whatever relief he can from the state's resources. It now requires the assistance of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without that financial assistance&mdash;a whole farming community, where there are third and fourth generation farmers, is talking about leaving the land&mdash;we could lose a whole generation of farmers, and that would be an absolute tragedy. They are all efficient farmers. They produce high quality products which go to export markets, but without the assistance of the Commonwealth and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy those people will pack up and leave the land in central Victoria. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wakefield)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (9.55 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all other speakers have indicated, we are dealing tonight with government amendments in the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1994. Coalition speakers are prominent on the speakers list for this bill because we are proud that the coalition has been largely responsible for the amendments which have occurred in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the original legislation came before the House, while the coalition welcomed much of it, we expressed concern about the lack of regional input into the rural adjustment scheme as it was to be amended by the legislation. In the Senate the coalition sought the referral of this legislation to a Senate committee, and it is to the credit particularly of coalition senators Crane and Panizza that the changes that we have before the House now were recommended by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The Senate committee of inquiry had its genesis in the enthusiasm the coalition had for greater cooperation between regional bodies and the government in the implementation of any form of rural assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest those introductory remarks seem a little too partisan, I should add that concerns about the way this legislation has been structured were not only expressed by the coalition. The Attorney-General's Department also said that it felt that the administrative arrangements laid down in these legislative changes were not clear. The amendments that are being considered tonight, referred to this chamber by the Senate, call for greater consultation between the Commonwealth bodies, the state bodies and regional bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the administration of the rural adjustment scheme and in the RAS act arrangements, there is enthusiasm now, as a result of this call for consultation, for cooperation between the regional bodies and the administrators of the RAS act and consultation with the state governments, as they administer this form of rural assistance. This level of consultation is entirely appropriate, and the coalition believes that it should never have been necessary for the coalition to seek these amendments in the first place because the need for this sort of consultation should have been apparent to the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land management, which is fundamentally what rural adjustment is all about and which gives people the opportunity to make changes in their farming lifestyle under the RASAC scheme, is a state issue. Had this legislation proceeded without the changes that the coalition and, more accurately, the Senate committee sought, then this state authority in land management would have been further unwittingly eroded by this Commonwealth act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, we now have a situation where, thanks to these amendments, there will be consultation where the concerns that the Attorney-General's Department had expressed are now cleared up and the administrative arrangements that were once cloudy are now much more transparent and satisfactory from the point of view of both the government and the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All speakers dealing with this legislation have emphasised that these changes to rural assistance deal with people in need. In fact, the amendments currently being considered by the House provide an opportunity for reimbursement to the state governments where drought exceptional circumstances certificates are issued to farmers in particular need. These drought exceptional circumstances certificates allow farmers who are in need and in drought declared areas to access both drought relief payments, which they clearly need in order to put food on their tables, and, significantly, Austudy payments regardless of their assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has already made it perfectly plain, and has been quite unequivocal, that one of the major problems facing farmers in his area, in my area or in drought declared areas of Australia is their inability to access tertiary education for their teenaged children, principally because they do not have the income. They have the assets. Frequently these assets in drought declared areas cannot be sold. The assets prevent them accessing Austudy. Under the arrangements that are currently considered for drought exceptional circumstances certificates, it will be possible for them, in spite of their assets, to access Austudy. This recognises that their income is so low that, were those assets in any form other than farm assets, they would have been able to access Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absurdity of the Austudy arrangements is that many farmers who have assets of over $1 million cannot access Austudy. If those assets were in a house in Double Bay or in a house in West Lakes in South Australia, they would have the capacity to access Austudy. It is a capacity which has been denied to them, unless they are eligible for drought exceptional circumstances certificates. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does seem to be grossly unfair. I recognise, as does the coalition, that the government appreciates the fact that farm assets are relatively unproductive and has doubled the asset level for farmers. In the circumstances in which much of Australia currently finds itself, as the member for Maranoa said, that does not allow a large number of farmers to access tertiary education for their children. Without that tertiary education, their children are doomed to a lesser standard of living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A part of my electorate is drought stricken, but it is not drought declared. I do not stand here tonight pleading that it should be drought declared, because the circumstances are not as dire as those outlined by the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). It is an illustration of just how capricious climatic conditions can be that within one hour of the city of Adelaide is country that is currently occupied by people who see this land as land that has a capacity to be subdivided to offer accommodation for commuters to Adelaide. That land is probably overinflated in value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of those farmers, because of the shortage of rain, are unable to make ends meet in this financial year. It is a very narrow strip of country. It probably starts about where the city of Gawler is and ends at about the town of Tarlee. This land runs through the centre of South Australia and is in my electorate. It is some of Australia's prime grain growing country and certainly is South Australia's prime grain growing country. It is just north of Adelaide. It is decidedly dry. The farmers are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. They will not qualify for drought assistance. As their representative, I do not think that I can stand here and realistically claim that they should qualify. I can claim that, had the government recognised just how unpredictable farming can be, it would have taken action to maintain the income equalisation deposits scheme that the Fraser government put in place and so allow these farmers to make preparations for years such as these. My farmers are not coming to me pleading for government intervention, but it is obvious that their capacity to budget and to prepare for the downturn that they are experiencing now has been frustrated by the government's inability to provide the same sort of IED scheme as the Fraser government once had in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Bendigo said, the amendment would allow those farmers who are, as my farmers are, in sufficiently difficult circumstances to qualify for the drought exceptional circumstances certificates to access Austudy. That amendment alone would cost the government a mere quarter of a million dollars, which is very little in terms of the total drought outlay and the total losses being faced by farmers who currently cannot make ends meet simply because there has been too little rain. In taking into consideration just what drought has done to Australia and how slow the government has been to respond, it is rather chastening that much of the initial work done to assist farmers was by volunteers like the CWAs across Australia and by public figures like prominent television personalities such as Ray Martin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is little known is that in my state last week an initiative was launched by the premier of South Australia, Mr Dean Brown. In cooperation with the chairman of John Shearer Ltd, Andrew Gwinnett, Mr Brown launched a campaign to be known as `Seeds of hope'. The South Australian government made available $10,000. It is hoped that through public funding this $10,000 will grow to allow the John Shearer organisation to administer a fund that will enable drought stricken farmers to get, without any cost to them at all, the seeds they need to sow this year's crop. I commend John Shearer for this initiative. They are offering all the administrative arrangements without charge. I also commend the Premier of South Australia for his preparedness to be identified with the program and to make $10,000 available as foundation funding. This will mean that farmers whose situation is so desperate that they cannot afford the seed to sow this year's crop will have access to free seed and will be assured not only of a harvest his year but also of the opportunity to once again be proud and independent Australians who are able to look after their land without being dependent on handouts either of the charitable form or from governments. I think that deserves a mention and deserves commendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I deal with the legislation before the House and the changes that will occur in drought stricken Australia, let me say that the government&mdash;I could say the parliament but I guess it is fairer to say the government&mdash;in making drought assistance available to Australian farmers has probably committed Australian taxpayers to some $270 million or $300 million. If we were generous we could say $400 million. That includes funding for rural councils and all other assistance, which is difficult to measure. That seems like a reasonable sum. When you consider that it takes only the smallest movement in interest rates to cost Australian farmers billions of dollars, you begin to see not only how relatively insignificant this total package is&mdash;I do not mean that in an ungracious way&mdash;but also how essential responsible, total economic management is. If farmers had a predictable economy they would be much better able to cope with the fluctuations in weather that characterise Australian farming. My plea once again is for the government to recognise the desperate situation of farmers. They need some predictable economic circumstances and the opportunity to access an effective IED scheme. They are anxious to be independent and proud Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter which has not been referred to in the debate tonight because the focus has tended to be entirely on the drought is that the original bill&mdash;the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;also included a change to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and changes to the administration and meeting obligations of the Australian Dried Fruits Board. I mention this because what is currently widely mooted in the dried fruits community and the grape wine community is the proposal advocated in the recently released draft report of the committee of inquiry into the wine and wine grape industry which suggested a change in the way in which the wine industry is taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be aware&mdash;I know the member for Mallee is well aware of the proposal that came out; it has an immediate impact on the dried fruit industry&mdash;that there is to be a change in the taxation on wine so that a volumetric tax is imposed. The three commissioners of inquiry into the wine grape and wine industry came out with a divided report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One commissioner brought out a minority report advocating a sales tax of 32 per cent and a volumetric tax or excise of $4 a litre. The other two commissioners brought out a majority report advocating a sales tax of 10 per cent and a volumetric tax of $4 per litre of alcohol. I mention this in the closing stages of this debate because it is significant that the one person who advocated a minority report did so recognising that a volumetric tax would impact most unfairly on what are called non-premium varieties of grapes. The dried vine fruits industry, which is covered by a part of this bill, is the principal grower of what are called non-premium varieties. I refute the term `non-premium' because it implies inferiority. That is not true at all. They are superior dried vine fruit varieties but are inferior in the eyes of winemakers; important, but inferior. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House needs to appreciate two things. Firstly, any form of volumetric tax, any form of excise, per litre of alcohol means that premium varieties put into, for example, a red wine at $22 a bottle, containing a certain amount of alcohol at $4 a litre, may result in an increase in the cost of that $22 bottle of, say, $4. But a cask made from the non-premium varieties also has a similar amount of alcohol in it and this would result in the price of a $5 cask increasing by $4. Clearly, that is a very inequitable way to go about taxing this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this point because, if the government were to entertain any form of excise at all, it should look at what the change in excise did to the brandy industry. A graph of brandy production in Australia indicates that as excise rose across the graph brandy production fell. There is a real risk for the wine industry in the application of an excise and what it may do to the industry. But should such an excise be considered? It should not be considered unless there was an opportunity to relieve the excise on brandy and so allow some of the non-premium varieties to go back into the brandy industry because they would no longer be in demand in the wine industry. These are the very varieties that the dried fruit industry currently depends on for its export market and it sees the brandy industry as a safety valve for that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to commend the government for the changes that it has made in adopting the coalition's recommendations to ensure there is greater consultation in the application of its drought assistance. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to the Weapons of Mass Destruction (Prevention of Proliferation) Bill 1995, it is very important to define weapons of mass destruction. It is a term used to describe nuclear, biological and chemical weapons which are capable of resulting in mass destruction of a population. Australia is a party to three international treaties concerned with the control and reduction of weapons of mass destruction. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which was ratified in Australia on 23 January 1973, is substantially implemented by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction, which was ratified by Australia on 5 October 1977, is substantially implemented by the Crimes (Biological Weapons) Act 1976. A Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction was ratified on 6 May 1994, but has not yet come into force internationally. It will be substantially implemented by the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, which will come into force on a date to be proclaimed or upon the convention coming into force. I think it is very useful to let the parliament know just where we stand as far as our adherence to the treaty is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have before me a research paper published as late as March this year, entitled `Crunch Time for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'. In annex C, there are a few facts and figures about the NPT. The paper states that 173 countries are members of it and that Taiwan and Yugoslavia are not counted. It is a pity that recognition was not given to Taiwan in the United Nations, but the following 14 countries have not yet acceded to the treaty: Angola; Brazil; Chile; Comoros; Cuba; Djibouti; Federated States of Micronesia; India, which has a population of some 800 million; Israel, which is a small nation in the Middle East; Oman; Pakistan; Palau; United Arab Emirates; and Vanuatu. It is important to recognise that those 14 countries have not yet acceded to the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation implements our adherence to the treaty and, in endorsing it this way, is fully responding to our full obligations. I have also received some letters from Greenpeace. Annex D in the research paper has suggested a 25-year timetable for achieving complete nuclear disarmament. The point being made by Greenpeace is that this legislation does nothing to implement that timetable. The concern is that, without that implementation, our legislation itself could be deficient and the treaty certainly could be. Greenpeace's news release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, though, the Nuclear Weapons States have not kept their part of the "bargain". Since the NPT came into force in 1970, the arsenals of the Nuclear Weapons States have increased massively. 75,000 new nuclear weapons have been deployed and hundreds of nuclear tests conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A member of Non-Nuclear Weapon State signatories, such as Indonesia and Mexico, now want to strengthen the disarmament commitments in the NPT by introducing a timetable or set goals for the elimination of nuclear weapons. Their proposals would see the NPT extended for fixed periods, such as five years, with disarmament goals to be met within these periods.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes very much back to the timetable within that. It does highlight a particular point on disarmament right across the world in that, as circumstances vary over time, we adopt one standard and then move on to another. Certainly, the big variance in this regard is the ending of the Cold War, the pulling down of the Berlin Wall and the fragmentation of the USSR into many smaller nations, Russia still being the most predominant. It allows a different set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, some of the 13 nations that previously were part of the USSR&mdash;I will not say all of them&mdash;now have access to nuclear weapons. Also, we know there is a problem in that, in the disarming of some of those nuclear weapons, they might be transferred to other countries which might be non-signatories or signatories. The important point to make is that, as I understand it, the signing of a treaty does not necessarily commit a country to adhering to the principles of a treaty. Clause 7 sets out the constitutional basis of the bill. It relies on the following constitutional powers:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the external affairs power (s.51 (xxix)) to the extent that it gives effect to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Biological Weapons Convention</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chemical Weapons Convention</EMPHASIS>, or to the extent that the matters are external to Australia or matters of international concern;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the defence power (s.51 (vi));</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the corporations power (s.51 (xx)); and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the trade and commerce power (s.51(i)).</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important to note that it is the external affairs power of the constitution that enables us to adhere to our treaty commitments by virtue of this bill. It might seem very grand that 173 countries are members of the NPT but, of those 173 countries, how many have individually legislated&mdash;as Australia has&mdash;through their external affairs power to actually put this into force?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that, while a lot of people see a treaty signed as being cast in concrete and having particular powers, it does not have the power until it is legislated in the government of the member country. While we are adhering to it, how many of these other countries that are signatories are yet to do it? My particular concern&mdash;and I think it would be the concern of everyone&mdash;is the manner in which the nuclear weapons of mass destruction in the former areas of Russia are being treated. I am particularly concerned because we know there are countries throughout the world that are very anxious to increase their nuclear weapons. I mentioned India, which is a non-signatory. There is also Iraq and a number of other countries, including North Korea, which was a crisis point last year. The Greenpeace document says that Indonesia and Mexico have a particular interest in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I was fortunate to be selected by this parliament, along with the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), to represent the Australian parliament at the 49th General Assembly. I was not involved in the discussions, but it gave me a lot of pleasure to be able to sit in on some of the discussions of the Western nations, of which Australia forms a bloc, where these matters were treated seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that Australia very strongly support the Indonesian and Mexican situation to ensure that a timetable is there. The protagonists of such a move were some of the present nuclear states. We mentioned five of the nuclear states. I believe that some of those were resistant to the lodging of a timetable. I agree with Greenpeace that we need a definite timetable within the treaty and all countries to become partners to that obligation by legislating, as we have done here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as treaties are concerned, my experience with the United Nations is that you can sign treaties but they are not binding outside the UN. The UN has no power of enforcement. I think it is very important to realise that some countries&mdash;for example, France&mdash;will sign and endorse all treaties. But France does not adhere to any of the treaties of the United Nations. Again I ask: to what extent has France legislated to make it enforceable on itself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the United Nations can give many examples of countries that will not sign treaties but will adhere to most of them. To put that in context, while we are legislating to bind Australia, its citizens and its corporations to this treaty, it does not necessarily mean that there is a grand world out there where the UN has an enforcement capacity. It does not. The only enforcement capacity comes from the inside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the Cold War. Just this year, the Public Works Committee was privileged to examine the Maralinga site with a view to approving work there to reduce the danger that still exists from plutonium-contaminated sand and other material. At the time it all happened, science was not even able to experiment with these devices, let alone treat the consequences of them. When you go out there now, you appreciate that somebody is trying to do something in a modern context with modern technology to ensure that the situation is controlled. I do not think we should look over our shoulder and cast all the blame on the Brits, the French, the Americans or anyone else who worked on this technology at that earlier time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For their part in the discussions held at the 49th assembly, I have to pay particular tribute to Richard Starr and the other members of the Australian team who came over from Geneva. They put their hearts and souls into it, working almost 24 hours a day while they were there to get an agreement on adherence to a timetable for the Mexican-Indonesian situation. I have to say that Australians are regarded almost as a neutral factor in a lot of the things that happen at the United Nations because, although we are attached to the Europeans, we are isolated in the Southern Hemisphere. Everything on which Australia takes a view is listened to. We are regarded as one of the arbitrators within the United Nations, getting agreement between different factions. In the discussions on weapons of mass destruction and in the agreements drawn up, Australia was a lively and well-briefed participant and our views were well regarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dangers posed to our modern society are very evident. I have already mentioned countries, such as North Korea, Iraq and former USSR states, that do not know what to do with their nuclear weapons. I also mention the more recent chemical weapons attacks on the Kurds in Iraq and the nerve gas that was released in the Japanese subway as examples of terrorist activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first lessons that the member for Jagajaga and I received at the United Nations mission was that, for all the work it does, the UN requires the almost unanimous approval of 184 nations in order to bring forward a convention. I regard it as the system of the lowest common denominator: you keep dropping your standards until you get agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting to see that the UN is very lively now that the Republicans have the majority in the US Congress and are renewing the call for sovereign rights. That is something that is applicable to Australia. I have no problem with the use of the external affairs power in this instance, but the Americans are asking how far they can let their sovereignty go to organisations within the UN. While I was there it was suggested that America's share of the UN budget, which is currently 30 per cent, be dropped to 25 per cent. That was causing a lot of concern within United Nations circles. The World Trade Organisation and GATT are not creatures of the UN, but it is typical of the Americans' new claim to sovereignty that they have said they will enter into the new World Trade Organisation with this caveat: in 12 months time they will revisit the situation to ensure that what they have signed away will not affect their sovereign rights. That is a very important change in an era of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year sees the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. Out of the respect in which it is held by Australians, Richard Butler, the Australian mission head, will share in the celebrations. It appears to me that over those 50 years the UN has extended its activities quite considerably. Where it once had expertise in certain limited areas, it has since expanded its activities and its public service to the point where it is today a kind of jack of all trades and master of none. For example, while it has developed techniques of peacekeeping, its peacekeeping efforts are not coordinated; its peacekeeping does not flow the way it should. While the UN is held to be the authority on peacekeeping, it is not doing all that well in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major concerns of the UN&mdash;in fact, one of the world's major concerns&mdash;is the destructive capability of the landmines that have been sown in their millions throughout warring countries in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere. This poses a significant problem because in their collective entirety they could be regarded as a weapon of mass destruction. A question was asked about that this week during question time. It is something that should be given serious consideration because like the plutonium at Maralinga&mdash;which is there, which will stay there, and which will be a problem for the next 24,000 years of its half-life&mdash;these landmines will be active for many years to come. There is a need for the United Nations, working in consultation with its member nations, to come to an agreement on the supply of these weapons&mdash;all Western nations, even though they are members of the United Nations, are guilty in that respect&mdash;on the control of their proliferation, and on the way to fix the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience of the UN makes me feel that there is a need for major reconstruction and a major look at its activities in this its 50th year. I hope that will be the case. Australia is the voice of experience, and I believe we are held in respect by other member nations. </PARA>

<PARA>I am very flattered about this. I think about it and I say, `Hang on a minute. I was not even alive during World War II and I am going to get a medal for it.' I really have to say that this is quite extraordinary. Why is it that a minister of the Crown has written to me, has written to my colleague the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) and has written to my colleague the member for Barker saying that we are going to get a medal for service during World War II? I have to say in all honesty that I cannot accept it because I was not even alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises very serious points. This government seems to take great delight in criticising some members of the opposition for the fact that they have received information from people involved with the government and then has turned around and made very gross accusations because those people have actually opened the letters. I have opened this letter because it was addressed to me, just as my colleague the member for Barker opened some mail that was addressed to him. This is the extraordinary thing: he received some mail that was addressed to him and opened it, yet the government turned around and made some great fabrication that, because his mail was addressed to him and he opened it, he should be held in some sort of contempt of this parliament. Even though the government had ensured, through its own mechanisms, that this mail was sent to him and that he should open it, the government feels he should be held responsible for the fact that this was not meant to be directed to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that this mail was directed very clearly to me. In fact, it was directed to my electorate office. It has today's date but has not been sent to my electorate&mdash;it has been sent straight to me in my Parliament House office&mdash;and, obviously, I have opened it. What is the difference between this mail being sent to my office in Hamilton but arriving at my office here in Canberra and the mail that was supposedly under the control of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner)? Apparently, he will not accept responsibility for the fact that the mail that was supposed to be directed to his office did not in fact arrive there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise a very serious question about the government seeming to have two standards. There was the mail that they found politically advantageous to them and there is the mail here which is a real embarrassment. It is a very real embarrassment because it was sent to a number of members of the opposition. That it has been sent to me offering me a medal for my service during World War II when I was not even alive shows that the government has made what can only be described as a complete mess&mdash;a complete stuff up. Since the minister is now present, he really has to give a very serious explanation as to how he has allowed this to happen and how this is different from the treatment that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has given my colleague. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to bring to the attention of the House concerns an act of extreme bravery and courage on the part of the members of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> salvage operation, which ultimately saved Australians from a multimillion dollar oil spill clean up operation. It was an act of bravery above and beyond their normal duties that saved the coast of Western Australia from an environmental disaster, and one that has been recognised as being worthy of the Star of Courage medal for conspicuous bravery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also an act of bravery that this government has seen fit to cash in on. This government has actually taxed the money paid to these men as a reward for their bravery. On 28 July 1991 the Greek oil tanker <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> broke up in heavy seas just 30 kilometres off the coast of Western Australia near Jurien Bay. She carried a cargo of 82,000 tonnes of crude oil. Most members will be aware that this part of the coast has a worldwide significance as a marine conservation area. The area around the Ningaloo Reef has been declared a marine park to protect it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bow of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> had broken off and she had lost about 20,000 tonnes of her cargo. The decision was taken to tow the crippled tanker out to sea and to transfer the remaining cargo to the 90,000 tonne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flying Clipper</EMPHASIS> which would dock alongside her. A constituent of mine from Boyanup, Mr Kevin Hurley, was the man who made that spectacular leap in huge seas&mdash;watched by millions of TV viewers&mdash;from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tender Lady Kathleen</EMPHASIS> to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>. Mr Hurley carried a tow line which allowed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> to be towed out to sea away from the coastline and further damage. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> was so badly damaged that her cargo of oil was spilling into the ocean. She was on fire and there was every likelihood that the ship would break up and the entire 82,000 tonnes would be washed up on WA beaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had my constituent not taken that heroic leap onto the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, the outcome would have been considerably worse. Mr Hurley's actions during that rescue operation went way beyond his normal day-to-day job. His Star of Courage medal is testimony to that. He would have been quite within his rights to say, `This is too dangerous,' and no-one would have thought less of him. Naturally, when he received his reward of $28,000, Mr Hurley and his young family were delighted. They did not realise that this government would assess the $28,000 reward as income and tax him for it. The government had put its hand out for a share of the reward money. I took this matter up with the Australian Taxation Office on 15 February 1994. The Deputy Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recognised that Mr Hurley made a significant contribution to the salvage operation. However, the payment he received is remuneration for personal services rendered and is assessable income in accordance with the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA>I raised the matter with the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) and was told there is no discretion to waive the tax assessed. The Assistant Treasurer told me:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hurley is an employee of P&amp;O Maritime Services and the payment of $28,373 is clearly incidental to that employment as it represents remuneration for services rendered on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Kathleen</EMPHASIS>, the vessel on which Mr Hurley was employed.</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure the Assistant Treasurer and the House that Mr Hurley's response to that decision has been one of total outrage. Constituents have called my office and told me they simply cannot believe any government could stoop so low as to actually tax a man's bravery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message this sends out from the government is quite plain. If you carry out some brave, courageous deed for the benefit of your fellow Australians, you can expect to be taxed on any reward money. Clearly, this government places a different value on these actions. This government treats income as income&mdash;even if it is a reward for conspicuous bravery. It also puts into question the actions of our police officers, firemen and emergency services personnel, whose actions go above and beyond their normal duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer has said in regard to this case that there is no discretion to waive the tax assessed. Clearly, there is only one sensible course of action open to the government&mdash;to change the system so that the Assistant Treasurer can, at his discretion, waive the tax assessed. No-one is paid as part of his or her normal employment for acts of extreme bravery. Mr Hurley might well have said, `My life is more important than the marine environment.' But he did not, and we should all be grateful to him. We should praise his actions and encourage others to put their fellow Australians first. We should not slap a tax on their bravery. </PARA>

We're not saying you can't prosecute, but if you prosecute be aware that it's against our advice and the cost to the states will be on your head.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment briefly on the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS>. If some of its recommendations were a little stronger, the report could be called `Relaxing taxing'. That aside, it is a very important report that has come out at a very important time for the tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry in Australia is a young industry. It is in its early growth stages. That industry has the potential to provide a great deal of income to the Commonwealth of Australia in the future. I commend the report. However, I also commend the recommendation at the end of the dissenting report from the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member recommends that a comprehensive review of the indirect taxation arrangements should be undertaken to develop options for reform which address the need for simplicity, equity and efficiency. It is important that we note that recommendation in the dissenting report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know&mdash;and the government should know&mdash;that the indirect taxes levied in this country are an impediment, not only to the tourism industry, but also to a lot of other small businesses and manufacturing industries. If we are serious about helping those industries grow and about helping the development of greater employment prospects for the nearly one million people who are unemployed in Australia today, we need to pay attention to that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some good recommendations in the report. For example, recommendation No. 3 says that all vehicles which are used exclusively for earning assessable income should be fully depreciable. That is a commonsense recommendation. All the recommendations in the report, as far as I can see, are aimed at assisting the industry to get up and get going, thus generating more income for the country and generating more employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation which I highlight is recommendation No. 5. It says that net capital gains tax should be deferred on the capital gain realised on the sale of a trading business which is rolled over into another trading business. No doubt government members would be aware that that was part of our policy at the 1993 election. That ties in with part of the recommendation of the honourable member for Dawson in his dissenting report about providing fairness and equity, and incentives to continue to invest in Australia. It is a very important recommendation. I urge the government to take it on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next recommendation I had highlighted&mdash;and it goes to the heart of a bit of a problem that I have had with a couple of tourism operators in my electorate of Lyne&mdash;is recommendation No. 11, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a sales tax exemption be granted for tourism buses and four wheel drive vehicles of 12 seats and under and that the Transport Ministers Council be consulted for their assistance with the implementation of this exemption.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a terribly important recommendation and one that should be flagged to the government and indeed to the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) to act upon. The lack of exemption is causing a great deal of hardship in the tourism sector in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of years&mdash;and indeed prior to the incumbent minister taking on the portfolio&mdash;ecotourism has been promoted and developed at a very rapid rate in all parts of Australia but in particular on the eastern seaboard. It is one element of growth that we are creating, a little bit of a niche market, in my region of New South Wales. We have the advantage of being close to the coast, close to the beaches, as well as having operators such as those that I am talking about who are providing day trips or overnight trips to the hinterland, into our forests, into our national parks, using these exact vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These operators cannot get sales tax exemption unless they pay a hell of a large price for a vehicle that seats more than 12 people. Those vehicles that seat more than 12 people are not suitable for the type of job that they are doing. A couple of such operators are Richard Morocco from Port Macquarie, who had a vehicle specially built because he needed to have it under that size to operate in the forestry areas and the steep country that he goes into, and Wayne Whitford in Wingham, who is in the same predicament as he attempts to become established in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to read the particular paragraph under the heading of `Vehicles under 12 seats including small buses, courtesy buses, four wheel drive vehicles':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Buses of 13 seats or more are exempt from sales tax under a concession introduced in 1961&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is 34 years ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to allow for competition between government run transport services and those operated privately. Sales tax is imposed on vehicles of 12 seats or under, even when these vehicles are used entirely for commercial purposes. This had led to the situation where operators using larger vehicles may have a lower tax liability than their industry colleagues who use small buses, stretch limousines and 4WD vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the four-wheel drive vehicles that I am talking about. The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One operator, working within the specialist ecotourism market, described his dilemma when purchasing a new vehicle:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ideally we would have liked an 8-10 seater 4WD but found that to have any less than 13 seats we would have to pay 21% sales tax. For example, a specially made 4WD coach built by Noosa Coach and Body would cost $121 000 with 8-10 seats and only $100 000 with 13 seats!</PARA>
<PARA>It is just a ridiculous situation, and the committee noted in its report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee regards this situation as undesirable and has sought suggestions for implementing sales tax exemption on tourism vehicles where they are used to generate assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the committee came up with its very simple recommendation on exemption. In all areas of Australia these vehicles need to be specially licensed. In New South Wales people have to be specially licensed by the Roads and Traffic Authority as tourism operators and tourist bus operators. That licence should surely be the criterion for the provision of exemption from that 21 per cent sales tax, which is an added burden in establishing these businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government keeps telling us that it is all about helping small business get established. We are pouring lots of public dollars into that section of our community trying to get small businesses going through such schemes as the NEAT program, yet we are hitting people who are trying to start up a small business in the ecotourism area with a 21 per cent sales tax on their major item of capital expenditure. It is ridiculous, so I urge the government to take on board that recommendation in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other recommendation I want to discuss this morning is recommendation 21, which is in my mind a little bit soft:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in conformity with the equity criterion of good taxation, the accommodation sector not be singled out for taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is probably code for telling the government that in the 9 May budget there should be no bed tax. But the report does not come out clearly and say that, I suppose because the government members on the committee could not be so forthright as to come out and say, `No bed tax.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospect of a bed tax and the public discussion that has taken place with regard to the implementation of a bed tax in Australia in the budget in May have caused a great deal of heartburn and concern in the accommodation and tourism industries. It goes right to the heart of whether the government is really serious about developing an industry such as the tourism industry and assisting the accommodation industry to stay afloat and stay viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These industries have been belted around the ears over the last number of years since 1986-87, when the government introduced the FBT. When it was introduced, the FBT collected $535 million. In 1994-95 the FBT is expected to raise $3.23 billion&mdash;$3,230,000,000. This represents an increase of 500 per cent in nine years, and that is coming out of the productive sectors of Australia. You can argue all you like about the equity of an FBT; we believe that it should be completely reviewed. We believe that there should be a tax on non-cash remuneration, but it has gone miles too far. It has absolutely gone miles too far. There is no question that it has cost jobs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the bed tax, the prospect of a bed tax has not been ruled out. There was an interesting article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 28 March which was headed `Tourism industry relieved as bed tax fails to figure'. It seems as if that might be just a little bit of a beat-up because it was not recommended in this report that a bed tax be introduced. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry has grasped at a new parliamentary committee report for reassurance that a bed tax will not be introduced in next month's federal budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bed tax, which has the tourism industry running scared, was not recommended in the report from the House Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxing relaxing</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found no evidence of unfair taxation measures for the tourism industry, but the chairman, Mr David Simmons, said that as a young industry it was `disadvantaged by not having access to taxation benefits available to better established industries'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct. But the report still does not dispel the possibility of this government introducing a bed tax in the budget in May. I have been contacted in my electorate by all the tourism operators, and particularly the Hotels Association, who are very concerned about the prospect of that bed tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been plenty of debate about it and, if the government does go down that path, it will surely reap another backlash like it did in the Canberra by-election from that section of the community. It is again talking about taxing incentive, taxing the development of a young industry and putting more impediments in the way of the prospect of future employment in what the Minister for Tourism always promotes as one of Australia's major growth industries. We want to keep it that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to urge the government again, as has been done on numerous occasions by members from this side of the House, not to consider a bed tax. It would be a very regressive tax. I also urge the government when dealing with this report to seriously consider recommendation No. 11, that a sales tax exemption be granted for tourism buses and four-wheel drive vehicles of 12 seats and under and that the Transport Ministers Council be consulted for its assistance with the implementation of this exemption. It is a very important recommendation for the continued development of this important industry throughout Australia. I certainly hope that the minister is a little bit quicker in dealing with this report than some of his colleagues have been in dealing with a number of other reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I must say that a report that is very important to the tourism industry in Australia and, certainly, in my electorate is the Industry Commission's report on the petroleum industry, which the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has had for in excess of six months now and has not responded to. We think he has put it in the too-hard basket. It is one for which a lot of people throughout Australia, particularly in the tourism industry, are screaming out for a positive and constructive response from the government. I just hope that, when the Minister for Tourism is getting ready to respond to this report, he does it in a speedier fashion than that in which the Assistant Treasurer has dealt with the report from the Industry Commission on the petroleum industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are looking at the second report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, and it is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Native Title Tribunal Annual Report 1993-94</EMPHASIS>. The second report has been tabled more than 12 months after the tribunal began in January 1994. The tribunal has received well over 100 applications, as recorded in the annual report. During that time, seven non-claimant applications have been determined, yet in not one case has native title been declared. That has come as a tremendous blow to Aboriginal people, whose expectations were raised very much by the Native Title Act and the rhetoric that went with it. They had expectations of the awarding of native title over sections of unclaimed crown land. Yet, to date, after well over a year, there has actually been no determination in favour of Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the only determinations that have been made&mdash;seven in all&mdash;have been made in favour of non-claimants. In that situation, we might feel that perhaps it is because of the backlog of 100 or so applications in the system and that, when they go through, we may see some positive determinations on behalf of Aboriginal people. But, when we turn to the actual annual report, which this report is examining, we find this phrase by Justice French, and I think it is one that should disturb everybody. On page 3 of the annual report, Justice French says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is too early at this stage to say that the Tribunal will succeed in its objective of finding resolutions to many or any of the claims lodged with it during the reporting period.</PARA>
<PARA>Although that, at the first glance, seems to be a fairly benign statement, when one actually looks at what it means, Mr Justice French is saying that he is not optimistic that any of the claims before him will reach a resolution in favour of native title. That is very sobering and an absolute blow, as I certainly know, to the aspirations of Aboriginal people on the basis of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others have said on the advent of the Native Title Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the hundred or so applications that are still in the pipeline, we have to expect that at least another hundred will come up this year. If, in that period there have only been seven determinations, and there are a hundred applications outstanding and an estimate of a hundred more to come up this year, there will be an enormous backlog sitting there, waiting. We will understand the difficulties in resolving those determinations if we look at the claim around Kununurra, where there are over 220 claimants and non-claimants who have to go through the mediation process. It would be a nightmare to try to mediate amongst 220 different claimants and non-claimants. The record shows that there is little hope for Aboriginal people in regard to native title and that the hopes that they did have are not being met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On other matters, although the process is moving slowly, the tribunal reports that it is happy with the way that it is  running. As to the tribunal's threshold in regard to the claims process, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title found that the process is consistent with the Native Title Act. It was found that the threshold was at about the right level, that the claims are not automatically accepted, and that there has to be a clear case for those claims to be put on the agenda. The threshold is high enough to stop hopeless cases from being accepted and bogging down the tribunal's process, but also low enough to enable many claims to reach the mediation stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move to the key amendment to the Native Title Act, suggested by Justice French in the tribunal's annual report.  His proposed amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would enable an inquiry to be held, on a discretionary basis, at any point after acceptance of the application to determine whether there is a prima facie case and in that context to allow for important points of law which may affect the negotiation process to be referred to the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee considers that this is a reasonable recommendation and would support such an amendment to the act. The committee also notes that in his report Justice French said that he did not want to make any more recommendations until there was some decision from the High Court as to the validity of the Native Title Act. That validity has now been determined and we would expect that Justice French will bring forward further suggested amendments to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe that the workings of the Native Title Act are important for Aboriginal people and Aboriginal affairs, and I would like to express my disappointment that no member of the government is here to comment on this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to comment on the second report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title. The report is a relatively short one and it deals with the so-called annual report for 1993-94 of the National Native Title Tribunal. In fact, that annual report was not an annual report at all, because the tribunal was only established on 1 January 1994. It is really a report on six months of operation and even that six months of operation has to be seen in its proper context. From 1 January until 2 May there was only an interim president: the president of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was the acting president of the native title tribunal. Until even beyond the reporting date, 30 June 1994, there was no registrar; there was only an acting registrar, who, again, was the registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Justice French took office as president on 2 May, the report deals only with a period of about two months during which he was in office. The report was delivered in September; it is now relatively out of date in terms of the history of that body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost as soon as he took over, it became readily apparent to the president that there were difficulties under the legislation that needed addressing. These were picked up in the submissions made to the parliamentary joint committee, which has a statutory obligation to consider and report on the Native Title Tribunal annual reports. The committee invited submissions, took viva voce evidence and has prepared a written report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that report the committee highlights two difficulties that arise in relation to the legislation. It is to be borne in mind, in considering those matters, that the tribunal does not deal with or determine in any finite way any application for native title which is opposed or, for that matter, any application by a non-claimant which is opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal functions of the tribunal are to act as a registry for claims&mdash;that involves a formal acceptance procedure&mdash;and then to act as mediator in relation to opposed claims. The first difficulty highlighted in the report is in relation to the actual acceptance of applications. In the first instance, under section 63 of the Native Title Act, the application is dealt with by the registrar. The registrar must accept it, unless he or she is of the opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious, or that prima facie the claim cannot be made out. The provision relating to the prima facie status of the claim is in section 63(1)(b) of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the registrar is of the opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious, or that prima facie the claim cannot be made out, it is then referred to a presidential member. However, the presidential member does not apply the same test. The presidential member is directed by the legislation to consider whether a prima facie claim can be made out, so that, instead of the negative ruling that a prima facie claim could not be made out on the face of it, the presidential member proceeds to consider whether a prima facie claim can be made out. That is a cause for confusion on the part of those involved in applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue dealt with by the committee relates to events after acceptance. If an application is unopposed, then, under section 70 of the act the tribunal may make a determination along the lines sought by the applicant, if it is satisfied that the applicant has made out a prima facie case for a determination in those terms. In addition, it must be determined that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances. If the application is opposed, it then goes to mediation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before making a determination that the tribunal is satisfied as to the prima facie case, the tribunal must hold an inquiry. However, with regard to opposed applications it has no power to hold an inquiry before mediation. So it may be obliged to conduct mediation in relation to an application for which no prima facie case could be made out if the matter were examined. The president has proposed an amendment to the parliamentary joint committee that would rectify the difficulties arising in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My principal purpose in rising to speak on this matter is to highlight the situation that has arisen since the Native Title Act started to operate and, in particular, the difficulties that have been seen and commented upon by the president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Events have moved since 30 June 1994. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) pointed out, there has been no finding of native title in any case. A number of cases have been referred by the tribunal to the Federal Court but the Federal Court has not completed the hearing of any single case as yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the debate in the parliament concerning the Native Title Bill at the end of 1993, many speakers warned of the possible unworkability of the procedures that were set out in the act. They also warned the government that the time that the government anticipated it would take for the completion of applications for native title to be heard by the Federal Court and finally determined would be much longer than the government anticipated. That seems to have been borne out. We do not know how long it is going to take because as yet no claim has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 30 June 1994 we have also had the resolution of the constitutional challenge to the Native Title Act and the constitutional challenge to the Western Australian legislation. That has not in itself highlighted any particular difficulties in relation to the procedures, although one provision of the Native Title Act was held to be unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal event to occur since 30 June 1994 to which I want to draw attention is that Justice French has progressed in his understanding of the procedures under the act and has developed his thinking in relation to some of the problems that have arisen with the legislation. On 14 March 1995 he issued a discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Discussion paper on proposed changes to Native Title Act 1993</EMPHASIS>. I urge the government to give very serious consideration to what is set out in that paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice French has made a proposal which can only be regarded as fundamental in relation to the role of the tribunal. He has identified that there are significant tensions between the role of the tribunal as a decision maker, where it appears to be exercising judicial or quasi-judicial power on the one hand, and the role of the tribunal as mediator on the other hand, where it is seeking to have the parties come to an agreement rather than determining for parties what the rights and obligations are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commenting on that tension, His Honour has pointed out that the designation of the tribunal as a tribunal and the involvement of serving judges gives rise to a belief that the tribunal is a species of court which can deliver binding and conclusive decisions about the existence of native title. That is not the case at all. He says that those two matters adulterate the tribunal's role as a mediator. He points out that the role of the tribunal as a decision maker gives rise to second order litigation in relation to tribunal decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he is pointing out there is that, although the Native Title Act contemplates that the tribunal will act as a registry and as a mediator and that decisions will be made in relation to native title claims by the Federal Court, the role of the tribunal is itself subject to second order litigation in the form of judicial review of its decisions in relation to its role as a registrar and its role as a mediator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also draws attention in this paper to difficulties that arise out of the decision of Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. In that case the High Court held that the commission was purporting to exercise judicial power in breach of section 71 of the constitution in seeking to make enforcable determinations after hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gives rise to questions as to whether the Native Title Tribunal also is acting in breach of the constitution in relation to some of the decisions which are committed to it. The judge also points out that the tribunal has the unenviable task perhaps of being seen only as a place where native title claims will fail, since it has no role in relation to the finding of native title, unless there is no opposition. The usual course of events for an application before the tribunal will be that it will fail because any application that survives the prima facie claim test, in the face of opposition and in the absence of any successful mediation, will be referred to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues that are raised by Justice French in his discussion paper are very important and very serious and warrant the urgent attention of the government. Justice French sets out a process which he believes would single out the Native Title Tribunal as a mediator and eliminate the confusion of its role in relation to native title applications where it has power to make decisions. In effect, his procedure would be a court based one in which the tribunal would not act as the registry but would simply act as a mediation service. He recommends that serving judges not be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, what he proposes appears to me to have considerable merit. Any confusion of judicial roles on the one hand with administrative roles on the other hand is something that ought to be avoided not only because it is in breach of the constitution but also because when a body that is committed to making judicial determinations has other roles the parties perceive it in a different way. They do not necessarily accept that it is a body which is committed to making determinations after a contested hearing. They see it as a body which is also involved in, in this case, mediation. In other cases, it may be conciliation or arbitration or some other alternative dispute resolution mode. But it is important, I think, that public confidence in bodies which make judicial decisions be preserved to the utmost extent, and that involves keeping those bodies involved only in judicial decision making. I commend the discussion paper to the consideration of the government. </PARA>
