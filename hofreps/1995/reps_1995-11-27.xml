<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Slovenia and the 94th Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in Bucharest, October 1995. The Slovenian section of the program was lead by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). I will therefore let him make any comment on that section he would like to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 94th Inter-Parliamentary Conference was held in Bucharest between 9 and 13 October. It was an extremely well-organised conference set in the stunningly opulent Palace of Parliament, the former Ceaucescu Palace. The location of the conference in the palace underscored the contrast which is still obvious in Bucharest as Romania makes a transition to a modern and democratic society. Clearly, much has been achieved since 1989, but there are still many challenges ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased while in Romania to be able to meet with both the Presiding Officers of the Romanian parliament and with the Prime Minister. Each commented on the warmth of the existing relationship between Australia and Romania and the potential for further development, especially in trade. In particular, they noted that the Romanian government had recently approved the privatisation of around 4,000 of Romania's leading state companies, a move which in their view will provide significant opportunities for further Australian investment and joint ventures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference agenda itself is covered in detail in the report. I just comment that the supplementary item dealt with nuclear testing issues. We were pleased as a delegation to lend our support to New Zealand and Chile in putting that particular item forward for consideration as a supplementary item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the conference, the honourable member for Watson was appointed to the drafting committee charged with the difficult and very lengthy task of drafting a resolution on the supplementary topic of nuclear testing. I think it is a great tribute to his ability that the particular draft resolution that came forward was in fact carried by the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) attended the conference as a substitute member on the Committee for Human Rights of Parliamentarians. I am pleased to report to the parliament that in Bucharest he was elected to fill the Asia-Pacific vacancy on that committee and will thus continue the excellent work he has put into this committee over several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our delegation attended many meetings during the conference. They included the Asia-Pacific and 12+ groups, the Inter-Parliamentary Council, the Committee to Monitor the Situation in Cyprus and the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians. Details of all those deliberations can be found in our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the members of the delegation: the Deputy Leader, Senator Calvert, Senators Denman and Woods and the honourable members for Melbourne Ports and Watson for their commitment to the delegation's program. I also thank the delegation secretary, Peter Keele, whose assistance and genial company were greatly appreciated by us all. I also extend thanks to my personal adviser, Geraldine Skinner, for her continuing dedication to the work of the IPU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also record our appreciation of the assistance provided by Ambassadors Walker and Campbell, the Australian embassy staff in Slovenia and Romania, particularly Margaret Newman and Pam McDonald of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who accompanied us to the conference. I also thank the Parliamentary Library, the Canberra based staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and staff of the Department of Housing and Regional Development for the invaluable briefings they provided to the delegation. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few remarks regarding the visit of the delegation to Slovenia. As members might be aware, Slovenia is one of the newer countries of the world, only becoming independent from the former Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to recognise Slovenia as an independent state, doing so on 16 January 1992. That was something for which the Slovenes have always held Australia especially in their hearts, and the warmth of the people upon the visit of the Australian delegation was very pleasing to us all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that there are about 30,000 former Slovenes living in Australia at present, which shows that the ties between the two countries are more than just the economic ties that countries are generally interested in. Slovenia is a very small country, about one-third the size of Tasmania, with a population of about two million people. For Australia, it is situated at a very useful place in Europe in that the port of Koper, which is on the Adriatic, would obviously be of use for people who wish to export directly into central and eastern Europe from the Asia-Pacific region. As Slovenia arranges its transportation links to become a crossroad of Europe, that port facility I think will become much more interesting for Australian exporters who could take a couple of days off their transportation time by using that port rather than the western European ports that they now use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Slovenian government is moving down the track towards privatisation and towards integrating their economy with western Europe. They are on the way to becoming members of the European Union. In Slovenia, one gets the impression of a small country which has come to grips with independence from the old Yugoslavia and which has set itself on the road to progress. After visiting the country, one is certain that they will achieve the goal they have set themselves, that of becoming a modern European state in the middle of the new Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was very well looked after by the Slovene parliament, and we had some very good meetings with both officials and ministers of the country. I was particularly pleased to again make the acquaintance of my friend Zoran Thaler, the foreign minister of Slovenia, who assured the delegation that Slovenia would be supporting Australia's candidature for the UN Security Council. So the bonds between our two countries&mdash;and they are bonds which go both ways&mdash;are very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are increasing opportunities for trade between Australia and Slovenia, and there are even greater opportunities for trade that transits Slovenia destined for other parts of eastern and central Europe. Now that the conflict in Bosnia looks like being resolved, I think that port of Koper will become even more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just mention in passing, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Speaker remarked upon the IPU conference and our participation there. I found the drafting committee which came up with the resolution on nuclear testing to be a very interesting contest which, in the end, got down to a contest between Australia and France. The French were very well represented by M. Baumel, who is an RPR party member of the French National Assembly, who put their case strongly. I must say that M. Baumel believed very much in nuclear issues. I might conclude by reminding the parliament of something he said last Thursday in Paris when he delivered a report as the parliamentary representative of the French Defence Commission. He said he doubts that the new generation of French warheads can be perfected in the current series of underground tests and that more tests may be needed. M. Baumel, unfortunately, has learned nothing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, on the National Capital Plan&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Draft amendment No. 14 (Broadacre Areas) to the National Capital Plan</EMPHASIS>, together with the evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JF4">Mr CHYNOWETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 November 1994, the Hon. Brian Howe MP, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development and the then Deputy Prime Minister, invited the committee to inquire into, and report on, draft amendment No. 14 to the National Capital Plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Draft amendment No. 14 of the National Capital Plan seeks to expand the range of permitted land uses from the current `offensive and hazardous industries' to just the more general `industries' covering four sites identified as sites A, B, C, and D. The area under consideration lies within broadacre areas in the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of land is bounded by Oaks Estate, the ACT-NSW border, Canberra Avenue and the Molonglo River corridor. It includes the sites currently occupied by the Canberra abattoir and the Canberra tannery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee conducted a site inspection of the area covered by draft amendment No. 14 on 27 February 1995. In addition, the committee took evidence from key interested parties at public hearings on 27 February and 6 March 1995. Written submissions were also received as evidence for the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry took longer than anticipated. The investigation process raised a number of contentious issues which were debated by the committee over a considerable period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry highlighted some of the difficulties in looking at land use purposes operating under two planning regimes in the national capital. In the Australian Capital Territory both Commonwealth and ACT legislation operate and there are two `plans' known as the National Capital Plan and the Territory Plan, which are the responsibility of the National Capital Planning Authority and the ACT Planning Authority, respectively. I think it is inevitable that differences between the plans will occur. From time to time I wonder why land in the ACT has to be treated differently from land in the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason the committee received this reference was that there was an anomaly between the National Capital Plan and the Territory Plan. The National Capital Plan only permitted `hazardous and offensive industries' on the sites, while the Territory Plan permitted `industries' for all but one site within the draft amendment area. However, the Territory Plan has no effect if it is inconsistent with the National Capital Plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impetus for draft amendment No. 14 was an application by P.D. Mulligan (Holdings) Pty Ltd, the parent company of the proprietors of the Canberra abattoir, to vary its lease in the hope it could develop the site into an industrial estate of some 50 blocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Draft amendment No. 14 does not itself result in an automatic change in land use on the abattoir site as there are mandatory processes required by the ACT government before any change in land use, or any development application, can be approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Draft amendment No. 14 raised several important issues which are dealt with in detail in the report. The committee considered the extent of the area of sites A, B, C, and D proposed in draft amendment No. 14. An examination of the issues, including the amenity of nearby residents; the need for an adequate buffer zone to allow screening between any development in the area and Canberra Avenue; and the concerns of the Queanbeyan City Council. The need to reduce anomalies between the National Capital Plan and the Territory Plan led the committee to conclude that it would be more appropriate if the effect of draft amendment No. 14 was confined to sites A, B and D, thereby excluding site C. Consequently, the committee recommends that draft amendment No. 14, as originally proposed, not be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the committee recommends that the National Capital Plan's range of permitted land use be expanded to permit industry on sites A, B and D, the details of which are given in the report, and that any industry proposed be subject to environmental assessment. This recommendation is conditional on a number of undertakings being fulfilled, and these undertakings are outlined in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that site C not be used for industry but permits the normal range of non-special uses for broadacre areas in the National Capital Plan. In conclusion, I wish to thank the committee members for their participation in the committee's deliberations. I particularly thank the secretariat and those people who worked on this very complex issue. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all those who gave evidence to this inquiry in submissions and those who also gave evidence at public hearings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though there was some dispute in this inquiry on the National Capital Plan, the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories nevertheless continues to work harmoniously in its processes. There is a dissenting report from this inquiry, as the chair, the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth), has said. Five of the members signed the dissenting report, and that is unusual. The issue in the inquiry was really about the process through which planning should take place in the ACT. Those who signed the dissenting report considered that the process should involve, in this case, deciding on the needs for industrial land and deciding where in the city industrial estates should be best located and then planning it properly. That is not what happened in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case an abattoir owner decided that he wanted to move his abattoir elsewhere and, in order to make as much out of the land that he occupied as possible, asked for permission to redevelop that land as an industrial estate. If he had received the agreement he had been seeking, he would have been driving the process of industrial development in the ACT at his own convenience rather than in terms of the best planning process and the best characteristics of the location for an industrial estate in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the dissenting members considered that inadequate evidence had been given to judge whether this was the best location for an industrial estate, that it was therefore inappropriate to give approval for this application and that the land should have been returned to the ACT government for it to then consider what the appropriate use should be. In a very carefully worded dissent, we said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While recognising that there would be risks in its proposed investment as a developer, and acknowledging that betterment would be payable to the ACT Government, there is no justification for the present lessee potentially to profit from such a substantial change of use&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as he was proposing or requesting&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">nor for it automatically to become the developer of what would be effectively a new industrial suburb without competing for that right.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a question of the balance of return to an individual lessee as against the whole community and also about the role for individual initiative as against the proper planning process in the interests of the whole community of the territory and in this case the surrounding town of Queanbeyan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We therefore oppose the recommendation in its original form, or its amended form, and propose that the land be returned to the ACT government. If there were a need for an additional industrial estate&mdash;about which quite insufficient evidence was given to the committee&mdash;then the ACT government could respond to that in the appropriate way. In conclusion, I would like to thank the chair for his effective role in this quite difficult inquiry, the committee secretariat and, in particular, the committee secretary, Meg Crooks, for her very impartial handling of this inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House for this opportunity to speak on the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Draft amendment No. 14 (Broadacre Areas) to the National Capital Plan</EMPHASIS>. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has recommended that the original draft amendment not be agreed to. The committee has taken great care in its deliberations to ensure that the residents of Oaks Estate were protected from both environmental degradation and various pollutants, such as noise and odours, which are common hazards of industrial sites and also to ensure that there is a buffer zone, which is marked C on the maps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also noted that the process by which draft amendment No. 14 was conceived and developed raises some questions about land use and planning in the ACT and some of the ad hoc nature of how that goes about. Indeed, before the Joint Committee on Public Works at this very moment are other works that highlight the process that faces the development of Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that in mind, I am pleased that the ACT government and the Commonwealth have established the metropolitan Canberra growth strategy review to see whether some of these dilemmas that led to the dissenting report can be ironed out. As the chair of the committee, the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) has said, the time spent on this report indicates the difficulties that the committee experienced. Hopefully, the new review will overcome some of those anomalies and difficulties. But before this process even continues the applicant will now have to become involved in the ACT planning process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the broad range of uses permitted in broadacre areas in the National Capital Plan be amended. It wants to limit an expanded range of permitted industry to sites A, B and D only, on the land to the west of Oaks Estate on the north side of Canberra Avenue and to ensure that industry proposed for sites A, B and D is subject to environmental assessment and is all conditional on the undertakings put before it. The committee has also recommended that all industry, including hazardous or offensive industry, not be permitted on site C but that the normal range of non-special area uses for broadacre areas in the National Capital Plan be permitted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, I present the committee's report on limitation on institution of criminal proceedings under section 1316 of the Corporations Law, together with the evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V5">Mr STEPHEN SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the tasks of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities since its formation in 1991 has been monitoring the investigation and prosecution of breaches of corporate law in the 1980s, with a particular concern about delay in resolving these matters. These events and the investigations resulting from them are now up to eight years old, with a number still to be brought before the courts. For example, the decision of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), pursuant to section 1316 of the Corporations Law, to consent to the commencement of proceedings against Mr Bond, Mr Oates and Mr Mitchell in relation to a Bell Resources matter is a reminder that matters of great complexity requiring very considerable application of the resources of the Australian Securities Commission, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts are still to be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1993, the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Alan Cameron, commented publicly that `Section 1316 of the Corporations Law may impede the prosecution of corporate crime, particularly in complex cases'. The committee raised this issue with Mr Cameron when he appeared before a public hearing of the committee in April 1994. Mr Cameron said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulty is that any such decision is itself capable of being reviewed  . . . The only thing that is certain is that an aggressive defendant's first ploy will be to tie us up, potentially for years, in administrative review of the Attorney-General's decision to extend the time. That is the reason we are not sure why there needs to be a special rule for corporate crime.</PARA>
<PARA>Options considered by the committee in its inquiry included: repealing the present limitation period in relation to indictable offences; increasing the limitation period from five to seven years or retaining the Attorney-General's discretion, with the removal of any right of review of the exercise of the discretion; or no change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence before the committee focused on the distinction between indictable offences, subject to no general limitation period under the Crimes Act 1914, and summary offences, which are subject to a 12-month limitation period under the Crimes Act. Arguments favouring the abolition of the Attorney-General's consent were that it will put corporate criminal prosecutions on the same basis as the general criminal law and it is not an appropriate role for the Attorney-General under the current independent prosecution process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arguments advanced advocating retention of section 1316 stressed that the limitation period should apply to indictable offences under the Corporations Law as limitations in general act as a discipline on agencies to ensure expeditious investigatory and prosecution processes. The committee found that there should be no limitation period for serious or indictable offences under the Corporations Law and that section 1316 of the Corporations Law should be amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of summary offences, the committee decided that these offences should be subject to a limitation period of five years but without any capacity on the part of the Attorney-General to extend. The committee found that the Crimes Act limitation period of 12 months would not allow proper investigation of summary offences under the Corporations Law, some of which involve quite serious breaches of corporate behaviour. I draw the House's attention to the opinion tabled in respect of this matter by Senator Cooney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central point in the submissions advocating retention of the limitation period and the discretion in the Attorney-General was that such a discretion provided enhanced accountability for the exercise of the already wide powers of the ASC and the DPP. Contrary arguments to the committee stressed two important points of accountability: judicial or administrative review of a prosecution decision and the courts limiting the commencement of prosecutions due to abuse of process. Recent decisions indicate that suspect proceedings will not easily escape the court's scrutiny. The committee does not agree that the addition of a discretion in the Attorney-General to allow an extended period of prosecution will enhance this protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that the current discretion of the Attorney-General does not significantly add to the proper and desirable level of protection of persons accused under various provisions of the Corporations Law. As well, since the creation of the office of the DPP&mdash;a statutory independent prosecuting authority&mdash;it would be anomalous for the Attorney-General to retain an effective prosecutorial discretion such as that currently contained in section 1316. The committee believes that serious corporate criminal offences should be placed on the same basis as serious general criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee does, however, believe that the DPP and the ASC should include extra information in their annual reports to provide some better information on the DPP's decisions in relation to corporate offences. The committee is concerned that in future a clear picture be presented each year of the number of current matters in the hands of the DPP, the time that has elapsed since the alleged commission of offences that may be involved in each matter, and the state each matter has reached in the investigation, assessment and prosecution process. The committee believes that such a picture will allow the responsible minister and the parliament to better ensure that there is appropriate public information on the ASC's and the DPP's administration of this area of their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has formally recommended in its report that future annual reports of the Australian Securities Commission and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions provide detailed information showing the time that has elapsed since the commission of alleged offences under the Corporations Law and the time that has elapsed since the commencement of active investigative and prosecutorial processes. I commend the report to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report on limitation on institution of criminal proceedings under section 1316 of the Corporations Law of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities just tabled by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has my endorsement. I want to comment on several aspects of the report. Firstly, it is important that people understand that the aftermath of all the disasters of the entrepreneurs of the 1980s should not generate an undue legislative response from this parliament, nor should it create the expectation that every company dealing is illegal or improper. When this reference was first given to the committee I was concerned that this was just another instance of the ASC attempting to extend jurisdiction in a way which was going to prejudice the proper functioning of the marketplace and, in particular, of companies in the Australian financial structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am convinced that that is not so. My own view had been that the period of five years within which the ASC should initiate proceedings should be retained, basically because I felt that for both summary and indictable offences it was necessary for a party at arms length to ensure that every attempt had been made by the ASC to initiate proceedings as soon as possible. Having heard the evidence and having considered the matter, however, I concur with the conclusions of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been only four years since the Director of Public Prosecutions, the DPP, has taken over from the Attorney-General responsibility for prosecutions. I believe that the manner of assessment by the DPP replaces the role previously exercised in the prosecution sense by the Attorney-General. Accordingly, I accept the fact that this is an appropriate deletion. Therefore, the committee's recommendation that there should no longer be a necessity for the minister, or the Attorney-General in this instance, to give approval after five years should be proceeded with. That is the recommendation of both the DPP and the ASC. For that reason, I think there is now a better practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the dissenting report of Senator Cooney. I do not agree with that because I believe it is difficult for summary offences to be prosecuted at too early a stage. The committee report stated that there would still be a time within which it would be possible for summary offences to be prosecuted and be retained but that they be removed altogether for indictable offences. I believe it is appropriate that the indictable offence removal be proceeded with. At the same time, I suggest that the DPP has a responsibility to ensure that the normal procedures and practices regarding the reasonableness of prosecution be considered very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My worry has been, and it is a fact that was presented in evidence to the committee, that after seven years it is no longer necessary to keep records. While there have been a number of incredible abuses of proper accounting and prudential responsibility by a number of corporate figures, that does not mean that all have done so. It would be unreasonable if a prosecution were initiated against a person simply on the basis that time has lapsed, prosecution was not commenced at a reasonable time and records had been destroyed. I think that seven-year period within which people are required to keep records needs to be kept in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time I think the five-year limitation for summary offences is reasonable. For that reason I believe it is appropriate for it to be retained, as the committee has recommended. Its removal altogether does not mean that unlimited time will be available. It means that in any instance where the ASC recommends prosecution the officers of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be available to supervise the exercise of that prosecution. I believe in that instance the report makes sense. For that reason, I support the recommendations of the committee and commend the chairman and the members of the secretariat for the work they have undertaken in the preparation of this report. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS> was tabled in April 1992. It highlighted the benefits that could be achieved if Australian firms better coordinated their services along the transport chain to the waterfront. It revealed an `appalling apathy, ignorance and inertia on the part of users of waterfront services'. Three and a half years on there has been little change, although we have seen improvements in some areas, with some service providers having shown a willingness to improve communication and coordination between parties operating at the port interface. Outdated financial, documentary and logistic practices are continuing impediments to Australian products becoming more competitive abroad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Waterfront productivity is important, yet efficient use of transport services to the waterfront is even more important to exporters, importers, and Australia's international competitiveness. Service providers and their customers need to develop a team approach to maximising the productivity and efficiency of port related services. The committee is convinced that much greater progress would have been made if the interface efficiency councils, recommended in the 1992 report, had been established at all of Australia's major ports. Accordingly, the committee has again recommended they be established in all major ports to facilitate the efficient movement of cargo to and from the waterfront and to ensure effective communication and coordination at the port interface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to electronic data interchange. The national consultative group has been successful in developing a common approach to the promotion of electronic commerce in the transport industry. However, a significant impediment to the use of electronic commerce by small business in all industries as well as the transport sector has been the availability of cost-effective electronic data interchange software. The committee has recommended that the Commonwealth government, through the Department of Industry, Science and Technology, fund a detailed assessment of the current environment for software development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport costs to the wharf are not a priority for small exporters. However, taken together, they constitute a major factor in improving Australia's international competitiveness. By focusing public debate solely on the waterfront, industry associations, governments and politicians mask the many problems which remain in the transport chain to the wharf. This is a lazy and obstructive approach to a difficult and complex logistics problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the deputy chairman, Mr Stewart McArthur, and my fellow committee members for their cooperation in the conduct of this inquiry. I thank also the committee secretariat, including the secretary, Mr Malcolm Aldons; Mr Les Dunn; and administrative officer, Mrs June Murphy. Special thanks are due to Mr John Jenkins, consultant, and Mr Robert Tranter of the Department of Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the report in respect of oil spills. Given the adverse effect of oil spills on the marine environment and the significant public interest in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, the committee welcomed the opportunity to review the report of the Auditor-General: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Is Australia ready to respond to a major oil spill?</EMPHASIS> Our work complements the committee's work earlier on ship safety. Pollution of the sea by oil is a major world problem. Given Australia's 37,000 kilometres of coastline, and our diverse marine environment, the threat of an oil spoil is particularly significant. Thus, it is essential that Australia has an adequately resourced oil spill prevention strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit report focused on the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's management of a national oil plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil. The committee notes that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority has agreed to 15 of the 18 recommendations in the Auditor's report. The committee adjudicated on those areas of disagreement. The key feature of an oil spill strategy is prevention. Fundamental to prevention is crew competency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned in the committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, human factors are the principal cause of shipping incidents and accidents. Public and media attention focuses too often on isolated tanker collisions, ruptures and spillages. Tanker accidents, however, account for only 12 per cent of oil pollution of the marine environment. General vessel operations account for 33 per cent and industrial discharge and urban run-off account for 37 per cent. The committee is concerned that insufficient attention is given to other marine pollutants such as hazardous and noxious substances. Many chemicals transported by sea present greater danger to people and to the environment than crude oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made four recommendations relating to the development of shore line clean-up standards, crew competency, oil sampling practices and risk assessment. The port of Newcastle is the only authority in Australia which collects samples of ships' oil. The Newcastle program is intended to raise awareness about the impact on the environment of marine pollution and to gather oil samples as potential evidence which in the case of prosecution may become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the port of Newcastle commenced collecting samples of on board fuel and bilge oil from ships in harbour, there has been a marked decrease in pollution incidents. The committee recommended that the national plan advisory committee, as a matter of urgency, request that all its members introduce oil sampling practices similar to those in operation in Newcastle. The grounding of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS>, resulting in a spillage of 350 tonnes of fuel oil, occurred during the review. Due to time limitations and inquiries that are under way elsewhere, only brief reference has been made to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS> in this report. It is a matter that should be examined more closely by this committee in the next parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's interim assessment suggests that the risk assessment criteria underrated the navigational difficulty in the River Tamar area of the Tasmanian coast where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Iron Baron</EMPHASIS> came to grief. In conclusion, I thank the deputy chairman, Mr Stewart McArthur, and my fellow committee members for their cooperation and support in the conduct of this inquiry. I also thank the committee secretariat, including the secretary, Mr Malcolm Aldons; the inquiry secretary, Mr Stephen Boyd; and the administrative officers, Mrs June Murphy and Mrs Sue Cox, for their dedicated efforts in the production of this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a few words to those in the two reports just tabled by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. As the chairman has so rightly said, little has changed on the waterfront since we reported a couple of years ago. There is too much blaming others on the waterfront. Everyone seems to be protecting their own bailiwick. It is all very well to blame one sector but it is not as if there is one entity; it is a whole conglomerate. There is a chain&mdash;and every link plays an important part. We have found too often that, on the waterfront, everyone blames the other person or the other group instead of looking at themselves. Until we can realistically come to grips with that and look at the whole of the waterfront&mdash;not just sectional interests&mdash;we are not going to make great strides towards the reforms that we all want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to oil spills, in which I have a particular interest. Being an island continent, it is very important that we protect our coastline. People think that when oil spills occur it is always great tankers that have come to grief. As the chairman of the committee has said, it concerns such things as urban run-off and spillage from ships. In my own electorate of Throsby, at Shellharbour a coastal ship carrying blue metal from Bass Point to Sydney two or three weeks ago ran aground through, I believe, crew incompetence&mdash;although I suppose I will get the usual angry letters for saying that. Had the wind not changed dramatically when it did, the ship would have broken on the rocks. There would have been an oil spill for many miles along the beaches of the south coast. We are finding increasingly that, with the number of vessels coming onto the Australian coastline, the competence of the crew is an important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was horrified to hear on the ABC news just this morning as I was driving to Canberra that a Korean ship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Star</EMPHASIS>, went through the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) would be well aware of the necessity to protect that pristine area&mdash;without a pilot when there is compulsory pilotage in that region. It was a sugar ship&mdash;and the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) can give you some examples of sugar ships that he has dealt with recently. This ship is under arrest in Cairns at the moment. Interestingly, no-one quite knows who owns the sugar. I think it is split up between 11 people. It is quite amazing. The captain decided to go through that area without a pilot&mdash;even though there is compulsory pilotage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hear from the unions&mdash;they are contacting me again later today&mdash;that there is a question about crew wages. How many times do we on the committee hear that story. There are underpaid, underfed and physically abused crews on these ships. It all comes down to the question of crew competence. It is time that we looked at the competence of some of the crews that are coming to Australia. Our coastline is at risk. Despite recent changes to the law, the final person who will pay for the clean-up to the Australian coastline when it is polluted with dirty, greasy oil is the Australian taxpayer. We will be paying for it. I hope that the captain of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Star</EMPHASIS> is fined severely and put in gaol and that this nonsense will stop. I commend the report.

<PARA>In all the discussions of the effects and consequences of privatisation its effect on the individual lives and communities of rural Australians has been totally overlooked. That also applies to the effect on individual lives in communities of rural Victoria following the introduction and doubling of the number of electronic gaming machines in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social policies since 1945 combined with other features like population mobility and economic and technological factors more generally have all improved the status of rural people. Whilst there is a convergence of the needs of rural and metropolitan people, and similarities concerning disadvantage such as poverty and isolation, rural disadvantage is found across a number of social, economic and service indices compared with urban Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These disadvantages include higher poverty and unemployment levels in rural Australia, more extensive mortality and morbidity rates&mdash;for example, the VFF has claimed that children on farms are three times more likely to die from an accident than their city counterparts&mdash;higher price levels in the country, reduced educational and occupational attainment and expectations, and reduced access to health and welfare services. They also must face additional factors such as flood, fire, drought and extremes of temperature sometimes destroying both life and means of livelihood, yet the Victorian government is totally ignoring the needs of rural Victorians and rural business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The divisions between people, wealth and decision makers mirror the division between cities and rural Australia. Australia's cities have provided ideal locations for capital&mdash;that is, population size, communications for infrastructure, transport, markets, consumers and labour but there has been no serious attempt since the 1970s to tackle regional development. Meanwhile, the rural sector has been in long-term relative decline&mdash;farming and small towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1995 the National Rural Outlook Conference heard that farmers of beef, sheep, wool and wheat could not expect to increase their resource base. Condliffe states that the number of farmers fell by 15,000 in the 15 years to 1989, the farm work force by 32,000 and the total rural work force by 100,000. Lawrence predicted that 45,000 farmers would leave the land in the decade following 1987. Condliffe argues that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the increasing rationalisation and privatisation of government services to country towns further emphasises the decline of employment opportunities, and furthers the exodus to the cities. Many rural towns rely upon such services not only for the jobs provided but the income input into the local economy.

<PARA>It is also argued that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . new technologies, in communications, rationalisation of the transport industry, and continued decline of manufacturing further exacerbates the plight of these communitie.</PARA>
<PARA>The Evatt Research Centre has found that the pivotal role of the public sector as a major employer in rural Australia `is increasingly no longer the case'. Given that in rural towns the public sector was the largest employer, traditionally providing stability through seasonal and other variations in the local economy, the effect of privatisation can be disturbing for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Communities are hit twice when the employment opportunities as well as the services are privatised and rationalised away from local control. On the question of privatisation of electricity, there is no definitive answer as to whether the service will be cheaper. In fact rural community rating in Victoria is to be abolished, effective from the year 2000. In some overseas cases it has become more expensive to the consumers while a minority of executives and captains of industry realise increasing wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what is happening in Victoria. The top end of town is doing very well. If you are a mate of Kennett, a mate of the Liberal Party, you get appointed to all the boards, you get appointed to run the amalgamated councils and you get increased licences to run bigger casinos&mdash;more poker machines and more gaming machines&mdash;without inquiry, without examination, while in rural Victoria, in the rural areas I represent, devastation is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if you look at my own electorate you will see that the area around Lake Eildon is well known in Australia. It is at the foothills of the southern alps. It is well known for tourism and is a very diversified farming area. If you take the towns of Mansfield, Eildon, Alexandra and Yea, you will find that in the last two years over 100 public sector jobs have gone. They have gone from the state Rivers and Water Supply Commission, from the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, from Vic Roads and from education. They have gone from every Victorian public sector; they have vanished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some 50 houses now for sale in Eildon. You cannot sell a house there. I was in Alexandra a week ago and five businesses were closing in the main street there. Small businesses in Yea despair. This is the direct result of the Kennett government. This is a direct result of a lack of concern and a lack of care for small rural communities, and it is fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will hear opposition members get up and support Kennett. They have never been to a country town and talked to the people there. They have never been there and have not spoken to people. They will not deny that 68,000 jobs in the public sector have gone from Victoria. With the amalgamation of local government in Victoria, it is now estimated that a further 10,000 jobs are going to vanish. That is devastating, but on top of that devastation caused by the so-called economic rationalism&mdash;I call it economic stupidity&mdash;we now have in Victoria a doubling of the number of electronic gaming machines&mdash;a doubling, without any examination or inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you talk to people in small business in rural areas, they will tell you what is happening. About 13 per cent of a family's spending is called discretionary spending.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria it has been a double whammy for country towns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Projects such as the Ballarat University technology park have been actively pursued by the state government. That is the Kennett Victorian state government, I tell the honourable member for McEwen. They generate jobs in rural Victoria during the construction stages and offer employment in the long term for rural graduates from our regional universities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the change of government in Victoria in October 1992, we have seen a real change in the outlook of many Victorians. This is particularly evident in the area of small business. The member for McEwen reckons we are losing small businesses rapidly. The facts are that 12,000 new small businesses have been started in Victoria since October 1992 across all business sectors&mdash;from manufacturing and processing to services ranging in size from a large plant or factory to the small corner shop. Thirty thousand new jobs have been created in small business in Victoria since October 1992. There are now close to 210,000 small businesses in Victoria&mdash;some 96 per cent of all enterprises, employing 760,000 Victorians and making up over 50 per cent of the private sector work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian government is continuing its program of cutting red tape for small business&mdash;something the federal government could well take as an example. Some 450 regulations were repealed or sunsetted in 1993, while the rate of new regulation making is at its lowest level since the 1960s. Small Business Victoria handles around 70,000 inquiries a year, and it is focused on facilitating service delivery to ensure optimal service to small business operators throughout Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important point that needs to be made is that the Yellow Pages small business health index published in May of this year showed overwhelming support by small business for the Kennett government&mdash;a point that the honourable member for McEwen and the honourable member for Dunkley constantly miss. Sixty-five per cent of small businesses believe that the coalition can best look after their interests; only five per cent believe the ALP would do the right job for small business. In Victoria, the coalition is ranked ahead of the ALP on all factors&mdash;including handling the state economy overall, 80 per cent; reducing unemployment, 61 per cent; minimising strikes, 43 per cent; workplace reform, 73 per cent; reducing taxes and charges, 42 per cent and reducing red tape, 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Yellow Pages survey went on to show that nearly six out of 10 of the small businesses surveyed believe the federal Labor government's economic policies work against the interests of small business. Got that? Federal government policies, the policies this mob over there do not want you to know about, work against the interests of small business. This includes taxes, bureaucracy, lack of incentives, lack of understanding of the needs of small business, industrial relations policies including unfair dismissal policies, government charges and superannuation policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the latest Yellow Pages survey released at the end of August, Victorian&mdash;and South Australian&mdash;small businesses lead the nation in confidence about their prospects for the next 12 months.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Walker essentially says that the government's reforms and purchasing policy still have not got around to doing the job for small business. We brought down this report some 18 months ago, and we made major recommendations in this House of Representatives that the government should do something about controlling its 30,000 employees who place orders for government business&mdash;at least $10 million worth of purchasing by the federal government. Something like 13,000 government credit cards float around all over the place, and we expect small and medium sized businesses to try to get their fair share of government business. It does not work. It is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study found that locating the right buyer for goods and services was the single most important barrier to almost one-fifth of all small and medium sized business enterprises.

They remember the example of the librarian who had her wages cut by over $10,000 by the policies of this state government.

<PARA>One of my constituents, a man called Kevin Moran, died on Friday, 12 May 1995. Kevin was a good man and a family man. I just want to quote briefly from a letter written by his widow two days later, on 14 May. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After losing one son to this road, we were stunned. Then when Roberts bus was hit by a semi, we were shattered, but honestly . . . I don't know what I am now&mdash;I can't feel, I can't think, I don't want to live, my family have lost their Dad. I have lost my best friend, my mate of 35 years, and the only person I have ever loved&mdash;all because no-one will make a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pleaded, I have begged, I have prayed, I have done everything possible to get this road underway . . . but it has obviously been to no avail, and now I have to suffer a life of solitude, of grieving, of aching loneliness . . . Something has got to be done . . . before someone else is killed&mdash;surely two, and almost three, from one family is enough.</PARA>
<PARA>I grieve for Mrs Moran and her family. This is what we are talking about when we talk about the Pacific Highway. We are talking about death, mayhem, slaughter, grief and an enormous cost to the society of Australia; not just in pain and suffering, but in money. The cost-benefit ratio of building a new Pacific Highway makes it far cheaper to build a new highway than to pay for the deaths and the suffering. I am reminded that very soon&mdash;22 December&mdash;we have the anniversary of the Clybucca bus smash in my electorate where 35 people died. It was Australia's worst disaster. I see the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) sitting in the chamber. A couple of months before that smash, in his electorate near the little village of Cowper, 20 people died on a bus. In actual fact, the number of people who have died on the Pacific Highway between 1985 and 1994 is 766. There were 10,000 casualties&mdash;10,000 smashed, maimed and battered bodies. It is not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we approach Christmas 1995, let's pray that there are no more bus smashes&mdash;but, unfortunately, there will be deaths. I was interested to see the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> segment last night on which Richard Carleton spoke with Kevin Waller, the former Chief Coroner of New South Wales, who conducted coronial inquiries into both bus smashes. He was talking about the federal minister for roads, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Mr Brereton, I would just ask you to seriously get down to work to start planning this dual construction and to give the motorists something that they've deserved, I think, for the past 20 or 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Another point made in that program was that a painted line is not good enough for separating traffic. It is absolutely true. We have to have a four-lane dual carriageway, a divided highway all the way from Hexham to the Queensland border. All the evidence from around Australia and from right around the world shows, without any doubt, that once you put in a divided highway the number of accidents diminishes and the number of fatalities goes down by as much as 80 per cent. These are not just idle figures. These are the statistics of the RTA and the various other state bodies around Australia and throughout the world. Put in a divided highway and cut out the deaths. That is what we have to do on the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highway serves a population of about 500,000. But that is just the local population. The reality is that, with a traffic level of 37,000 vehicles a day, an enormous number of people from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Geelong also use the highway. I am not making a plea for the local people of the north coast but for all of Australia. This is one of the major traffic arteries of Australia. It connects the two largest cities in Australia. It serves the fastest growing area of Australia. It is the transportation backbone of the east coast of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is huge potential along the length of that highway for major industries such as tourism. Getting the right road will assist everybody. If these industries are to succeed, it will be economically beneficial for the whole of Australia, not just the people of the north coast. We should not forget that the 2000 Olympics are just around the corner. With people travelling from Sydney to the Gold Coast, the amount of traffic on the highway will increase dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the present Labor government&mdash;I am going to be political; I am sure that the member for Page and his colleagues will attack me&mdash;has abandoned the Pacific Highway. There is no doubt about that. For a while, they did the right thing. I will give you a very brief history of what has happened with the Pacific Highway and the campaign for a new one. Before I was first elected in 1984, I started the campaign for a new Pacific Highway. People said that I was stupid and an idiot. They said that I would never get a four-lane highway there and that it was pie in the sky. How wrong they were, because we are going to get it. We have had a little. The reality is that we must get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After those unfortunate bus smashes, the people of Australia got right behind the Pacific Highway. In 1990, I was able to present something like 50,000 signatures on petitions to this parliament from people right around Australia. They said, `Please give the Pacific Highway some priority.' I was able to convince first the National Party of the need for priority funding and then our Liberal friends. When we went into the 1990 election, we had a firm coalition policy, in conjunction with the then coalition government of New South Wales, to provide additional funding. We did, and it did happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a program that said that the highway would get an additional $300 million. An amount of $130 million was to come from the federal government and $170 million was to come from the state government. Thank goodness the Labor government took up the challenge. They matched our offer. The reality is that $300 million was spent between 1990 and 1993. The few kilometres of divided highway that we now have are a result of that extra $300 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I praise the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who was the Minister for Transport, and a darned good one. He put the money into the Pacific Highway. Unfortunately, he left the ministry, and that was it. It was finished. The black spots program went right out the door. That was the most efficient use of funding that this country has ever seen. People want it back. Labor abolished the black spots program. I am very pleased to say that, while the details of everything have not been announced and will not be until the election, the coalition has promised to reintroduce the black spots program. It is a good promise. After 1993, no more funding went directly to the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All sorts of organisations on the north coast have created a task force. There is a meeting of it in the next few weeks. We met in Ballina about a year ago. We were all very happy and bipartisan, but nothing happened. I say to the member for Page&mdash;he will have a chance in a minute to refute this&mdash;that he says things in the electorate but, when he comes down here, as in the forestry industry debate, he votes on the party line. I challenge the member for Page to say that he will pressure his government, going into the next election, to provide priority funding for the Pacific Highway and to reinstate the black spots program. We do not want any more deaths. There have been far too many. I for one have had a gutful of people dying on that highway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can only be with the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) on this subject of the deaths on the roads, particularly those on the Pacific Highway as he mentioned. Back in 1989 and 1990 we had some particularly bad bus crashes resulting in the deaths of many people. I too have known people who have been killed on the Pacific Highway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My great fear is that, as we approach the year 2000, unless there is some serious and rapid upgrading of that road, along with the greater volumes of traffic on that highway, including more buses particularly in that period before the Olympics, we will see more of those dreadful bus crashes that occurred a few years ago. I think the answer to this problem is that the Pacific Highway does need to become part of the national highway system. It does need additional funding to accelerate the work being done on it. We need to be serious about this, and we do not need to raise people's hopes falsely. I notice paragraph (4) of the motion moved by the member for Cowper says `endorses the need for special priority funding for the Pacific Highway'. I support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to a couple of instances that occurred recently in my electorate which have led me to doubt the sincerity of the opposition on this matter. The shadow minister for transport was in my electorate recently and he announced that the coalition would have a new category of roads called roads of national importance. He said the Summerland Way was one of those roads of national importance and that he would provide, if elected, $38 million towards upgrading it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when questioned by the Lismore <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Echo</EMPHASIS> he said the funding would be sought on a fifty-fifty basis with the state government to achieve the figure of $38 million to be spent over a period of five to six years. The new New South Wales government has already promised $50 million over that period and this year is spending over $6 million on the Summerland Way, far in excess of what was spent under a coalition government. Even on that basis it is a funny sort of promise, but when you look at some of the policy documents that have come into our hands you can understand why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy document headed `Structural reform management group: regional and rural development' has the name Bruce Scott, shadow minister for regional and rural development, at the bottom. When talking about infrastructure on this policy document he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to set a figure ($1 billion, $3 billion&mdash;the actual number is insignificant) as an indication of our commitment to putting roads, dams, port, airports, bridges, whatever, into regional Australia. We should also then allude to some sort of assessment procedure by which regions can directly seek funding . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In a further document, a briefing paper to shadow cabinet, when talking about infrastructure the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with proposals in infrastructure is how to give us the flexibility to campaign properly without being so specific as to lock us into particular projects which then of necessity must rule out others.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This gives us the flexibility of announcing a lot of major long term visionary matters but without committing ourselves to actually proceeding with them.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the members opposite, when talking about the Pacific Highway and country roads, not to raise those hopes and tell people we are going to do something when we have these sorts of documents which are hypocritical in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Cowper was, of course, right in saying that the federal government no longer puts money directly into the Pacific Highway. We had the provincial cities and rural highways program from 1990 to 1993, which put $300 million into the Pacific Highway. That was discontinued as a result of the 1991 Premiers Conference, in which it was resolved to more clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each level of government for funding of both maintenance and improvements. That agreement was signed&mdash;in other words, agreed to&mdash;by the New South Wales government. That government at the time was a coalition government. The agreement reinforced the historical links between the New South Wales government and its commitment to the Pacific Highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government agreed, as part of that agreement, to fully fund improvement works for the highway as it had always done. In the five years leading up to this year, the average spent by the state government&mdash;that is, the coalition government&mdash;on the Pacific Highway was $74 million a year. This year, under a New South Wales Labor government, the figure was in excess of $100 million. It is still not enough. Still we need more improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the quandary of the member for Cowper. In paragraph (4) of the motion he moves that the House `endorses the need for special priority funding for the Pacific Highway'. The question is how we get it. It is, by the agreement I have mentioned, a state government responsibility. There is no doubt about that. The money that the federal government was putting in as part of that agreement was paid to the states in an untied way. In excess of $100 million per annum was provided to cover both the black spots program and the provincial cities and rural highways program. As part of that, we took into the national highway system the Newell and Sturt highways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the agreement, the Pacific Highway stays part of the state responsibility. It is unlikely, under present circumstances, that the federal government will step in. We have a hullabaloo from the opposition about roads of national importance. I do not know if the Pacific Highway will also be made part of the roads of national importance program, but it is worth noting&mdash;and it shows real hypocrisy&mdash;that, when the member for Hume (Mr Sharp) was asked about where these roads of national importance would be, he said, `Obviously, they would focus on marginal electorates.' That is a rather cynical view when you are talking about deaths and trauma on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no free rides as far as funding goes. The answer is for negotiations to go on between the New South Wales government, the Queensland government and the federal government, with the aim of making the Pacific Highway part of the national highway system, with a long-term plan&mdash;though as short-term as possible&mdash;to improve it to a state where it can take the sort of traffic that it is receiving at the moment and will do in increasing loads in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, I support the motion, but I would ask the member for Cowper and other members, when they are talking about these issues, to try to be factual about them and to look at the issues involved. As I say, I can understand the member for Cowper's quandary because it is difficult for him to propose the Pacific Highway as part of the national highway system&mdash;though he did in the past&mdash;because he recognises that on his side of parliament it is more than likely politically unachievable because it would mean the dropping of the New England Highway as part of the national highway system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address this motion today having had a look through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record, so I know it seems to be somewhat of an annual visit that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) makes to this issue. I can tell you what will not appear in the Taree <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> or the Coffs Harbour <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clarion</EMPHASIS>, and that is that the Carr government has increased funding on the Pacific Highway by 36 per cent. That will definitely not appear in any of your papers because you would not dare tell people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You come here and criticise the federal government for not funding a state road that was declared in 1974. The agreement between the then Askin government and the federal government under Gough Whitlam was that the Pacific Highway would be a state road. When the Carr government came in, we immediately saw an increase in funding. That is the commitment of the Australian Labor Party to the Pacific Highway. I think you gentlemen would be wise not to forget it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to talk about facts, maybe you should go back to the fact that grants became untied last year. This is the first time in history that grants have not been tied to a specific purpose. What did we see the then Fahey government do with the first $50 million given to that state for road funding? We saw them spend it on City Rail. As much as there is a demand by the people on the north coast for increased funding on the Pacific Highway, the Fahey government took the first $50 million in untied road funding and spent it on City Rail. That is the sort of commitment that your side of politics has to this important highway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell members that the federal government has continued to fund the Pacific Highway. It has made major commitments, and the honourable member for Cowper alluded to and acknowledged this. In my own electorate the planning, the acquisition, the roundabouts for the Raymond Terrace bypass and the black spots funding between Raymond Terrace and Nabiac in the electorate of Paterson have been funded by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite keep talking about policies and about changes that will come in if, by some freak of nature, they happen to be on this side of the House after the next election. But let us just consider what one of your leaders told the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation. Every time we hear from that side of the House there is a different policy being put forward, but I will remind members that, at the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation, Tim Fischer said that your side of politics would not increase funding for rural and regional roads in Australia because they did not want to run the risk of increasing interest rates by competing for capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What policy will we accept from the National Party of Australia? I prefer to take the policy of the leader when he is addressing an organisation as influential as the National Farmers Federation. But I guess we will not know until an election is called when probably some more sexy, if I can use that adjective, policies come out that might appeal to voters. But I can tell you that those policies will definitely not contain the facts of the matter. They will not reveal the real level of funding by state and federal Labor governments on the Pacific Highway; they will attempt to conceal that, because that side of this House knows that it is Labor governments, both state and federal, that have had the commitment all along to funding a road which, federally, we do not have the responsibility for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parallel to the Pacific Highway, of course, runs our national rail line. We have seen significant funding there by the federal Labor government. We have seen an attempt to get the transport industry to use rail rather than road, to get the heavy transport off the roadway.

He might tell the House why the Carr government has completely canned the proposition of the Bulahdelah Mountain bypass, which was locked in place under the previous coalition government. The acquisitions were done and the design was done, but the Carr government is not going to do it&mdash;$120 million worth. It is the most important black spot on the Pacific Highway today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It always intrigues me when we get into debates like this that we get back to the semantics of what you can and cannot do. The bureaucracy in Australia is running rampant. In my years in public life in local government and in this place, I have been absolutely appalled at the attitude of the bureaucracy being focused on finding reasons why we cannot do something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem at hand is that we have a 700-odd kilometre road that in the last 10 years has not seen 600 people killed, as Mr Carleton reported on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> last night; it has seen 766 people killed and 10,000 people injured.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened to the national perspective? This is a road of national economic importance running between Sydney and Brisbane. Regardless of what you say, the region is growing at an enormous rate. Over 500,000 people live in the region. It is a road of major economic importance as a transport link, notwithstanding the rail between Sydney and Brisbane. We have to find a way of doing something about it and not just saying, `It's their responsibility. We haven't got the money.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government collects $10 billion from road users in Australia&mdash;$10 billion! In this year's budget they have spent $850 million. So over the life of the Labor government in Australia we have seen those two figures part&mdash;the amount collected heading up on an increasing tangent and the amount being spent going down. So just remember those figures, Mr Speaker: $10 billion collected and $850 million spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel tax revenue has increased from around 8c a litre in 1983 to 33c a litre today. But we are not seeing it spent back on the roads. We are not even seeing a reasonable percentage of it being spent back on the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion moved by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) today has a number of parts. The speakers today, coming from the areas they represent, are putting the most importance on the Pacific Highway because it is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure in Australia that has been totally neglected. We have not seen the Federal Highway, the Hume Highway or the highways down in this end of the country referred to. When you come south of Sydney, you are on magnificent roads all the way to the country's capital and all points south. When you go north it is a different story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion is about getting a realistic amount of revenue collected by the Commonwealth allocated by whatever means. It does not matter how it goes&mdash;whether it is back to the states as untied grants or SPPs going straight to local government. We just want to see a reasonable amount of the money that is collected by the Commonwealth aimed back at where it should be going&mdash;into road infrastructure whether it be on highways, country roads, country bridges or bridges in the city. We see plenty of money spent around the city, but the point is that it is not being redirected. I would like to know where a lot of that $10 billion is going&mdash;and so too would a lot of the people that pay petrol tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is important that we focus on that issue because of the size of Australia, the tyranny of distance. We are a very unique country: an enormous country with a small population. As I said, we are paying $10 billion in fuel taxes. The government has spent $850 million back on the roads. We are not seeing enough money being spent. We have to find a way instead of coming in here and saying, `We can't do it because of this and this or because of some 1974 agreement.' It is 20 years later!</PARA>

Then he will want to claim he has a mandate. On this side of the House we have made the point over and over that this is the second lowest taxed country in the Western world. The Treasurer said today that we would broadly maintain the present level of tax. The present level of tax is forecast at 23 per cent of GDP, in 1994-95. In 1983-84, when the government came to office&mdash;in a recession, when tax revenue had been badly hit&mdash;it was 23.1 per cent of GDP.

The Leader of the Opposition is determined not to actually put a firm statement down on anything. He is saying that he will not lift taxation or individual taxes and he will not cut spending. In other words, he will give up all of the instruments on fiscal policy and wish to be believed on it, and then when he gets asked persistently about any other matters&mdash;Medicare, wages, the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;no, he will not touch anything. `If you will just let us tippytoe into office we will then set up shop and our mandate will be: "You know what we have always had in mind"&mdash;not our written word, not our stated word.' That is not a mandate. The Leader of the Opposition will then say: `People know where we are coming from. They know what our views are.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the government came to office pensions were not indexed, certainly not twice yearly as they are now, and they were not adjusted in a discretionary way by further commitments by the government off the budget to the pension system and to pensioners. As a result, pensions were around 22-odd per cent of average weekly earnings. They are now at 25.7 per cent of average weekly earnings. The government had a target of getting pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. They are at 25.7 per cent of average weekly earnings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the opposition leader was last in office, the real value of pensions fell by two per cent. In fact, when the Whitlam government came to office, pensions were below 20 per cent of average weekly earnings. It was a commitment of the Whitlam government to bring them to 25 per cent, which brought into the public domain that commitment by Labor. I think it proves one point: when Labor governments are elected, age pensions go up; when coalition governments are elected, age pensions go down. That has been the accurate, historical fact. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition during an interview was asked about pensions. The interview went as follows:</PARA>

<PARA>That is, not any government he might lead&mdash;our government. In other words, he has slid by without making the commitment. Mr Speaker, you might recall that the Leader of the Opposition recently made a speech to ACOSS where he made it clear again that the only commitment would be the adjustment of the pension to the CPI&mdash;and nothing more. What needs to be understood is that if we assume that average weekly earnings increase, say, by around one per cent a year&mdash;and recently they have been going up by more than 1 1/2 per cent a year&mdash;over 10 years the pension would be 10 per cent higher in real terms than if you just maintained its real value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the commitment to giving the pension a relationship to average weekly earnings means not just an adjustment in real terms to maintain it, but to let it grow along with the rest of the work force so its relative purchasing power is improved. So if you have real increases in wages, meaning above the inflation rate, you get real increases in the pension. That is what he will not commit to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make this point again to all those pensioners, particularly those in the demographic group who have a tendency to support the coalition: John Howard will cut the real value of your pension. John Howard will cut the relative purchasing power of your pension. He has proven it. If he gets into office, he will say, `You know the team. You know where we have come from. Look at my speech to ACOSS.' Was there any mention of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings? Someone will say, `Mr Howard, you put out a statement on 26 November 1995 that said it.' He will say, `Look at our main speech to ACOSS. Look at the things that I have said on the record.' That is the game that the Leader of the Opposition is playing.</PARA>

I have been through that issue in the House on a number of occasions. Let me give you the numbers again. Revenue to GDP is at 23 per cent. It is exactly where it was in the recession year of 1983-84.

In other words, we are paying taxpayers back more than what we said we would in the One Nation statement of 1992. That is the government's record. The fact that we remain the second lowest taxed country in the OECD makes it very clear that we in Australia are running a relatively small public sector very efficiently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the House that the government has retained its commitment to keeping the pension at or above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That is one of a number of key social benchmarks that the government has adopted over the years. In fact, we have had that as an objective for some considerable time. We have been able to achieve that benchmark since 1990 and to equal or exceed it ever since. That is very significant. By contrast, during the period of the coalition government the pension was allowed to drift down to 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings and there was a two per cent real reduction in the pension rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to bear in mind the nature of a commitment of that sort and set it against the sorts of statements that emanate from the opposition about what it claims it can do on the fiscal policy front. Those opposite have made statements implying that they can take around $10 billion off outlays. The Leader of the Opposition gave a statement in his address to ACOSS and said that he would not take $10 billion off the social safety net. There is no ambiguity about the implication of the opposition's policy. It says it would get the budget into surplus without asset sales. On the adjusted ABS definition, that implies a $10 billion cut in outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give some idea of what maintaining the sort of commitment that the government has on pensions implies in terms of outlays, on 22 September this year the government increased the base pension for single people by $9.80 a fortnight and for each member of a married couple by $8.20 a fortnight. That adjustment to the pension was made on 22 September this year. The budgetary cost of that, when you take into account flow-ons to other payments, was around $800 million in a full year. That is the sort of commitment on the outlay side that is required in order to maintain that sort of commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a stumblebum performance by the Leader of the Opposition on Sunday, in a situation where he had given no commitment on that 25 per cent issue, he issued a press release at 5 o'clock yesterday saying that he would. How on earth are the opposition going to reconcile the achievement of that sort of social policy objective with the sorts of statements they have made on fiscal policy? This is something that arises time and again and which they refuse to address in any coherent or sensible way. If you look at the performance of this government compared with that of the coalition in terms of the social safety net, you see that the record under us has been consistent real improvements whereas the record under the coalition has been consistent real declines. If we had done no more than index the pension since we came into office, a single pensioner would be getting from $20 per week less and a married couple would be getting from $34 per week less. The reality is that there is no coherency or sense in the coalition's statements in these areas. There is no reason that the pensioners of this country could have to believe any commitments coming from the coalition. Their record is the diametrical opposite of maintenance and improvement of that safety net. That is a direct and very clear contrast with the actual performance of this government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again go back to the Leader of the Opposition's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> interview yesterday. He had a right little blow-out on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't accept for a moment that we went to the last election as Paul Keating alleges promising to abolish Medicare; that is wrong, we didn't.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that with intonation and meaning. The Fightback changes included Medicare for pensioners and card holders only and bulk-billing abolished for Medicare except for welfare recipients. If that is not the destruction of Medicare, what is? If that is not the destruction of the universality of the system, what is? That was only three years ago. That has followed the general views he has put over the period. When he was leader he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Medicare system is a total disaster. We will be proposing changes to Medicare that amount to its de facto dismantling.</PARA>
<PARA>The questioner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will pull it right apart?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, we will pull it right apart.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was plain enough. That is his view. It has always been his view. But there was more of it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second thing we will do is we will get rid of the bulk-billing system, it is an absolute rort.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that, if you are going to pull it apart and dismantle it and get rid of the bulk-billing system because it is a rort, what you really mean to do is hop into Medicare. So the questioner&mdash;it was actually Mr Laws&mdash;says to him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . so really what you are saying is what you will do is take us back to how things were pre-Medicare?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As best we can, yes, recognising that in a society you never go completely back, but I would love to go back.</PARA>
<PARA>What he would like to do is really go back. We know where back means. It is about 1953, in the dreamtime of his political life. The fact is: basically what he means is, `Medicare is a total disaster. We will propose changes that amount to its de facto dismantling. We will pull it right apart. We will get rid of bulk-billing. It is a rort. And we will go back to pre-Medicare.' That is his position. It is all out there in his health policy. In 1987 he says he will allow opting out of the Medicare arrangements, abolish bulk-billing and says that Medicare is a failure. What he says on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> is not what he says when asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, Mr Howard, you have not put all your policies in the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People know where we stand. They know who the team will be.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words&mdash;wink, wink&mdash;`We'll be there, where we have always been, for our old, long-run position to policies.' The long-run position to policies is to smash Medicare. That has always been his position. Then he was contesting yesterday that the Fraser government did not abolish Medicare. In fact what Mr Fraser said is, `We are going to maintain the Medibank scheme. The scheme will continue as it was introduced.' That is pretty much almost word for word. Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lot of people will say that the changes Fraser made did not amount to dismantling Medicare . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He thinks he is good with the words. He thinks the media and the public will not understand what he is in fact saying. There is only one party that will keep universality of health protection in Australia, and that is the Labor Party. That is the only party that will keep health protection as a common right, as a public right in this country. What would happen under a Howard government is that they would go back to a two-tiered medical system: the well-heeled system for the wealthy and basically public squalor for those who might somehow pay to keep a toehold in it. But the whole question of universality would go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told the House not long ago about what sorts of funds are involved in a rebate system for private health insurance of the kind the Leader of the Opposition espouses. Of course, this is the sort of money that would hit the budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, with private health fund reserves over $1.6 billion now, why would the Leader of the Opposition decide to give another billion dollars to the private health system?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the public of Australia should rest assured on these things: when John Howard says he will maintain Medicare, don't believe him. The only party that will maintain Medicare and keep it growing is of course the government.</PARA>

In other words, the Court government has used its executive arm through a royal commissioner to get the cabinet details and discussions of the former government. This is a breach of the way in which the system operates.

They compound the indecency, the political stupidity, of setting this up by then saying that the minister had no right to defend herself and that the Commonwealth should not support her defence, on behalf of all MPs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important for members to recognise that Commonwealth expenditure has continued to increase in health generally. In 1991-92 it was approximately $13.8 billion, by 1994-95 it was $17.4 billion and specific funding to hospitals has increased by $800 million since 1991-92. So we have been doing our bit. Over that same two-year period, the states managed to slash $700 million from the same hospital budgets&mdash;$700 million while we are putting in $800 million.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition wanted to say, `You pick it all up by improving private health cover and the use of private hospitals.' But what he does not understand is that, every time you cut services in public hospitals, you are not just increasing waiting lists&mdash;which is what those governments have been doing&mdash;you are cutting the availability of material for scientists, and the generation to be trained is being sold short.

It is for that reason that it deserves to be treated with the utter contempt it deserves&mdash;contempt for the government which corruptly arranged for its sitting and its terms of reference; for the Leader of the Opposition and the former deputy leader, the member for Chisholm, who connived in the terms of reference; for Mr Richard Court who could not remember speaking to Mr Howard&mdash;he would not say he did not speak to him but he could not remember; and for the manner in which the people were called.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of first calling the petitioner, Mr Easton, or the person who wrote the petition, the clerk, or the person who presented the petition, Mr Halden, who was the first witness? A former press secretary to the minister!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I indicated to the House the other day, we find that Mr Richard Court's private staff had given briefings to the commission before it actually undertook its proceedings. In other words, the process was entirely corrupted. As I said at the beginning of all this, no Queen's Counsel, no barrister, and no former judge should trust their reputations with a reference like this. But Mr Marks, in my view naively and foolishly, did and he has worn the admonition and the consequences as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our point of view on this side of the House we regard the whole process as disreputable. The minister's standing in public life has been obvious for all to see. She quite courageously set up an open royal commission on proper terms of reference into what was called WA Inc. That action left her with quite a few enemies in Western Australia, some of whom had a chance to catch up with her during these grubby proceedings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. What is the status of action to implement a uniform credit code? Has the Tasmanian parliament ratified that code? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3790" SPEAKER="McHugh The Hon J." NAMEID="ZH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GRAYNDLER" MINISTERIAL="CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZH4">Ms McHUGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that the honourable member asked actually exposes a disgraceful and scandalous state of affairs, in that a few members of the upper house in Tasmania are holding hostage every consumer in Australia who is waiting for the benefits of the uniform credit legislation. We have been waiting for this uniform legislation for years, although all states and territories agreed to it nearly two years ago. Consumers are waiting for it because of the very considerable benefits that they will get, particularly in relation to the disclosure of detailed information. The banks are waiting for it, because the banking code of practice cannot come into operation until a uniform credit code is in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland was the first state to pass the template legislation, and all states have now passed it except for Western Australia and Tasmania. I am informed that it will pass through the lower house of the Western Australian parliament in the next couple of weeks, but it is a very different story in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in Tasmania is this. The bill to enact uniform credit legislation was sent back to the lower house from the upper house with an amendment to exempt three Tasmanian based finance companies from its provisions. These companies are reported to be the Hobart based Personal Finance Co., the Launceston based Lendco Pty Ltd and the Smithton based Braddon Investment and Finance Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been reported to my office that the companies have concerns with the code's rules concerning the precontractual disclosure of establishment fees. You have to ask why they would have problems with that. It has also been reported to my office that these three finance companies have very close links with members of the Tasmanian upper house. Indeed, the Deputy Leader for the Government in the upper house, Tony Fletcher, has declared that he is a shareholder in one of these companies, and other members also reportedly have connections. That is what has been reported to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian government refused to accept the amendment to exempt these companies, so the bill has lapsed. That means that, as a result of what appears to be some pretty personal interests&mdash;some declared, some not&mdash;of a few members of the Tasmanian upper house, all consumers in Australia will not have the benefit of this uniform credit legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Lyons asked what can be done about this. The fact is that this is state and territory legislation&mdash;it is not Commonwealth legislation. But I can inform members that the Commonwealth is represented on the Standing Committee on Consumer Affairs, which met last Friday. That committee will propose that state and territory consumer affairs ministers agree to an implementation date of 1 August 1996 for the code and that they proceed without Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot therefore is that, if the states and territories do not agree to that recommendation, the implementation of a uniform credit code is under serious threat. It also means that, if they do agree, Tasmanian consumers will miss out on the benefits that every other Australian consumer will enjoy under the legislation&mdash;all because three small, local Tasmanian finance companies, which obviously have very good connections in the Legislative Council, want to escape providing their customers with the protection which this legislation ensures and which every consumer in Australia is waiting for.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We reaffirm that, according to Biblical law, it is forbidden for a male to practise sexual intercourse with another male, or for a female with a female, and that since this is an abomination before the Lord, such as a prohibited relationship for marriage.

<TITLE>Public Service: Staff Cuts</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5B6">Mr SMYTH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Canberra)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (4.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is about time this government came clean on what it is up to with Public Service staffing numbers. You may recall that in May, before the budget, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> ran a line that up to 4,000 public servants in this town may lose their jobs. Being the member for Canberra, it is important to me and to all my constituents because so much of the business that is conducted here in Canberra depends on the Public Service. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters (Mr Johns) did not know and could not say how many jobs would go. The minister could not say what the implications were in the budget for Public Service numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote the minister a letter and in that letter I referred to recent media reports in which it was claimed that the government intends to make large cuts to the Australian Public Service as a result of the 1995 budget. I wrote to him on behalf of all Canberrans, expecting a reasonable answer. You will be amazed, I am sure, when you find out that in the letter I got back from the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters he claimed that he did not know how many jobs would be going. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the implementation of the Government's Budget decisions is the responsibility of individual portfolio ministers and their Departments, I am unable to provide you with the precise figures on the possible staffing impact of the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough, I guess. It means that, like so much of the Public Service, the responsibility has been devolved to the departmental level and they spend their money as they see appropriate. That was okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then put a question on notice to each of the ministers asking, given that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters had said they would know, whether they would please tell me what the implications of this year's budget were on Public Service numbers. I did that on 30 June. I am sure you will be surprised to find out that, so far, I have not had a single response. What I have actually had is nothing. It was just a waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was forced to ask the Speaker on 17 and 24 October if he would write to the ministers and get them to respond to me. The Speaker kindly did so. I am getting back answers that are a bit of a form letter. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 17 October 1995 in which you pointed out that a Question on Notice . . . placed by Mr BM Smyth, Member for Canberra . . . had not been answered within the 90 day answering period. You would be aware this same question was also posed to 20 other Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent to this question I have been advised by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that the Minister for Finance will respond on behalf of all Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>This is very curious because the minister responsible for the Public Service could not answer that question himself, but it would now appear that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) is well able to do that. It is curious because the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been coordinating this response through the Minister for Finance since about mid-July. Even if you allow them 90 days from mid-July, that would give a response date of mid-October. Here we are almost in December and we still do not know what the implications of this year's budget are on Public Service numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is extraordinary. Not only is it extraordinary because it is a total disregard for the parliamentary and democratic processes, but obviously the government holds all public servants in contempt. Obviously, the government does not know what they are doing with the Public Service. I think this is part of the malaise that found voice so clearly in the Canberra by-election when so many Canberrans felt they had been treated with arrogance and contempt by this government&mdash;given that the Public Service is the main industry of the ACT, that the government does not know what they are doing with public servants and Public Service numbers inside the ACT show that the government has not learnt from the Canberra by-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This also raises the question of whether or not the minister is competent to continue in his portfolio. If the Minister for Finance can come up with these answers, or is indeed charged with coming up with these answers, how is it that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters cannot? It is curious that the minister assisting said that only the departments could answer because of the devolved responsibilities. It may well have been easy for him to have asked all the other ministers to give him the answers and to put an answer to my question together, but obviously he was not up to it because PM&amp;C has decided that the Minister for Finance should do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that PM&amp;C is actually coordinating this and that the Minister for Finance will do it, the question is raised: when will this happen and how long will it take? We are almost five months into the new budget cycle and this government still does not know what it is doing with the Public Service, and it does not know what it is doing with Public Service numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is evident in a couple of other areas as well when you take into account things like the MPRA review of the Australian War Memorial, which went so badly for the government, and indeed when you take into account that new Public Service legislation was supposed to be before this House before the end of the year. I had a meeting with the Public Service Commissioner the other day and he kindly told me that it would appear that the new Public Service legislation will be presented in this House at the earliest in possibly March next year. In fact, the Public Service Commissioner and some of the other departments are getting ready to present new legislation in July next year. It makes you wonder who is in charge of Public Service activities inside this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it goes on. In the last 12 months we have seen the number of public servants axed under this government double. The government is quite capable of producing the figures for the number of public servants it has axed, but it does not know how many it is going to get rid of. It can do it for last year, but it cannot do it for this year. Does that mean we now have to wait until next year to find out what was done in this year? If you have any management experience, you would know that that is not a very competent or a very obliging way to run a business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Minister for Finance is now working on the answer, and he is&mdash;one of the letters I got back stated that he is `currently seeking more information'&mdash;where will this answer come from and how is it that the minister assisting could not do this? It seems curious that one of the most senior ministers in the government has been tasked with the fairly simple task of asking 21 departments how many public servants they are going to axe this year, if they are going to axe any, when the minister assisting could not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does his inability to answer these questions say about his entire management of the Public Service and, indeed, about the new Public Service Act? I think it is up to the minister to answer what he really does as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters and whether he is doing anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, in this country we have the great problem of youth unemployment. Over the last few years, APS employment of young people under the age of 25 has dropped by 60 per cent. Again, that input of new individuals into the Public Service itself is not happening. Young people in the ACT are being denied an opportunity to get into the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a minister who does not know how many people he is in control of. We have a minister that allows things like the MPRA review of the War Memorial to go ahead without any apology when it is found to be faulty. And now we have a minister overseeing a Public Service that is denying positions to young people in my electorate and, indeed, all electorates around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that makes me worried about the administration of the Public Service and the things that are going on now is the number of departments that have been transferred out of Canberra and, in general, the decline in the numbers in the Public Service. If we look at the actual figures the budget papers contain, we see that the drop was about 1,700. I fully expected to get that back as an answer, but obviously that is not the right answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this now does is throw into doubt the whole validity of the budget papers. The budget papers and the ASL are how the government works out its expenditure on public servants. Given that there is one figure in the budget papers that the government is obviously not willing to back up, what are the true figures and what are the implications for Public Service expenditure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government have placed a lot of credibility on the question of this year's budget but if they cannot answer how many public servants they expect to employ this year, then any figures that they have put forward in relation to expenditure on wages must also be very rubbery. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this throws this year's budget into further doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Canberra is the national capital and it is right that there are Public Service functions here. Given that about 48 per cent of the employment in this city is provided by the Public Service, these are important questions to all Canberrans. Indeed, the government's policy, how the government administers this country and how the government spends taxpayers' money are important questions to all Australians. If the government are appropriating money and putting money towards public servants that they do not even know whether they have, then you have to call into question the administration of the Australian Public Service by this government; you have to call into question the administration of the Australian Public Service by the current minister and you have to call into question how accurate the budget figures are in relation to public servants and Public Service expenditure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is about a subject that is debated quite a lot in this place: aircraft noise around airports. Earlier today I presented a petition to the Bills and Papers Office obtaining 1,221 signatures. The petition reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The humble petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That we oppose the construction of <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sydney West Airport at Badgerys Creek</EMPHASIS> by the Federal Government, without a new and comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) being completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous EIS was done over ten years ago, and did not take account of the rapid growth in our area or the inadequacy of aircraft noise prediction techniques. The noise problems experienced at Kingsford Smith Airport will be worse in our area as Sydney West will operate twenty four hours a day over now quiet semi-rural and residential areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will not allow construction of Sydney West Airport at Badgerys Creek until a new and comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray."</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the petition has 1,221 signatures, and I understand there are many more on the way. The petition reflects the deep concern amongst residents in my electorate and neighbouring electorates about the likely effect of the construction and operation of Sydney West airport. This concern has obviously increased dramatically since the opening of the third runway at Sydney airport in November last year and the resulting noise problem in the inner city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The publicity surrounding the chaos caused by the new runway at Mascot could not have been missed by residents in my electorate, particularly as it has become fashionable for inner city politicians to say that the answer to the noise problems in Sydney is to fast-track Badgerys Creek airport. There is no doubt that Sydney badly needs a second international airport and has done for many years. But it is not good enough for inner city politicians, would-be politicians and single issue parties to simply presume that they can fix their noise problem by moving the noise out west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become quite clear from this petition and from the hundreds of letters and phone calls I have received in my electorate office that residents in my electorate will not cop aircraft noise being transferred out there and will certainly not cop anything like the level of noise now being experienced in places like Marrickville and Sydenham. Indeed, I regularly receive phone calls and letters from all over my electorate from places like Theresa Park, Thirlmere, Tahmoor, Bradbury, Narellan, Camden and Warragamba. These people do not want this airport because in many cases they moved away from inner Sydney to get away from aircraft noise and pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I even get many calls from people in the Thirlmere area complaining about current aircraft noise associated with the changed flight paths to Mascot airport. At first I found this unbelievable, but I have noticed when flying from Canberra to Sydney that the planes are flying a different route than they used to&mdash;we know that&mdash;and in many cases are flying much lower than previously. So you can understand the concerns people have about the likely noise impact of Badgerys Creek  airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has said many times that in the construction of Sydney West airport we do not want to repeat the mistakes of Kingsford Smith airport. One of the first mistakes which should not be repeated is to proceed with construction of the airport at Badgerys Creek without a comprehensive, up-to-date EIS, particularly examining the questions of noise, air and water pollution. The government has already announced a study to update some aspects of the previous EIS, which was done in 1985. Whether this will satisfy the concerns of residents remains to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it can be argued that you don't need to completely repeat the 1985 study, which included geological and other details which would not require updating, the request contained in the petition for a new and comprehensive EIS is nevertheless valid. As the petition points out, the 1985 EIS did not take account of the rapid housing development and population growth in the surrounding areas. Due to the policies of the previous Liberal state government, there has been considerable urban expansion in the surrounding areas since 1988. These include housing estates at Cecil Park and Silverdale in my electorate. The previous state government had also planned a huge housing development at South Creek, but this has not proceeded. There has also been rapid growth around Narellan, Mount Annan, Currans Hill and to the south of Campbelltown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Macarthur region is the fastest growing area in New South Wales. People throughout the electorate of Macarthur, as well as those in the adjoining electorates of Werriwa and Prospect, are expressing concern about where the flight paths from Badgerys Creek might go. It is not a simple matter of transferring the aircraft noise out west to overcome the problems in the inner city. One of the issues for Macarthur, which includes rural and semi-rural areas, is that there is much less background noise than there is in the inner suburbs of Sydney, so the impact of any aircraft noise will be much greater on residents in these areas than otherwise would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All governments make mistakes and if governments remain in office for a long period they are bound to make mistakes. I believe one of the greatest mistakes made by this government was in 1989 when it decided to build the third runway at Mascot rather than getting on with building a second airport. Having nominated Badgerys Creek as the site for the second airport in 1985, and having completed an EIS at that time, the government should have got on with the job of building the airport then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like most Labor politicians at federal, state and local government level in Sydney, I opposed the third runway at Mascot. Interestingly, the coalition supported it. As we have seen in this House in recent weeks, we now have the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the former Premier, now Liberal candidate for Macarthur, John Fahey, playing opportunist politics with the issue of airports and aircraft noise, despite their well-recorded previous positions on this issue. Clearly, one of the problems with the third runway and the resultant noise chaos is that the EIS process was less than satisfactory. Let us ensure that this mistake is not repeated at Sydney West airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly, the draft flight paths for Sydney West will become known. This will hopefully clarify the situation for many residents who will find that they may not be affected at all by aircraft noise from the new airport. It will also reduce the scope for scaremongering by the opposition over aircraft noise. Nevertheless, I urge the government to at the very least conduct a comprehensive review of the 1985 EIS in all relevant aspects, such as aircraft noise, noise pollution, air pollution and water pollution, and to do that before construction of the airport commences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times a bill to privatise airports has been blocked in the Senate and this is likely to hold up the construction of Badgerys Creek airport. This is unfortunate. It had been the government's plan, supported I understand by all sides of the House, to build the airport by the year 2000. Hopefully, that will still be possible, but it should not go ahead without an updated environmental impact statement which will look at various aspects such as noise. Otherwise the people of south-west Sydney and people in my electorate will not be satisfied that they should have to put up with a new airport, especially given the horrendous outcome of the third runway and the noise that people are copping in Sydney. As bad as that is, it is not satisfactory to transfer the noise to the western suburbs&mdash;any more than it is satisfactory to do what the Leader of the Opposition suggested: that is, share the noise around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important issue which must be clarified and determined as quickly as possible. This is an area where a lot of young people buy their first home. They move there to get away from Sydney&mdash;to get away from the city life, aircraft noise and other things. It is very important that the matter is clarified very soon. I look forward to seeing the draft flight paths at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the House what a member referred to the `ugly Australian' last Wednesday. The member for Deakin (Mr Aldred), from a separate and independent source, came to the same conclusion as I did&mdash;that Westpac is abusing its banking licence and the legal system to prevent its becoming accountable for all its deficiencies revealed in what is known as the Westpac or French letters. My concern goes to the inquiry by the then House of Representatives finance and public administration committee into banking and deregulation. Its first report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A pocketful of change</EMPHASIS> was tabled in the House of Representatives in November 1991 and its follow-up <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Checking the changes</EMPHASIS> in October 1992. The member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) and I are the only remaining members of that original committee still on the current banking, finance and public administration committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of the first report that I can recall is that some of the major banks, under their deregulated role, went deeply into foreign currency loans on behalf of clients and never had the experience or the staff to properly market and service the product. Westpac's whole litany of inexperience and then deceit was offered up by the bank's Mr Stuart Fowler in a series of letters between the bank and its lawyers, Allen Allen and Hemsley. It is on the public record that on 7 March 1991 these letters were tabled at the inquiry. The committee indicated that it would thoroughly examine the issues raised in the letters as well as the more general matter of foreign currency loans. In fact, this became a prominent part of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Senator McLean provided a mass of evidence to the committee in connection with not only these but also many other matters with other banks where he maintained the banks were abusing their banking licences. The then Senator McLean called on the committee to recommend a royal commission into these abuses by the banks. Unfortunately, as I now view subsequent and current tactics, especially by Westpac, we made the wrong decision in not insisting on a judicial inquiry or a royal commission at that time. Our only recommendation on the Westpac letters was recommendation 61:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General refer the so called Westpac Letters to the National Crime Authority for investigation as to whether any criminal wrong doings arise from the management of foreign exchange contracts by Partnership Pacific Limited.</PARA>
<PARA>While I understand that the letters were referred to the National Crime Authority, no action was taken. These papers were not tested. The most self-incriminatory piece of evidence given to the inquiry was not investigated and the only reason I have been given is that the NCA had insufficient resources and funds. No wonder so many people hurt, not only by Westpac but also by other banks, have lost faith in our parliamentary system, our committees and this report. I believe and now recommend that the government should set up a royal commission or a judicial inquiry to inquire into the Westpac letters and other related matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to a related matter which required litigation by former clients of the banks. The committee heard evidence about the cost of the settlement of cases and dispute resolution. It was obvious from evidence that banks could force former clients to insolvency in legal and court costs before the matter could be properly judged by a court. This surplus of funds by the banks to engage top lawyers and expend large amounts&mdash;all tax deductible&mdash;was in contrast to the financial resources to respond with adequate funds, not tax deductible, for legal expenses by the client. This led to recommendation 60:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that an independent mediator (or mediators), funded by the banks, but acceptable to both banks and foreign currency borrowers be appointed to mediate in foreign currency loans cases that remain in dispute. Mediation is not compulsory, banks will pay for their own mediators or for a general mediator based on usage. The determinations of the mediator will not be binding on either party. Banks should endeavour, to the extent possible, to advise all foreign currency loan borrowers of the mediatory mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some banks have engaged in meaningful dispute resolution. Westpac has not. The member for Deakin gave a detailed summary of one such case. I have evidence of another. This case ended in Westpac bankrupting Heather and John Donkin after unsuccessfully endeavouring to have that done by the Taxation Office on its behalf and then having to do it itself to ensure that a bankrupt could not continue a case against it. In fact, the solicitors for AGC Advances Ltd&mdash;Messrs Clayton Utz&mdash;followed this decision up with the official receiver in Brisbane requesting the trustee to elect whether or not he wished to continue with court action and, further, to undertake not to assign interest to Mr Donkin or any other person in that case. This is typical of the intimidatory actions that this bank is capable of producing. The effect on the Donkins of this and the letters in the Drambo, or Porters, case was to dissuade some of those who were representing the Donkins to cease their services under the threat that costs in the eventual pursuance of the case would be sought against the representatives in the event the bank won the court action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other matters, post the banking inquiry, not mentioned or investigated to any extent are now coming to light in other court cases and those settled on the court steps, such as Stringer v. ANZ in South Australia. These additional points include: the extent of point taking by the banks at the expense of the client&mdash;in Drambo's case, I understand this part of the claim is for $3 million or $4 million; whether in fact the client actually borrowed foreign currency or whether the bank did itself and, upon bringing the proceeds onshore, then lent to the client but charged the client for the exchange losses and took the profit of point making for itself; and the fact that withholding tax should have never been deducted from clients' funds, as found in subsequent cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, I can report that AGC Advances intentions have apparently been thwarted by a letter I received from the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 9 October 1995 to the Attorney-General in which you made representations on behalf of your constituents, Mr C J and Mrs H K Donkin, both of whom are bankrupt, in relation to their proposed High Court action against AGC Advances Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, on the bankruptcy of Mr Donkin, his right to conduct the action vested in the trustee of his estate (the Official Trustee). I note that, under subsection 60(2) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bankruptcy Act 1966</EMPHASIS>, the Official Receiver . . . has elected not to continue the action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I understand that, so as not to frustrate the Donkins' action, the Official Receiver proposes assigning the rights in it to Mr Donkin. The assignment would allow Mr Donkin to continue the action, notwithstanding that he is bankrupt.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem still remains for the Donkins, having already expended thousands of dollars in legal representation, now being bankrupted and now in view of the more recent Westpac letters threats of Feez Ruthoning: where do they go? Particularly when negligence has been found against AGC Advances in the court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of justice, legal aid should be given to provide competent representation to Donkins, Potts, Porters and others. There is a need for the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to follow through on a notice of motion that I have initiated for debate in this House, which stands on today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> at No. 11, where I am suggesting that legal expenses be non-tax deductible to banks, particularly in these cases, so there can be some equality and justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have followed the case of the Donkins since it came to my notice after the inquiry. I have corresponded with the law section of the bank to argue the case and have received no satisfaction whatsoever. What can you argue against a bank's representative who says, `We have spent over $1 million on the particular Donkins' case and don't intend to lose it now,' even to the point of prosecution into bankruptcy, which was their answer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the law section of Westpac act in isolation from the rest of the bank whose only instruction is, apparently, to ensure that the Westpac letters are put to rest permanently and to ensure the statute of limitations works in the bank's favour, which it currently is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final observation on this whole matter is that neither the government nor the Reserve Bank is prepared to uphold its own legislation and regulations. In the Banking Act 1959 under `Interpretation', `prudential matters', in relation to the bank, means, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to keep itself in a sound financial position; and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) with integrity, prudence and professional skill;</PARA>
<PARA>The Westpac letters are evidence, as is an examination of the cases of Donkins and Potts. The recent letters of Feez Ruthoning prove that banks have no integrity in this regard, no prudence, and had no professional skill when foreign currency loans were first marketed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have placed questions on notice to the Reserve Bank to determine whether such Westpac practices should mean a review of the licence under which that bank operates with impunity from the law. In a recent letter to the Treasurer for intervention in the Donkins' case, I received an answer from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) who said that he had no right of intervention because of the separation of powers. I believe the Assistant Treasurer is wrong. It is a matter for him, the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank to conduct a thorough examination of the bank's conduct that should affect the conduct of its licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there should be a royal commission or a judicial inquiry into the Westpac letters; legal aid should be made available to litigants in the cases I have mentioned; consideration should be given to ensure that the bank's litigation expenses are not tax deductible; and a review should be undertaken of all banking licences on the basis of the prudential requirements of the act. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been an interesting few days. The ACCI chief, Ian Spicer, is to quit. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has repudiated deeply-held beliefs. Joh Bjelke-Petersen Jr has won National Party pre-selection for the federal election. The member for Bennelong renounced beliefs that have been close to his heart all his life. The Irish legalised divorce. And the Leader of the Opposition discarded his beliefs and emerged a new man deeply in love with pensioners, workers and other welfare recipients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add to the interests of the week, the Liberals have gone into the trucking business. The Liberal's trucking tours let people know that things may not be all that good now&mdash;but things are a lot better than they were when the now Leader of the Opposition was in office and unemployment, interest rates and inflation were rampant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> was a scream. On page 40, the Leader of the Opposition says that a coalition&mdash;in the unlikely event of them gaining government&mdash;would require Telstra to speed up its national upgrade of telephone exchanges over the next few years. However, on the previous page, his deputy lists 13 points in the coalition's economic policy. Point number 10 says, `Sell off Telstra.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), a proud protege of John Stone, should have closer dialogue with his boss. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes a number of admissions in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. He says he believes that modesty is a virtue, and confesses that he is not a big spender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the opposition is going around talking to interest groups, or should I say self-interest groups, and is giving a wink and a nod to every group to whom they speak, but will not spell out where the money is coming from to fund the sweeteners that they are offering. No wonder the top end of town is pleased and no wonder the pensioners and welfare recipients are terrified. Look out Medicare&mdash;smash! Look out child care&mdash;smash! Look out age care&mdash;smash! Look out equity and fairness. And look out workers. It is no wonder that Labor is surging back in the opinion polls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, enough of political debate. It is nearing Christmas, a time of peace and goodwill and I am sure people would not mind a change of pace. I know all members are most anxious to hear of the good things that are happening in the electorate of Hunter where the very best wines are produced, where the people are the friendliest and where caring people cooperate to help their area prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides mines, wines and people, the Hunter has dairy and beef cattle, wool, grains and horses. Let me tell you a story about horses. There are many splendid thoroughbred horse studs in Scone and throughout the remainder of the valley and these studs and horse racing are integral features of the Hunter Valley tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good people of Scone regard their beautiful town as the horse capital of Australia, but others would have disputed their right to that title until this year. That title will not be disputed after recent funding grants. Earlier this year the federal government granted $5 million for a new TAFE college at Scone which will have subjects oriented to the horse breeding industry. Then the state government came along and funded $6 million for a beautiful new racecourse in Scone. Then, last Friday, Minister Howe made a grant of $3.185 million for an equine research centre, and that was all federally funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will understand that this is a development of regional, state, national and even international significance. The state government has also provided money for the building of 400 horse stables. The courses which will be put on the curriculum at the Scone TAFE will draw students from throughout Asia and throughout the world. This will be a massive boost for the whole Hunter Valley, and Australia will benefit greatly as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday evening I went to a celebration dinner for the Johns brothers&mdash;Matthew and Andrew. The Johns brothers come from Cessnock, the town in which I live. Cessnock has produced three rugby league internationals: Frank Stanmore, Dave Parkinson and Don Schofield. Because my wife, Anne, had taught both Matthew and Andrew in kindergarten, she gave a great speech and told what they were like as young lads. But she made a dreadful mistake. With about 350 people there, she admitted, she confessed, she stated quite clearly, that she hated rugby league. She forgot to explain it was because she had to wash my dirty washing when I played and she had to wash the dirty garments when her two sons, Mark and Joel, played. But it was a great night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on the topic of sport, I want to mention Kurri Kurri, which is only a couple of kilometres down the road from my place. This year, in the very strong Newcastle rugby league competition, Kurri won its third straight first grade premiership&mdash;three first grade premierships, year after year. It is a magnificent team and a magnificent achievement for a relatively small town such as Kurri Kurri. Not surprisingly, Kurri has produced more rugby league internationals than any other town in Australia&mdash;I think the number is 10 or 11&mdash;and, rightly, those people are so very proud of their rugby league prowess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not only excel in rugby league in the Hunter. Steve Merrick, from the Singleton Rugby Club, represented Australia in this year's Bledisloe Cup. Singleton was premier in the very strong Newcastle competition. It won the premiership this year for the second year in a row. This year's win was more scintillating than last year's because Singleton went through the competition undefeated. This year the small town of Weston won the first, reserve and under-21 years premierships in the Northern New South Wales state soccer competition. Weston is the first ever club to achieve this feat. These are just a few of the sporting achievements within my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further up the valley in small towns like Quirindi, Willow Tree, Murrurundi, Muswellbrook, Merriwa, Denman and Sandy Hollow the young people are right into their sport. What better way in which to engage themselves than to engage in sports of all kinds. Every sport imaginable is played in the Hunter. Every week I enjoy picking up the paper and reading of some outstanding achievement by some youngster in primary school or secondary school, or by some other young person who is excelling. Last Saturday, I officially opened the swimming season at the Kurri Kurri swimming pool. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to grieve for the more than 860,000 small businesses in Australia, particularly those in the rural and regional areas, for the treatment they have received at the hands of the Keating federal government. A recent Yellow Pages small business survey reveals that the Keating federal government's policies are working against their best interests. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small business index</EMPHASIS> is the largest economic survey of small business in Australia and focuses specifically on businesses employing 19 people or fewer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interviewing for this survey was conducted over the period from 24 October to 7 November 1995, so it is current. The index used a panel of at least 1,200 randomly-selected small business proprietors, who were interviewed by telephone every three months. The panel, drawn from all metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions of Australia, tapped into non-metropolitan regions of Australia, which makes this quite unique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The areas of activity tapped into cover manufacturing; building and construction; wholesale/retail; transport, storage; finance, property and business services; and recreation, personal and other services. One omission from that would be the farming sector. Small business and farmers go hand in hand. They operate as small business people. This survey involved 1,200 people in total. In the metropolitan area, 910 people were surveyed; in the non-metropolitan areas, 290 people were surveyed. That gives an indication of the breadth of this survey and its findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitudes in this survey to federal government policy are what makes this quite a remarkable and very active document. Reasons why proprietors of these businesses view the federal government as unsupportive were also canvassed in the November 1995 survey. According to the survey:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lack of incentive is the number one concern&mdash;voiced by 24% of those who find Federal Government policies to be working against small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation issues are also high on the agenda, with many complaining about too many taxes, too high taxes or specific taxes such as sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know how the Keating government has increased wholesale sales tax since it came back into government in 1993. The survey continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bureaucracy and a limited understanding of small business needs also figure prominently, as does concern about IR policies or unfair dismissal legislation. Grouping similar responses, reveals the following hierarchy of concerns:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxes (33%)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bureaucracy/red tape/paperwork (26%)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of incentives (24%)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of understanding/only concerned with big business (20%)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations policies (18%)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government charges (15%)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation (13%).</PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder that that attitude comes through from small business throughout Australia? The member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), in debate on a matter of public importance, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in all his arrogance&mdash;at the height of arrogance&mdash;declared to small business, `This is as good as it gets. What are you complaining about? If you cannot make it in this climate, go out and get yourselves a PAYE job.'</PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder that the federal government is held in very scant regard by small business in Australia? It becomes even worse when the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), during the early part of November, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best possible thing this government could do for small business is to create an economic environment in which small business can flourish&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not disagree with that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a climate of sustained growth, which we are managing to do with 3of a per cent growth this year; a low inflation environment; an interest rate environment that is extremely modest by any previous comparison . . . and activity because business is profitable at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA>How far out of touch can Senator Gareth Evans be? He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . business is profitable at the moment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>You have only to look at the Yellow Pages index and survey of 1,200 businesses throughout Australia to know that that is not correct. Senator Evans goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business confidence is high at the moment and consumer confidence is high.</PARA>
<PARA>If you talk to small business people, you will find that nothing could be further from the truth. Obviously, the people from Yellow Pages have been talking to small business people and have found that quite the reverse is the situation: small business people have absolutely no confidence in what the government is doing. In the survey, small business people were asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thinking about the current Federal Government&mdash;do you believe that their current economic and other policies are supportive of small business, work against small business or have no real impact either way?</PARA>
<PARA>The overwhelming response was that the policies of the federal government worked against small business. Lack of incentives, high taxes, bureaucracy, lack of understanding, industrial relations policy, government charges and superannuation are just some of the issues that were mentioned, and mentioned very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to page 13 of the Yellow Pages index, where the following question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do you think is the number one national issue that the (Federal) elected government should address?</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment rates as the highest, with 28 per cent. Small business people recognise&mdash;as do I&mdash;that they are one of the greatest creators of employment opportunities. They said that the greatest concern for the federal government or any future federal government would be to get on top of unemployment. On page 7 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Monday 27 November 1995&mdash;the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business perceives the economy as more brittle than a year ago, with profitability slowing, according to the latest survey of its members by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But members of the Victorian Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry provide a more positive outlook in their survey, also released at the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more businesses&mdash;45 per cent&mdash;expect the Victorian economy to experience similarly improved growth during the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trends in employment growth have also improved, according to the VECCI members, despite overall recent adverse job trends in Australia that have been more marked in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA>Due to the strong coalition government in Victoria, things in that state are improving. But business in the rest of Australia perceive that the economy is more brittle than a year ago and that profitability is slowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a travesty that the federal government has created this situation for small business in Australia. It has certainly let small business down. When help was needed during the really tough period when interest rates were escalating, the Labor government failed small business. It failed the community. This is borne out by the massive swing away from the Keating government by the small business sector in Australia, which recognised that when it was in trouble no help was forthcoming from the federal government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I would like to take the opportunity to speak a little bit about higher education places, particularly in Queensland. Having lived in Queensland all of my life, I know what it was like growing up in rather tough times under a National Party government&mdash;or Country Party government as they used to call it in Queensland in those days&mdash;where your chance of going on to tertiary education was almost nil. As a reasonably small boy, only two people that I can remember actually had the opportunity to go on to university education from the struggling backgrounds that we were raised in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that I myself and a lot of people of my generation have had going on to tertiary education as one of the primary objectives for our children. I think we can be very proud of the efforts of this particular government, and certainly it goes back to the Whitlam government as well. In my own family, I have seen my own sons take the opportunity and the advantage of that to study and to work hard to achieve things. But it has all been done through the assistance of a very concerned government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that a lot of people in my Queensland electorate over the weekend spoke to me about their concerns over the Senate's rejection of certain aspects of the government's budget that relate to additional university places for Queensland. When the budget came down in May this year, I sent out a newsletter to my electorate. I will just read some of the relevant points that I made in that newsletter. This is what I said to the electorate on this occasion:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 Commonwealth Budget has provided added impetus to the push for a University Campus in Ipswich by providing $2 million in 1997 to help with the cost of setting up the campus of the University of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Budget proved to be very generous to Queensland in terms of education. Of an extra 5,850 additional higher education places nationwide being funded out of the Budget, 4,200 will go to Queensland. This is in addition to the 500 extra places set aside by the Government in last year's planning for the three year period of funding from 1996-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After many years of lobbying by the Queensland-based Federal Parliamentarians and the Queensland Government, a long-standing imbalance against Queensland in the area of higher education has been addressed in this Budget, which recognises the need for increased opportunities for young people in rapidly growing areas like Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">425 extra places will be provided for the University of Queensland, with the majority of these expected to be set aside for the Ipswich campus.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to focus on the Ipswich campus issue. Ipswich is one of the largest provincial cities in Queensland. It is probably the only provincial city without a university campus, and that is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that previous state governments have not had the commitment to establish a campus in a city the size of Ipswich. I know that my predecessor worked very hard for the campus as well but could not convince the then state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, I have had the opportunity of being a member under a Labor state government which has worked very hard for this. I compliment the Minister for Education in Queensland, David Hamill, for his assistance in this as well. He, I and many others have worked extremely hard to get the acknowledgment of a campus to go into Ipswich. Sadly, I find out that the Senate rejecting the funding bills last week puts at risk this very aspect. It is a major concern to my local community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the parliamentary secretary at the table, the member for Forde, Mary Crawford, also acknowledges that by her interjection of `Shame!' It is a shame on the National-Liberal party opposition. They should be in opposition, and I am sure they will be after the next election. From the way they are carrying on here, you can see that they have no commitment to Queensland whatsoever. For many years the National Party government in Queensland was prepared to go along that same way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the Commonwealth Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), who was prepared to acknowledge the need for more funding and places in Queensland. I mentioned before, in that article that I put out after the budget, the $2 million that has been provided. However, since then another $6.5 million has been allocated for that campus in Ipswich, which shows strong support by the government and its commitment to the establishment of that campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Last week, as soon as I heard about the Senate's rejection of the higher education bill, I put out a statement calling on the Queensland National and Liberal Party senators to cross the floor on this issue, because they ought to if they have any commitment to the state of Queensland whatever. I think we can prove that they have already shown that they do not have any commitment to Queensland. Perhaps the coalition members in this place should also come over and vote with us when the legislation comes back for debate later in the week. I will certainly hop up and speak in support of it. It will affect not only the young people in my electorate but the young people right throughout Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those young people out there today&mdash;I hope they are listening to this debate this afternoon&mdash;who are finishing year 12 this year have a lot of concern about this, because it is going to put at risk those places in Queensland. I can assure them, and I will take the risk of speaking on behalf of all my Labor colleagues, that we are very concerned for their welfare and are working strongly to do something about the matter. Just today, we have joined forces and put out a joint press statement. I congratulate my Labor Party colleagues from Queensland who were prepared to put their names to this joint news release, supporting the government in its push for more places in Queensland. That media release headed `Coalition must reverse block of new uni places' states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland's Labor Senators and Members have demanded that the Federal Coalition reverse its decision to block funding for the State's 4,200 new university places.</PARA>

<PARA>I am certainly joining forces with my colleagues in pushing that line. I am a bit surprised that the Liberal and National Party members in my own electorate have not come out and shown their true colours on this. Or are their true colours hidden, like the federal coalition's policies are? Quite clearly, the city of Ipswich needs a university campus. It is something that we are all fighting for. I challenge all those Liberal and National Party members&mdash;if there are any left around Ipswich&mdash;to come out and show their true colours on this. If they have any decency about them at all, they should take on their own party on this issue. In this press statement, we have gone on to say that we have:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . urged all school-leavers, parents and teachers to phone&mdash;reverse charges&mdash;Liberal and National Party Senators and Members today demanding they pass the Government's legislation which funds the additional places.</PARA>

<PARA>That is all it is. I would urge them all to call any Liberal senators and members they may know around the place. If they want to know who they are, they can certainly let my office know. I am sure that, if they let any other government members' offices know, my colleagues will also push very strongly to assist in highlighting just how hopeless these people are in the coalition, particularly in blocking this funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Australian Democrats and the Greens to also have a bit of concern for Queensland, particularly when it comes to ensuring that that funding legislation is passed by the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The opposition concurs in the recommendations of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), on both issues. The first issue concerns the proposed inquiry into institutional investors. It would seem that, given the circumstances surrounding developments in the Coles Myer company and also in the general field of developments in superannuation, the subject does require careful and deliberate consideration. The obvious challenges in proceeding into this issue make it inappropriate that the inquiry is pursued at this time. All members of the committee believe it appropriate, therefore, that the hearings into the institutional investors should be deferred. We would ask the incoming government to make a similar reference to the successor of this committee in the next parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the matter of the behaviour of corporations in surrounding countries, there is a belief that it is appropriate&mdash;not just in the field of industrial laws but in corporate governance generally&mdash;that there are matters that need to be addressed. They are issues which enable the committee secretariat to collate information which can then be considered and, if necessary, reported on again&mdash;probably in the next parliament. For that reason the members of the coalition support the statement made by the chairman of the committee. We believe that both issues allow some proper and considered investigations in the 34th parliament rather than in this parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I appreciate this brief opportunity to speak on the report. Four members of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund visited New Zealand in August this year at the invitation of the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives and as part of the committee exchange program between our two countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As 1995 is the Maori language year the Speaker, the Hon. Peter Tapsell, indicated that indigenous land rights would be an appropriate topic for an exchange by our committee when we visited New Zealand. The committee's report is a great little report on the committee's deliberations and its fact-finding tour of the North Island of New Zealand, and it is well worth reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee members spent a very busy 3 1/2 days in the North Island almost totally immersed in all aspects of Maori culture. The visit provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to meet everybody involved in Maori affairs&mdash;be they responsible government ministers, parliamentary backbenchers, local Maori women in health centres, operators of Maori FM radio stations, the Maori Queen, young Maori activists or teachers in Maori immersion schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only were we rapidly brought up to speed with the historical background of Maori affairs but we were soon involved in the current and ongoing machinations revolving around Maori land claims resulting from the New Zealand government's $1 billion fiscal envelope offer&mdash;an offer that was made in an attempt to settle the whole issue of Maori land claims once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were fortunate to spend the early part of the trip in the lands of the Waikato-Tainui tribe, who were finalising the details of a settlement with the government. The redress value of the settlement to the Tainui people is to the value of $NZ170 million, with in excess of 29,000 acres of settlement land and an additional 8,000-odd acres of improved land being transferred together with some $NZ60 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as seeing the practical side to the whole issue of land rights, we were fortunate to be taken through the gamut of New Zealand native title. The Treaty of Waitangi, the Maori Land Court, the Waitangi Tribunal, the Office of Treaty Settlements, the Maori Fisheries Act, the Maori Language Act and the Maori Affairs Committee were all explained to us in great detail as we were taken theoretically and practically through the development of land tenure in New Zealand since white settlement. </PARA>

Finally, I would like to express my thanks to the committee members who accompanied me to New Zealand&mdash;especially Senator Chris Evans, the chair of the committee&mdash;and to the committee secretariat, especially Peter Grundy, for the assistance they provided to members and senators during the trip and later for compiling this wonderful report.

The function of government is to raise revenue and appropriate it to competing purposes. That is what the process of politics is all about.

All of those people make particular claims on the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canberra is indeed the clearing house for those various demands and pressures within the political process. Recently we had a good example of this, with a delegation from Geelong visiting Canberra to lobby on behalf of the city and region of Geelong, which I represent in this parliament. That Geelong delegation consisted of Councillor Gerry Smith, the Mayor of the city of Geelong, the Secretary of the Trades Hall Council, John Kranz, and Cathy Roth, the President of the Geelong Chamber of Commerce, representing employers. They were accompanied by two officials, Michael Malouf and Neil Savery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was very well received by senior ministers. I use this opportunity on the floor of the House to thank those ministers for their generosity in consenting to meet the delegation. The delegation was put together in a difficult period. We have recently come through some serious floods in Geelong. The officers were working around the clock dealing with matters relating to the floods and preparing the documentation for the delegation's visit, which had been arranged some time ahead of the floods. It was a magnificent effort. I pay tribute to the staff: Michael Malouf, the CEO of the city of greater Geelong, Neville McPherson, Neil Savery and Richard Walker and all those other people who contributed to the fine documentation that the city was able to present to senior ministers. The community owes them a debt of gratitude. I have had one minister request five copies of the presentation that we made to ministers. He wants to take it back to his own electorate and show his municipalities. That documentation was professionally done and the information was professionally presented to ministers by the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important feature of the government's recent budgetary reallocations has been the funding of the Building Better Cities program. Recently the government allocated some $247 million over a six-year period to this program, $36 million for strategic studies and $200 million to capital grants. Those capital grants can be made to fund infrastructure investment in the form of economic gateways or to finance urban growth centres and redevelopment in areas of high urban growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program has been particularly beneficial to Geelong. As members would know, the Building Better Cities program is organised along area strategy lines. Geelong is situated in the south-west corridor of Victoria for the purposes of the Building Better Cities program. The aims of the strategy in that corridor are to support the growth of areas around Werribee in that corridor and to revitalise the central area of Geelong and its foreshore. There have been some major achievements of the Building Better Cities strategy in the south-west corridor. The completion of the Australian Food and Research Institute in Werribee and the completion of physical infrastructure works around the institute and the technology precinct have been important achievements. We have seen also the upgrading of the Melbourne-Werribee-Geelong railway line and the completion of the Norlane Estate urban redevelopment in Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two projects that are under way and nearing completion are the Deakin wool stores refurbishment and the transport interchange on the Geelong foreshore. It is these two projects to which I would like to make specific reference here because they tie in very neatly with the strategy of the Building Better Cities program to act as catalytic developments for further investment and developments in particular areas. As far as this area of Geelong is concerned, for many years the foreshore development along and around Corio Bay has been almost non-existent. The federal government, in concert with the previous Cain and Kirner governments, was determined that this area could be the focus for a growth strategy and a catalytic development on the Geelong foreshore area. It has indeed done that. The Deakin wool stores and the transport interchange areas have been the catalyst for further study and development of that foreshore area. The current state government in Victoria has allocated some $20 million to foreshore development and the private developments in the area are anticipated over a number of years to be in excess of $200 million. It all started from the Building Better Cities program funded by a Labor government and two strategically placed developments on the Geelong foreshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of these projects have been substantial in Geelong. We have seen the creation of employment in the building industry. Local firms have been involved in the construction of these projects. They have strengthened these enterprises in an economic sense and given them some expertise in handling larger projects. Furthermore, Geelong suppliers have benefited greatly from the purchases of local contractors who have been involved in the project. The overall benefit to the Geelong community has been the regeneration of this area of the foreshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to a rather sad element of this development, and that is the criticisms that have been levelled at it in the Better Cities program by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). He has attempted in press releases to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS> and other media outlets to denigrate this program. He recently claimed in a press release that the Auditor-General ought to investigate the Building Better Cities program on the basis that the funding went to Labor electorates. In the Geelong region it would be a little tough for me to locate the Geelong transport interchange over the other side of the Barwon River in his electorate or to transfer the Deakin wool stores building over the other side of the Barwon River so we could even up the score as far as the Building Better Cities program and the funding in particular electorates were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Building Better Cities program has been of great benefit to the workers of Geelong and to the Geelong economy. I am disappointed by the criticisms of the program that have been levelled by the honourable member for Corangamite. He needs to take himself down to those building sites and talk to the building workers whose families have benefited from the employment that the breadwinner has had on those sites and to the people of Geelong about the great benefits that have flowed from this catalytic development on the foreshore. In excess of $250 million, if we can get the foreshore projects up and running, will have flowed from a strategic Commonwealth investment in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the Geelong delegation to which I referred who were recently here in Canberra and who lobbied the federal government for several projects for funding under the Building Better Cities mark 2 program, several projects have been tabled with the government. I hope that ministers give them serious consideration. We have tabled projects for funding: a geographical information system, the refurbishment of the Eastern Gardens, the Boulevard restoration project, the Whittington link project and the Corio Bay foreshore management project. All those are worth while and can stand on their own two feet as far as evaluation is concerned under the programs that are already in place. The base studies have already been done. These are not projects for funding that the city of greater Geelong or the community has dreamed up. They are concrete and real, based on some excellent studies that have been done on this area in Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wholeheartedly support the Building Better Cities 2 program and the funding that has been made available for economic gateways and the refurbishment and regeneration of urban areas in major cities. It is a program that has delivered real and lasting benefits to local communities. It has acted as a stimulus for a far greater amount of public and private infrastructure investment in particular areas. It has been a strong generator of employment and a program of great community benefit. I commend the program to the House. </PARA>

In spite of a whole raft of legislation that we have enacted to make elections fairer and politicians more accountable, it has been necessary to put forward that notice of motion. The remarkable thing is that nothing has been done as a result of it. In other words, there is a lesser standard for a politician in relation to truth in marketing a product than there is for companies and enterprises outside. </PARA>

We also have more exposure to the media so that politicians' private lives are part and parcel of the daily fight in this place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a politician representing an area of some 60,000 square kilometres, I think that one vote, one value deprives a voter, a constituent, in country and huge electorates such as Kalgoorlie, Grey, Dawson or Kennedy. Politicians are not the ones being denied because their time and services are available to the extent they can give them in 24 hours. But constituents well out of the mainstream, not in a major community or town, have to use a telephone to communicate. That means time and cost, as does sending a letter, which also means delays. They have to wait until they can come face to face with their politician or they have to travel to communicate with a Commonwealth department centred in Townsville, Brisbane or Sydney. There is open access to constituents who live in those areas but outback people are denied justice. </PARA>

As a practising accountant at the time I came to this place, I was devastated to realise that the tax act was contained in two volumes and was quite thick. I believe that you need simplicity in taxation if you are going to expect the constituents, the taxpayers, to pay their fair amount. We have seen in this House that at the last budget that tax act grew to four or five times the size it had been.

They are not succeeding in doing so because of the complexity of the tax act and all the other regulations we find in front of us. I was interested to read in the letters to the editor in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> this morning that, when everybody is talking about equal pay for equal work, a small business person who starts at five in the morning and ends at 11 at night wants to know when they are going to be paid a fair amount for equal work, as applies with the unions. </PARA>

It is very important. It refers to tax deductibility of legal expenses. I have found a problem within my constituency and within the Australian public as a whole that banks, large insurance institutions and insurance companies, knowing that they can get tax deductibility for their litigation expenses, use that advantage mercilessly on a litigant who has not the same fund of money and who cannot claim expenses as a tax deduction.

Every so often, a major contractor will go broke and, at the same time, leave a raft of subcontractors, builders suppliers and employers of workers unable to collect on that debt. It has no preference under the Bankruptcy Act. In fact, it gets worse than that. If a subcontractor or material supplier for a major contractor gets a payment within six months of the bankruptcy, they are forced to class that as a preferred payment and pay it back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 12 months, this has happened in Mackay on two occasions. One was an entirely private arrangement, where the subcontractors missed out. A comparison of the employment record of small business and big business shows that the fallout is tremendous as far as unemployment is concerned. It brought to my mind once again the problems that exist. If the building industry drops dramatically after a period of prosperity or a boom, within two or three months you can expect to see a whole category of bankruptcies and liquidations where only the local people suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the other example is more important. A person was contracting for Q-Build, which is a state department. The client was a state department with money in hand. Obviously they did not have protection and they did not care to exercise it. When they paid the contractor, the subbies should also have been paid. As a result, once the contract was finished, the contractor had liabilities of $327,000, for which he had assets of about $20,000. As a result, all those subcontractors and suppliers of material and services also had to go to the wall. Despite this happening recently, I remember three years ago writing to the same minister in connection with the same department asking what protections he had put in place. He gave me a whole raft of assurances, but nothing came of it to the extent that it is still happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news in this regard is that this year the Joint Committee on Public Works undertook to have every contract involving any Commonwealth department as a client state that subcontractors be paid a progress payment and that, unless there is evidence to that effect, no payment be made to the contractor. I am happy to say that I was given an assurance that that happens not only with contracts of $6 million or more that the Joint Public Works Committee examines but also with every other contract that the Commonwealth enters into. If that is the record, payments may be slow. If payments are made, that is great. But that has not been happening with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We undertook as a Public Works Committee to talk to the state public works committees about this matter. It would probably be of no surprise to the members here to realise that even the client, being the state, in a preferred position did not insist on those subcontractual arrangements. We also found that only one state has legislation of any type that gives some protection, and that is Queensland. It was found that, in its own way, that legislation could be manoeuvred around and made ineffectual. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also heartened by the response of one organisation in Australia that seems to have its feet on the ground as far as this is concerned. Bisco, which is in New South Wales, has set out to supply a formula that not only secures payments to the contractor and eventually the subcontractor but also, before the contract is put into place, provides security for payment which involves the client, the financier and the builder. There is an insistence that that money is in place so that a bankruptcy will not occur because of a lack of funds. It also insists that the subcontractors are looked at in detail so that they can be paid from the funds out of progress payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people go further than just look at the normal argument of a subcontractor beefing against a contractor or a construction person. They have looked at security for payment across the board. The architect, the supplier of material, the subcontractor and the service provider all get a say. The security of payment which flows from that says that the contractor must, on payment, pay the subcontractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dispute resolution is very much a part of it, because at this stage dispute resolution is an absolute myth. It can go on for years and years. A particular report in New South Wales proved the fact that building costs in Australia are at least two per cent more than they should be because of the bad debt factor, and almost another one per cent more because of slow payment by contractors to the subbies. If it can be put in place, this would be a marvellous way of doing something for small business in Australia. Nothing exemplifies more the small business character in Australia than all those service subbies and contractors across Australia. </PARA>

It is writing to subcontractors and contractors to say that if they register their name with the organisation for a fee of $175 it will place them on a preferment list for state and Commonwealth contracts. You would think it was a state or Commonwealth department imposing yet another fee. It is a private organisation rendering an account for $175 by saying that registration is obligatory.

If anybody now has an argument about British involvement in their affairs, it is the European Union.

The government had to react against a UN treaty in order to implement its own sovereignty. It is happening in many other ways. If we have a problem in this country, irrespective of whether we are a republic or a monarchy, how we deal with that problem depends on the manner in which we are beholden as a sovereign country to the United Nations.

Perhaps there is a case to be made for this deal, but if there is it should be made by the government and this deal should not be snuck through, as it were, buried in a vast appropriation bill. </PARA>

There is much to commend in all that, but the fact is that this government has reduced tariffs on manufacturing industry, damaging the battlers, the small businesses and the workshops involved. It has reduced subsidies for agriculture, damaging and hurting many of Australia's small farmers. It has practised a form of wage restraint, inflicting on some of Australia's poorest paid workers lower real wages today than they had in 1976. It has done all of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has shunned the search to pick winners when picking winners might have benefited the worst off in our society, yet it is strangely anxious to pick winners when we are talking about a business controlled by one of the world's richest men.

We are told by the government that this venture is going to provide lots of jobs for Australia's fine young actors and actresses. Well, maybe it will, but very few of them will be acting in movies and television productions. Most of them, if they are to get jobs in this venture, will be selling tickets and drinks because this is essentially a theme park, not a movie studio. </PARA>

Dreamworld on the Gold Coast was, I believe, recently in the hands of a receiver. Let us look at Movieworld on the Gold Coast.

There is a hint of John Bannon and the State Bank of South Australia about this.

Edna Carew, the Prime Minister's biographer, has talked about those long love-ins with the press gallery, those long gallery crawls of years ago when he would go through the gallery repeatedly, alternately soft-soaping the journalists and threatening them with all sorts of terrible fates if they did not say the things he liked. </PARA>

It shows on the part of the government complete contempt for the modus operandi of the company.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, Quayside Pty Ltd was established for a joint  venture development between the Frankston City Council and Galvin Construction Group Pty Ltd. Council's contribution to the joint venture was the land upon which the Quayside Shopping Centre is now built. The land was valued at $25 million and council acquired a 49 per cent equity in Quayside Pty Ltd by virtue of taking up 49 ordinary fully paid $1 shares. Quayside Pty Ltd borrowed $75 million from the Commonwealth Bank to build the shopping centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 I expressed my concerns that Frankston City Council was unwise in committing itself to the joint venture to the extent that it did. Since this time many constituents have also expressed a similar concern to me. The fundamental issue is the fact that the residents and ratepayers of Frankston were exposed to a multimillion dollar loss of assets. At first glance it appears that Frankston city has already lost land valued at $13 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of avenues have been exhausted in an attempt to establish the true situation regarding council's involvement in the joint venture and the extent of the financial risk to which the residents and ratepayers of Frankston have been exposed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A group of concerned local residents, which has considerable financial expertise, has made representations to the Victorian auditor-general, the Victorian ombudsman and the Victorian parliament's public accounts and estimates committee. However, not much information has been provided by the commissioners of the city of Frankston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday, 17 November this year the commissioners announced that under a settlement with the Commonwealth Bank the joint venture with the Galvin Construction Group is being wound up. They said that the Frankston City Council would therefore suffer a one-off capital loss of the land contributed as its share of the joint venture in 1988, together with some administrative and legal costs, bringing its involvement in the project to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioners also said that they had agreed to the sale of Central Park and the Young Street car park as part of the settlement, the ultimate need for this sale being subject to the outcome of the sale of Quayside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision by the commissioners raises many questions. The most fundamental question has to do with the commissioners' ability to place Central Park on the property market. Central Park, which was previously known as Lawrey's Paddock, was sold to the former shire of Frankston and Hastings in February 1945. It is common knowledge around Frankston that the land was acquired on the condition that it be kept for public use as a park and garden.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, despite many efforts I have been unable to locate a copy of the contract of sale, which would have verified its having at least 19 conditions attached to it. As I said in a previous speech, I have a solicitor's letter which mentions the 19th condition of the contract of sale of Lawrey's Paddock. What were the other 18 conditions? Were there any more conditions? We do not know. The contract of sale is not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the current chief executive officer of Frankston city concedes that even he cannot find the contract of sale document. One has to wonder at how a document providing details of the purchase of a piece of land which in 1945 was, and in 1995 still is, the most significant piece of land in Frankston city can be misplaced. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> What we are seeing here with this calling of a quorum is the stifling of free speech&mdash;exactly the same as happens in Nazi Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the conditions attached to the sale of Lawrey's Paddock created a burden on the land which may be enforceable in equity. I have tried to get the commissioners to act and save Central Park. They have known my views for a long time. They have decided in secret and in collusion with others to sell off the land that belongs to the people of Frankston without once putting forward the reason why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who gave them the right to do this? Who appointed them? Well, we all know who it was: it was Jeffrey Gibb Kennett. These people will get their $60,000 to $100,000 per year and other perks for the next year or so, sell our assets and then just walk away. They will leave a city bereft of a green Central Park, a city without a living, breathing heart. Frankston will become an extension of some shopping magnate's portfolio. Therefore, I do not believe that the commissioners have the moral right nor the legal right to place this land on the property market. I do not blame the commissioners for the mess our city is in. The blame lies with the former council officers and the people they hired for advice. Of course, the councillors of the time should share the blame. Only two objected to the involvement of the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another act of incompetence occurred in relation to the cultural centre. Even in Monopoly, a game most children play, you cannot put a house on mortgaged land. However, the stupidity of council officers and advisers allowed the Frankston Cultural Centre to be built on mortgaged land. Any 10-year-old child could have told them it should not be done. I have a question. Why did the Commonwealth Bank allow them to build on mortgaged land? Was it allowed by the bank to be able to put more leverage on the council in relation to Quayside?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioners keep patting themselves on the back on their good economic management. They claim a surplus of approximately $5 million. Central Park is worth probably $3 million to $4 million top. Surely we can pay out the mortgage instead of the bank collaborating with, apparently, the owners of Quayside to expand a shopping empire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have many questions about the financial details regarding the settlement agreed to by the commissioners. I call upon the Victorian Minister for Local Government to immediately initiate an inquiry into all matters regarding the settlement agreed to by the commissioners. I urge the minister to demand immediate answers to the following questions. The loan facility with the Commonwealth Bank is not due to be repaid or refinanced until 30 June 2001 and the next scheduled catch-up interest payment of $4.6 million is not due until 30 June 1996. Therefore, why have the commissioners agreed to the liquidation of the joint venture given that, according to the due diligence report, which they themselves requested the auditor-general to conduct, Frankston city has no liability for $4.6 million catch-up payment, and money is still available in the sinking fund to service the loan facility into the new year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have the commissioners stated that they are unable to contribute further funds to the venture when Frankston City's chief executive officer has said publicly that `evidence of council's financial strength' includes investments of $13.8 million; that the due diligence report, carried out on instruction from the commissioners, states that `there are significant funds totalling $8.6 million available to the city which can be redirected'; and that Frankston City's 1995-96 budget, released by the commissioners, reveals that for 1995-96 a gross operating surplus of $5.170 million is expected following an actual gross operating surplus of $14.388 million in 1994-95? It has the money. Why does it not just buy out the mortgage? This is the question that should be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have the commissioners agreed to the payment of an additional $9.3 million in break costs in 1995 if this payment does not solve the problem of the $4.6 million balloon payment during 1996? Why have the commissioners agreed to $9.3 million being added to the debt now, thereby increasing the total debt to $93 million, when the loan is not due to be repaid or refinanced until 2001? Why have the commissioners agreed to the forced sale of Quayside when the loan facility does not terminate until 2001 and Quayside is widely recognised&mdash;including by the commissioners&mdash;as a desirable investment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have the commissioners sought legal advice regarding the burden on the Central Park site which appears to have been created by conditions included in the contract of sale when the land was sold to Frankston? Why did Commissioner McCoy not disclose that break costs of $9.3 million had been incurred on 30 June 1995, thereby increasing the total debt to $93 million, when 17 days later he is reported as saying that negotiations were `drawing to a close'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the Victorian Minister for Local Government has stated in correspondence to me that `at no time has it been suggested that council should acquire the debts of the company', and given that the effects of deed entered into by the commissioners will be for Frankston City Council to underwrite the losses of Quayside Pty Ltd, has the minister properly fulfilled his obligations, or have the commissioners misled him too?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that Frankston City has no liability for the $9.3 million break costs which have increased the amount owed to the Commonwealth Bank, why did the commissioners agree to the break costs? Why are the commissioners entering into this deed at a time when Frankston City's exposure is capped at a maximum of the land mortgaged to the bank, valued we think at $10.8 million, and the Auditor-General's agent reports in the due diligence report that Frankston City does not have a proportional share of Quayside's liability? Our liability is the land. Why are we expected to pay any more?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the previous council disclose to the federal government when it donated $3 million to Frankston City Council for the cultural centre that the site for the cultural centre was mortgaged to the Commonwealth Bank?

But would the Commonwealth have given it this $3 million if it had known the cultural centre was to be built on mortgaged land?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that any such non-disclosure may have constituted misrepresentation, why did the commissioners specifically exclude `legal exposure relating to potential actions' from the terms of reference when it commissioned the due diligence report?

What are the basic terms of the swap agreement? Why was the swap agreement terminated? On whose advice was the swap terminated?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Monday in answer to a dorothy dixer about competition policy from Milton Friedman's love child, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. George Gear&mdash;who is probably his surrogate uncle&mdash;basked in the triumph of free market policies in the ALP. All the old icons&mdash;the Industry Commission, the Hilmer report and the national competition policy&mdash;were wheeled out by the Assistant Treasurer. All this from the same person who attempts vainly to convince us that the free market policies of the government are in no way driving the sale of public utilities. I would like to believe that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bet if you asked the minister to categorically oppose the sale of electricity and gas down in Victoria, he would not be so gung-ho. I bet he would get the shakes if you put that question to him. Nor would the member for Werriwa who, if he is not a Tory rat, is surely a closet Tory. If he has not been a member of the coalition in this life, he must surely have been one in another life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer blithely endorsed competition policy, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the Hilmer report is splitting the labour movement as much as it is driving a wedge between the Liberals and the Nationals. The only way the ALP acolytes can defend their competition policy is by way of comparison with the so-called economic protectionism of the former Country Party leader Black Jack McEwen. The ALP Right is forced to resurrect McEwen because the devotion of both parties to free market policies is so transparent that targets are getting harder to find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just about every problem modern Australia faces is traced back to McEwen, who has become even more sinister in Labor mythology than Bob Menzies. This shows how vacuous and a-historical the Modern Right's view of the world actually is. Pig-Iron Bob Menzies, whose commitment to free trade in the 1930s made him a pin-up boy with the Japanese warmongers and whose attempts to destroy the communists in the 1950s made him a hero with reactionaries, could almost get a gig in the anti-collectivist right wing of the ALP in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP's use of retrospective morality and historical amnesia to defend an essentially New Right agenda is galling and intellectually deceitful. We never see the ALP right wing devotees of globalism citing the vote on the motion to decriminalise homosexuality moved by John Gorton in 1973 as an example of the reactionary origins of the present coalition. The noes included: Katter Sr, Beazley Sr, Billy Wentworth and Keating P.J. The ayes included: Crean Sr, Jenkins Sr, Staley and Sinclair. How about that for a weird political vote!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the revisionists would like to give us a theory about the state of mind of the current Prime Minister, the modernist P.J. Keating, 22 years ago and what that has to do with his policies today. To ascribe the birth of protectionism to Black Jack McEwen as if other countries did not practice and still do not practice it is plain stupid. To claim that the modern coalition is protectionist again is plain stupid. Funny about that&mdash;don't we all remember the current Prime Minister describing the Leader of the Opposition as Captain Zero prior to the 1993 general election? What a transformation there must have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fact which the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) is keen to have made public, one the revisionists on the other side of the House should know, is that it was Jack McEwen who in 1957 established a trade treaty with Japan. Given the hostility towards Japan which existed in Australia at the time, it would probably qualify as a radical decision. Essentially, it involved the Japanese removing tariffs on Australian wool and quotas on beef in return for Australia abolishing a discriminatory tariff on Japanese imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, it might interest the revisionists to know that it was the ALP and some in the RSL who voted against Japanese trade. Arthur Calwell went absolutely feral not long after this. It was the likes of Fred Daly, Arthur Calwell and Jim Cairns who voiced their opposition to McEwen's 1968 Customs Tariff Bill, a bill to classify industries according to whether they fell into high, medium or low tariff areas. In the eyes of the Labor diehards of the time, McEwen was beginning to act like a free trader. No matter what the right wing acolytes want to argue, everyone in this house knows that Daly, Calwell and Cairns were neither stupid nor dishonourable. They were interested in the jobs of working people and, dare I say it, the economic sovereignty of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days no-one talks about real economic sovereignty and if they do fall on the question they seem to want to argue that replacing the monarchy with a republic will automatically bring about cultural and economic independence. The fact that our industries are being confiscated by foreign capital at a rate of knots is never mentioned. Even today, despite what Paul Keating says about APEC, Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia refuses to give unequivocal support to the removal of trade barriers, the American government continues to substantially subsidise agricultural production and the Prime Minister admits that barriers, tariff and non-tariff, continue to be a serious obstacle to so-called trade liberalisation. How many countries can we cite throughout history who have removed trade barriers to their own detriment? Certainly not the Asian tigers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), whom I know is forced to do the government's free trade bidding, must surely have trouble keeping a straight face when he tells us that the export of elaborately transformed manufactures is compensating for the loss of the domestic market. The parliamentary secretary knows that imports have gone&mdash;to use the Prime Minister's expression&mdash;gangbusters and the increase of exports of ETMs has been from a minuscule base. The problem with our approach is that it has been basically unilateral, leaving local manufacturers to compete on a playing field that is not level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot even institute social clauses into current trading arrangements. It is all very well to condemn child labour but try to do something about it and the free traders will not have a bar of it. The response from the big players such as CRA is to further deregulate the labour market and drive down wage costs. The problem is that the deregulating of the labour market and the legitimising of non-union labour started with this government and the concept of enterprise bargaining. On this score, the ACTU has a lot to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government is committed to pure competition, why does it protect Optus by circumscribing the charges its competitor, Telstra, can levy on domestic calls? Competition ideologues&mdash;the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Werriwa, to name two&mdash;cite lower international and STD calls in Australia ad nauseam as the consequence of competition policy. The truth is that technology, not so-called competition, is the reason for any improvement in services. Kenneth Davidson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 15 April 1995 went as far as to claim that Australian telephone charges are eight per cent over the OECD average and are so because of Austel's desire to see Optus survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government is so committed to pure competition, why does it allow the public infrastructure of Telstra&mdash;infrastructure paid for by the taxpayer&mdash;to be used by Rupert Murdoch's Foxtel virtually scot-free? The truth is that Murdoch's pay TV juggernaut&mdash;a service we do not need and one that will not enhance cultural life one iota&mdash;is going to be funded out of the public purse. Murdoch's conquest of rugby league is not the by-product of free enterprise or competition policy. It is the action of a robber baron urged on by a compliant emperor who reckons he is a republican. Well may my good friend the member for Werriwa say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rupert Murdoch's aggressive move into the Australian market for sport content should be marked out as a first order concern for regulators.</PARA>
<PARA>For as his ideological mate, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), retorts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given his propensity to argue for market forces and competition to rein in many other areas in the economy, I suspect that the allocation of codes between one media owner and another could be more difficult to implement, despite the honourable motives that are, no doubt behind it.</PARA>
<PARA>Allowing a Murdoch takeover of rugby league in the name of competition is one thing; allocating $32 million towards the cost of building a Fox pay television empire at the Sydney showgrounds is another. This appropriation bill allocates $32 million to the New South Wales government, $27 million of which is for the relocation of the Royal Agricultural Society and $7 million of which is for infrastructure costs associated with the establishment of the Fox film studios at the Sydney Showgrounds. On top of that, the state government will grant tax concessions to Fox of more than $7 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder New South Wales Independent MP Clover Moore described this as `a $70 million leg-up for a billionaire company'. If this is a government which believes in competition and is dead against the kind of subsidies Jack McEwen dished out, why is it handing over a fistful of battler money to the Murdoch empire? Why is the opposition, which wants to quibble about Carmen Lawrence's costs in relation to the witch-hunt in WA, not attacking the obscene handout to Rupert Murdoch?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only one coalition member, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), and a former member, the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), speaking on this appropriation bill have raised the issue of the Murdoch subsidy. I must say that the member for Warringah certainly was not about to badmouth his former employer. Put this subsidy in the context of the infrastructure needs of the communities in the former Labor heartlands and all the guff about support for competition and opposition to subsidies becomes a joke. In a time of great need this government has refused to spend money in the heartlands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One-off local capital grants gave us a leisure centre here and there back in 1993 but swimming is no substitute for a job. These capital grants, of course, were not revived in subsequent budgets. If the sort of money dished out to Murdoch was allocated to Sydney road refurbishment or to a community music centre in Brunswick, for example, we in the northern suburbs could create serious jobs and invigorate cultural life. Does our arts aficionado Prime Minister seriously believe that a Fox studio in Sydney will enhance the cultural life of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And what of the jobs? Is this venture about jobs or about a Disneyland fun parlour and a cheap pay television assembly line that will do little for, if not harm, the Australian film industry? When the Murdoch owned <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> set about destroying the last Victorian ALP government the Labor movement was so outraged that it attempted to mobilise a movement to boycott the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> newspaper. Haven't things changed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than lampooning the past by way of retrospective morality and childish empiricism, the revisionists should be asking why this federal government is so obsequious in its dealings with the Murdoch empire and media moguls in general. It is a bit of a shame that I could not ask these questions earlier in the debate. Maybe then the spokespersons of the Right could have filed into the chamber to answer some of the questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ALP Right is dead against tariffs on the grounds that they are an inefficient means of allocating resources and a tax on workers, how do they justify pork-barrelling the Murdoch empire? Only someone who rats on Labor principles could defend this blatant misuse of the taxpayers' hard-earned money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal bill of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is only a drop in the ocean by comparison. I have heard all the arguments as to why the minister should not receive Commonwealth funding, but they really have the terrible ring of partisan politics about them. If we adopted the coalition's position on this question, ministers would be totally vulnerable, open to all kinds of manipulation and subject to compromise. Quibbling about the issue is just another example of the selective morality which dominates this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more to the point is why John Halden was so enthusiastic about lodging the Easton petition in the Western Australian parliament. Doesn't he sound like a really decent kind of bloke? We have all heard about Senator Baume's predilection for personal attacks but, fair dinkum, Halden makes him look like an angel. I know that the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) will argue that John Halden had no option and that in any case it is not necessary to disassociate oneself from a petition. Everyone accepts that this explanation misses the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure there is any number of people in this House who would have avoided lodging that petition or would have completely disassociated themselves from the petition. John Halden was not just a willing accomplice in the production of this petition; he was an agitator and an urger. I cannot believe that anyone would seriously argue that poor old John Halden was the ham in the sandwich. Everyone knows it was a classic piece of political payback and the sort of activity that only discredits the parliament. What is worse is that the minute one side does it the other side sanctimoniously shouts, `Shame! shame!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter)&mdash;who sits behind me&mdash;accused the former senator Graham Richardson of knocking around with the bad end of town and the like, ALP members were the first to attack his integrity. It was the same when the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) tipped a bucket on a couple of public servants. I did not fancy that either. Didn't the ALP go ballistic when that happened? But when it was one of their own using the privilege of parliament it was another matter. That is one reason why the vote for Independents will continue to increase&mdash;not because there is anything special about being an Independent, but rather that there is something unsavoury about being a tribal party hack. Being a party hack and behaving like that is not particularly global, either. We often talk about being inward looking&mdash;well, the actions of John Halden were inward looking; they were not the product of someone who was into universal ideas or who had a global view of the world. They were the actions of someone driven by a partisan payback regime that does nothing but discredit this parliament and other parliaments in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, as you come from Victoria, you would be aware that the commissars are now running local government in Victoria. It is a state where you have to have a political allegiance before you can be appointed to a hospital board or before you can be appointed to a water board. In fact, before you can do almost anything in public life in Victoria you must be a member of the Liberal Party, a member of the National Party or favourably known to such people&mdash;to the extent now that the Kennett government has hunted out and got rid of people in the rural areas who are not friendly to the Liberal Party. For example, in Castlemaine people of strong community involvement have been thrown off the hospital board because they were not politically correct, and Jeffrey Kennett did not like that. On the Seymour hospital board, people who did not even apply for vacancies were appointed. This is the sort of thing which we now accept as common practice in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that the rights of individuals have been taken away. The constitution has been changed more often by this state government than in any previous time in Victoria's political history. By a simple majority vote in the Victorian parliament, the Kennett government removed the rights of people to access the judicial system. I want this House to think about that. There is nothing more serious than removing the rights of ordinary citizens to access the courts of our land. Yet this is common practice and is occurring more regularly than in any other state in Australia under the Kennett government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day in this House I made comments concerning the chief commissioner of Victoria. At the time I made those comments there were common stories in Victoria both in the police force and elsewhere about how Mr Comrie gained employment. I had a good chat with the police commissioner today. He assured me and I accept totally that his appointment was quite above board and that there was no involvement by other people in his applying for the position of chief commissioner and obtaining that position. When I made the comments in this House I stated, and believe very firmly, that he is a man of integrity and of high moral character. That has been borne out further, because in my discussions with the chief commissioner today he clarified a few matters with me. He also mentioned that he did not sign a Kennett contract. One was put in front of him and he refused to sign it. As far as I am concerned, that puts Neil Comrie way up there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that if a chief commissioner were to sign a Kennett work contract the separation of powers would be breached. That is what is happening in Victoria. Senior people sign individual work contracts and are no longer independent as statutory appointments or senior public servants. Rather, because they are on contract they are under the control and whim of Kennett ministers. I find that absolutely appalling. But I am more than pleased to find that our chief commissioner refused to sign such a contract. As he said, he did not do so because that would have meant a breach of the doctrine of the separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in my view Victoria is in safe hands with our chief commissioner. He is a person who applied for the position, earnt it on his own merits and deserves that position. However, that does not take away from the disastrous nature of what the Liberal Party and the National Party are doing in Victoria to destroy the doctrine of the separation of powers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in question time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a comment which I found personally offensive in that he made snide remarks about the Burke government. I was a big critic of the Burke government, mainly on matters of style. I do not believe the Burke government was corrupt. We had a $30 million royal commission set up that broke every rule of due process and fairness and that at the end of the day found there was no corruption in the government. People went to gaol arising out of that corruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take up the cause of Ray O'Connor, one time leader of the Liberal people, who I believe was very unfairly gaoled. He was charged with receiving a cheque. I will not have time to read it all but I have here a letter from Brian Tennant, who is a social law reform campaigner in Western Australia. He is very well known and, it is conceded, takes a very keen interest in this sort of thing and does a good job. I want to deal here with the judge's statement and his summing up. His Honour said, with regard to cheques:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`So there is no evidence as to the cheque. There can't be. There was no longer existing any evidence as to what the deposit slip said in relation to that cheque. There is nothing on the face of the cheque itself to say what account it went into'&mdash;it makes one wonder.</PARA>
<PARA>His Honour goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Any lies that Mr O'Connor, if he did tell lies, and I would suggest to you that he did not . . . I would think that you should be very reluctant and slow to be able to draw any inference that Mr O'Connor is guilty because he told lies . . . There is no evidence as to what happened to the National Bank cheque drawn by the Bond Corporation. We don't know positively that it was the cheque attached to Mr Buckley's memo. There is no evidence of the cheque coming into Mr Connor's possession. Nobody said they saw the cheque handed to Mr O'Connor and Mr O'Connor had denied it. There was no evidence that the cheque was banked.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no need for Mr O'Connor to steal $25,000 to pay his income tax assessment because he made the necessary financial arrangements with his banker. There is no evidence that the cheque was banked on the 19th April and if the cheque was for a campaign account, nobody ever checked the Labor Party accounts to see if it was deposited there.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on. The judge's references here clearly are saying to the jury: `It is too dangerous to convict.' I would say to this House that the reason Mr O'Connor got convicted was not the evidence. The evidence should have exonerated him. He was convicted because of the feeding frenzy built up over this whole WA Inc. royal commission. It was a feeding frenzy which was prompted very much by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just add that, while I was a critic of the Burke government on matters of style, it ought to be on the record that the Burke government's financial record was very good. It was second only to the state of Queensland. The reason that the Labor Party in Queensland was able to do so well is because Bjelke-Petersen left every government instrumentality with hollow logs stuffed with money. So in Western Australia we had enormous benefits arising from the Burke government's handling of the collapse of the stock market in time. In relation to the Burke government bailing out Rothwells, it should also be remembered that they were acting on the advice of the auditor; they were acting on the advice of those people deemed to know something about cash flow, people like Bond and Holmes a Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to Senator Crichton-Browne's credit that he said to me that you would never hear a word out of him because in his view any government would have acted that way and if it happened again governments would do it all over again. He was, of course, quite right. Unlike many other people in the Liberal Party, Crichton-Browne kept his word. I could go on at length on the judge's view on this trial. I believe that Ray O'Connor deserves a new trial and, if I were Mr O'Connor, I would certainly have it before a judge because juries in this emotional state cannot be relied upon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of Australia's 4,500 newsagencies&mdash;4,500 businesses that employ 20,000 staff and contribute $3 billion worth of turnover to the national accounts. In the main, they are family businesses. Newsagencies add to our community, to the viability of shopping centres. If you take them away, you damage those shopping centres and all the businesses in that community. They offer community value because often the centrepiece and the character of your shopping centre is set by the tone of the newsagent. He is there at the crack of dawn delivering his papers and he is there most nights when the shops are closed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Newsagencies offer significant public benefit. They do this through access to information at a low cost. They provide a significant range of magazines. This cannot be guaranteed under a different system. This system is viable because of its low cost&mdash;and it works. To change or modify it will destroy it and Australians will lose access to our news media. </PARA>

If that current system was to end, you would have to deal with three or four different delivering agencies which could not provide that sort of service for anywhere near that cost. We would end up talking about monopolies and restrictions on the access of all Australians to the news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Newsagencies provide a service and they do it at great cost to themselves. The average newsagent works 80, 90 or 100 hours a week. I am perhaps the only member of this House qualified to speak on this because my family owned newsagencies for 25 years. We delivered every day that we were charged with; and we delivered as a family business. By doing so, we built a rapport with our community that, dare I say it, helped me in the Canberra by-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am here tonight to say that the coalition supports the continuation of the current system of distribution for newspapers and magazines with one accredited newsagency for a particular territory. We believe that this system provides a significant public benefit in its provision of a low cost, effective home delivery service for daily morning newspapers, as well as facilitating the widespread availability of a broad range of publications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the main, these family businesses do this with low profit margins. Anything that disturbs those territories that underlie these newsagencies will disturb the whole viability of a significant sector of Australian small businesses. The coalition recognises that successful small business enterprises such as newsagencies are the base from which our national recovery must be built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to this House that we should all support the newsagency system because, in the main, these ladies and gentlemen provide an honest, decent service and they do it at great personal expense in terms of the time they put in and the amount of investment they have tied up in it. Any undercutting of the certainty of the territories will destroy a particular and definite public benefit. It is up to this House to ensure that the Trade Practices Commission guarantees the rights of all newsagents to survive in their current form and guarantees the rights of all Australians to have access to their news media. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express my anger and frustration at the continuing habit of Senator Campbell of using my name, quoting me falsely and imputing false conclusions on what I have been saying in recent months around Australia. Back in June I had the privilege of tabling a report on aspects of youth homelessness from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a major document and requires detailed and complex understanding. Because of that I wrote to the minister and requested him to delay his response as it was important for the community to read and respond to the report. Since then we have had public forums in most cities&mdash;Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane Alice Springs Darwin and, last week, Newcastle. These forums have allowed people in the community to understand the report and to go to its detail. The responses coming from the community have been quite substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell keeps insisting that the government promised to respond in three months. He constantly attacks the government for delaying the response&mdash;and uses my name in the process. He knows that I have stated publicly on more than one occasion that I asked the minister not to respond too promptly because that would not give time for the community input which is so important. So he is aware of what I said and he is aware of what the minister was asked to do. For him to continue in this way is quite reprehensible. It indicates a lack of understanding and empathy for the youth sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is also aware, as the report points out, that the major issues involved are essentially state issues. The Commonwealth has some responsibility, but it is primarily with the states. It is important to go to the dimensions of this problem in order to understand it. As at the last week in May last year, on the best figures available&mdash;from David MacKenzie and Chris Chamberlain, who are now accepted as being the most reliable sources of data&mdash;some 30,000 young Australians under the age of 18 were notionally homeless, not living with their families or in a secure relationship. Of them, just over 20,000 were receiving the young homeless allowance. In other words, one-third of these young people were not being paid at the homeless rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That gives a lie to the claims by many that the homeless allowance has acted as an incentive to and has encouraged children to leave home. The report nailed that one very firmly and clearly. At the same time, the report also pointed out that in 1992-93 there were substantiated cases of abuse against 22,300 young Australians in that year, a figure which is horrific in its dimensions. It is a figure which is also greater than the number of people receiving homeless allowance. So each year a greater number of neglect and abuse cases are being produced than currently receive the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people who have been going around the countryside in recent weeks talking about the allowance as an incentive are apologists for abusers. What they are doing and saying is covering up child abuse, pretending it is not occurring and blaming the children who are the victims of these breakdowns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a superb cartoon in the newspaper last week showing a man and a woman in a boxing ring with boxing gloves on. Beside them was a child being carried out on a stretcher. The child is the real victim of so many family breakdowns, yet when that child seeks some support from governments we are told by politicians such as the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) in recent weeks on radios around Australia that the allowance is an incentive. Whoever is doing that is apologising for abusers, denying abuse is taking place and blaming the kids, who are the victims of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that this is not primarily a Commonwealth responsibility. In recent times the states have also shown that they understand that. So I am delighted to have received an invitation to address next month the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education and Youth Affairs. That makes it clear to me that the state ministers are interested in finding solutions&mdash;unlike the opposition. It means that state ministers are prepared to sit down with the Commonwealth and talk about the ways this report may be implemented in some form. Issues contained in the report may then become relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a long-term report about a long-term problem and will require a long-term response. Any idea that this somehow is an instant solution is nonsense. It was never proposed that way. I am confident that over the next two or three years, if the states cooperate, we as a country can make serious progress on the cause of these problems. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes. The Commonwealth intervened in an appeal by the Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union against the approval of the implementation of an enterprise flexibility agreement (EFA) at Tweed Valley Fruit Processors Pty Ltd on the grounds that the Commissioner at first instance failed to apply the "no disadvantage" test correctly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission quashed the approval of the EFA on 26 October. In doing so it agreed with the Commonwealth submissions that the Commissioner at first instance incorrectly applied the "no disadvantage" test. The Full Bench noted that the Commissioner erred in finding that the approval of the EFA would not result in a reduction in any entitlements or protections. In addition to paid sick leave, the Full Bench identified a large number of reductions in award entitlements. These included changes to bereavement and jury service leave, overtime rates, annual leave loading, meal breaks, hours of work, wages for junior employees, public holidays and redundancy pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to the Commonwealth was the provision in the agreement which allowed for the prospective cashing out of sick leave. The Full Bench decided, consistent with Commonwealth submissions that whilst it is possible under the "no disadvantage" test to trade off award entitlements as part of an overall package, the public interest element of the test was intended to protect well established and accepted community standards, such as sick leave.</PARA>
