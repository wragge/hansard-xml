<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the problems with being in continuation is that you forget what you have said previously. My problem is compounded by a very convivial dinner last night with my predecessor in the seat of Kalgoorlie. I want to dwell on the importance of industry policy to the future of this nation. Without industry policy there will not be full employment, without an import replacement manufacturing industry there will not be full employment and then the only future for Australia will be as a high wage country. Those people who talk about cutting wages are talking nonsense because we will never be able to cut wages enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big problem we have had in Australia, the great failure of the Menzies years of government and the result of the high tariff walls, is that there was no recognition of the need for Australian control. I stress that control is actually more important than ownership, although ownership usually implies control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the motor car industry. In 1946, Mr Hartnett, who was then the General Manager of General Motors Holden's and, I believe, a great Australian, suggested that we should have a car industry. He said to Mr Chifley, `If we are going to have a car industry we must have our own industry, we cannot make someone else's cars and we must have control.' Decisions are made either out of the hope of gain or the fear of loss. In my view, the government at that time acted out of fear of loss and decided it would invite General Motors into Australia to make a car here. That way it was seen that there could be no loss and there could be no failure. After all, the Americans knew how to make motor cars and perhaps we did not. Although we had been producing the most sophisticated aeroplane engines, the government lacked faith in our ability to produce cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we got was a second-rate American car which brought with it total American control. Had he we opted for an Australian car it would have been a more risky road, but there would have been more potential to develop. If we had produced an Australian car, it probably would have had a six-cylinder motor because of the large distances we have to travel. Because of our road conditions at the time, it would have had good suspension and higher ground clearance. Due to our climate and the distances we travel, it would have had a big radiator and a large petrol tank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, it would have been a car very suitable to the Australian conditions at the time and the conditions that prevailed in the Indian subcontinent, Africa and most of South America. We could have had the Volvo of the Southern Hemisphere. Instead we got a second-rate American car which we could sell only where the Americans wanted us to sell it. Due to connivance between the company and the unions, the tariff walls were forced up which made those cars more expensive. Those cars were built just for the Australian market. This was an opportunity lost. The car industry today is foreign owned and it would be very hard for Australia to get into that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to now look at niches. I do not think we are as disadvantaged in heavy transport. There is still a future, a potential, for us there. Certainly, we could look specifically at the area of four-wheel drives but it would have to be Australian owned, in my view, to be of any enduring value to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing we must look at&mdash;and both sides of this House talk about it&mdash;is the need for value adding. Anyone can see that there is great potential in value adding in terms of jobs. Unfortunately, our customers of our main products, which are raw materials, do not want us to value add. They want the raw material because they know that value adding is where the jobs are. Of course, you must give the customers what they want. We do not have any alternative because they will raise either border barriers or duties if we try to transform mineral products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the mineral industry, Australia's most important industry, we have to give this matter great consideration. We should value add the front end. Australia is the world's premier miner. There is no country in the world in terms of productivity that mines better than Australia, and in terms of the technology we apply we are state of the art. But we do not make the machinery, except on a very small basis. We import about $1.2 billion worth of equipment every year that we could manufacture ourselves&mdash;they are not my figures but those of the CSIRO&mdash;but we do not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do, however, get this equipment in the main designed for Northern Hemisphere conditions, probably for cold and wet conditions, and we modify them for hot, dry and dusty conditions&mdash;the conditions which prevail in the areas where mining nowadays tends to take place. We design modifications and make them work. They then go overseas and are fitted to the equipment. In other words, we pay for our own modifications, which is incredibly silly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now in a situation where Australian mining companies are getting access to the Pacific Rim, Asia and South America. In Mongolia I believe wages are something like $37 a week. With the mineral resources they have, and using Australian high technology and good management, they could outproduce us. We could be in a situation where our mining companies move offshore, particularly if they are subjected to increasing sovereign risk. We would then be left with nothing because we would have no manufacturing industry, and we would not have mining either. It is a grave concern which must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we manufactured equipment, however, we could sell it even if that equipment were more expensive because in the mining industry quality equates with price. If an item is more expensive but more reliable, it is actually cheaper for the mining companies and they will buy it, particularly the production mines. We are not in that position. Britain, on the other hand, although it is no longer a major coalminer, is a major supplier of coalmining long haul equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are missing that vital boat. We need to have a leapfrog in technology. We need to get our people working, get our design teams out there, coming up with innovative machinery. There are areas of the mining industry that will have to be addressed such as robotics, automatic underground steering of vehicles and remote controls for vehicles such as bulldozers and the like working in dangerous environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has the cutting edge in that area but we are not doing enough with it, and I believe that is the missing link. We have the large mining companies. We have the large customers. We have the state-of-the-art customers. We are the best miners in the world. We have the suitable R&amp;D, and we have demonstrated that. What is lacking is government will. That does not mean massive government subsidies at all; it means we need government commitment to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will point out how important this government will is. Jonathan Todhunter, who in my view is a great man, has contributed a lot to Australia. During the wool crisis, he was writing about the need for value adding our wool. It is through his efforts that the first, and in fact only, custom top maker was established in Parkes. That company has now become one of the world's best top makers in terms of quality and price. He has said to me on several occasions that he would not have persevered with that business as he did under extremely difficult personal conditions had it not been for the support he got from the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had talks with the minister who told him that he wanted the industry, that he believed in it. He said without that support from the minister he would not have pursued it. It is true that the company got a loan from the government of $10 million. That was small in comparison to the loan that went to a similar company in Geelong which has not been anywhere near as successful. But he said it was mainly that support from the minister that encouraged him to pursue it. It is very important for the government to have this philosophy and belief in the people of Australia so that we can have in this nation a very good manufacturing industry&mdash;a state-of-the-art, import replacement manufacturing industry. This does not necessarily imply tariffs, but I do not resile from the need for tariffs if you need to set the industries up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are smart about it, we should look at the way to go about it; we should look at the sorts of industries we want. This is not a case of picking winners, although I do not resile from that. Other countries pick winners; I do not know why we cannot. But it is picking the direction that you need to go in, the sorts the industries you want. There is a big future here for us in Australia. I believe that if we do not address this we are simply never going to get on top of employment and we are never going to be able to address the continuing current account problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be something about the air in the west that we have the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) coming in here and speaking largely good sense. Most of what he says in this place, at least what I have heard this morning, is a strident criticism of the government of which he is a member. His former colleague from the west Senator Walsh was also a renowned critic of the government while he was a member of the government, in fact a minister of the government. Eventually I think he threw his hands up in the air and said it was all beyond redemption and resigned as a minister and subsequently from the parliament. Since he has left the parliament he has remained a strident critic. Most of what I read of the former Senator Walsh makes a lot of sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, as the member for Kalgoorlie said, we should have had and can still have an effective manufacturing industry in this country. But what the Labor Party has never come to grips with and, it seems to me, is incapable of ever coming to grips with is the main ingredient of that&mdash;an industrial relations system that allows that to happen. We can talk about tariffs till the cows come home, and the member for Kalgoorlie was right to the extent that you cannot have the manufacturing industry behind a high protective wall of tariffs and expect it to be competitive because it will not be and it has not been. He pointed to the car industry as a prime example of something that had so much potential but will eventually be protected out of existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, you have to survive in the world market if you are going to be a part of the world market, and that is what we aspire to be. To be a part of that the real ingredient that you cannot overlook is the need for a competitive, modern industrial relations system. This government has not only failed to deliver that but also gone in the wrong direction, and we are seeing evidence of that in the newspapers every day. We have seen evidence even in the last week of criticism by a judge about the unfairness, the unreasonableness and the imbalance that exists in the current industrial relations legislation which clearly favours employees and militates against employers' interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will not work. It has not worked. It is anti-employment. Of course the word out in the electorate that I get everyday is: if you cannot fire them, then you are not going to hire them. That whole industrial relations system needs to be overhauled radically and changed to enable Australia to develop competitive manufacturing industries and to find our way in the world. Until we come to grips with that as a country, until that happens, then of course we will not survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind, nor in the minds of most Australians, that the government won the last election by a combination of deceit and default. The extent of that deceit has become more clear as time has gone by and more apparent with broken promise after broken promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget which was presented to this parliament in May was the latest in a long line of frauds perpetrated on Australians by this government. This was a pre-election budget. Everybody knew that, barring some unforeseen circumstances, this was going to be the last budget of the Keating government. Its main intention, therefore, as I understand it, was to buy a little time. The government realised that it needed to produce a budget which would be fiscally responsible, for obvious reasons, and, balanced with that, which would fulfil the requirements of any other pre-election budget. In other words, it was the budget on which the government was going to have to go to the people and seek re-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turns out, the government has failed on both counts. The worst thing for Labor, as the post-budget wash-up has shown, is that nobody bought the rhetoric, despite the very best efforts of that master salesman the now Dr Keating. His prescription has proved to be a pill which nobody was prepared to swallow, except for the government members who come into this place and attempt to defend the indefensible. We have heard them speak in this budget debate. Many of them must be very nervous indeed about their prospects of coming back to this place after the next election. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Connolly, apparently for other reasons, is not coming back. Let us recap on what Labor's legacy is at this stage to the people of Australia. We are talking here about 12 years of Labor government. A lot is said in this parliament about debt. I suspect that the average person out there in the electorate has yet to come to understand debt, because the economics of the debt that has been created are complex. But as time passes they will begin to understand more clearly not only the extent of the debt that the government has created for this country but, more importantly, the impact that this level of debt will ultimately have on every Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this government came to power, Australia's external net debt was around $23 billion, about $1,000 per capita when Mr Howard was last Treasurer&mdash;a debt level within reasonable bounds and obviously in aggregate terms not extremely high. But our net debt level today exceeds $170,000 million, which is over $11,000&mdash;that is, an 11-fold increase&mdash;for every man, woman and child in Australia. Some of that is public debt and some of it is private debt. In the end it does not really matter; it is a debt that Australia has one way or another. That debt will increase by another $27 billion this year. The irony of the budget that has been brought down is that, for all of the apparent pain that we have gone through with the recession we had to have and a budget that I will deal with in detail in a moment, there will be very little gain. We still end up with a forecast deficit in addition to our debt levels of $27 billion a year, which is about as high as it will have been for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total debt level is getting close to six per cent of our gross domestic product. That places us second in the world only to Mexico. That needs to sink in with people. We read in the paper about Mexico struggling for survival&mdash;virtually being bankrupt and having to go to the United States and, thanks to President Clinton's largesse, getting a huge injection of funds, billions and billions of dollars, just to allow it to survive. Yet Australia compares unfavourably with Mexico in our level of debt. We are now close to the highest debtor country in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians need to understand that this will severely impact on our standard of living in the future. You cannot keep propping up the country by borrowing money. The government in this budget has simply bought a little time. It is keeping its fingers crossed that some of its projections will come true so that somewhere down the track&mdash;and we are talking, as most of the budget talks, about years and years down the track&mdash;we will eventually perhaps be able to buy back some of the farm which we have sold off or repay some of the debt we have created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt to which I refer is one that none of us in this place will have to worry much about. But let me assure the House and the people of Australia that it will be a problem for our children and for our grandchildren. It will continue to place enormous pressure on our standard of living. The inevitable consequence of this debt, of course, is that our standards of living will fall and continue to fall. It is not a terribly difficult proposition to manage the country's budgets. In very simple terms, it is a bit like running your own household budget. When you get to the point in your household budget where you have to sell the family jewellery to pay for the weekly groceries, you are pretty desperate. That is where this government is in terms of running this country, and that is exactly what we see in this particular budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates are another legacy of this government's poor economic management over 12 years. We get told here that interest rates are coming down&mdash;and, of course, they are coming down from historically high levels. But the point is that in real terms we still have in this country both the highest long-term and short-term interest rates in the world. That does not really sink in with most people. They sort of look at the aggregate interest rates and think, well, they were 15 per cent, let us say, a couple of years ago; they are down to seven or eight per cent now; that is a pretty good improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is that, when we get to talk of real interest rates&mdash;and that is, after all, what the real cost of doing business in this country is, and it is a real cost, of course, that is borne by those industries which are attempting to compete in the world&mdash;it is real interest rates really that we are talking of, because they are the ones with which we are competing against the rest of the world. And, as I say, we still have close to the highest long-term and short-term interest rates in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is another legacy of this government. Of course, we have gone through a period where we had the highest level of unemployment in the history of this country, the worst recession since the Depression and unemployment levels that have exceeded one million. Even with this budget, there is still a projection of unemployment at the end of it all being in excess of eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that everybody in Australia who has any brains at all realises that even that figure vastly understates the real level of unemployment in this country. The way that unemployment is measured is actually extremely generous. I think the government has gone to great lengths wherever it can to minimise that figure. We all know that the government has cooked up all these schemes, programs and everything else; it basically does everything it can to get people out of that unemployment figure. But I believe that, when you really count the underemployed people in this country and count those who are counted as employed because they are doing a couple of hours of work a week, you would probably find that the real level of unemployment, including underemployment, in this country is twice the official number. I think that is deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly deplorable because many of those people who are unemployed are young people. It is no wonder that, as we meet young people in our constituencies, we are currently faced with what I think is a very sad situation where there are young people about to leave school, entering high school, perhaps with a prospect of leaving school within a few years time, who really have very little hope or optimism about their future in this country simply because they know that already those who are leaving school are unemployed in huge numbers. We are talking about 30 to 40 per cent of young people in some areas being and remaining unemployed and, in fact, with very little prospect of becoming employed. They, therefore, of course, are totally destroyed by that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen, of course, in Australia over the last 12 years a decline in our national savings level to record low levels&mdash;and, in fact, not only historically low levels for Australia but also internationally. The reasons for that are complex once again. The fact is that the government knows that is a problem and is attempting to do something about it&mdash;and, to some extent, it requires a long-term solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is that taxation levels, as they are in Australia, are high. Let us face it, the story the government trots out about Australia being a low tax nation is another furphy, another piece of rhetoric we hear the master salesman coming out with. I repeat: the fact is that we are very highly taxed in this country, by any comparison, if you get right to the bottom line&mdash;especially if you start comparing apples with apples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People cannot save in that sort of situation. The only way people can save is if you allow them to have more disposable income. Then they will choose to save, given the right incentives, which are not there either. A government that effectively says to people, `I can spend your money for you better than you can,' is counterproductive in terms of saving. If you want people to save, you have to give them the wherewithal to save. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could give the minister a bit of a lesson in economics. I think he is a lawyer and I excuse him for his economic illiteracy, but the fact is that if you want people to save, you have to reduce taxes. In Australia we have gone in the other direction. We have on the other side of this House the highest taxing, highest spending government virtually in the history of this nation. People cannot save in that environment. The result of 12 years of Labor is the lowest saving levels ever, the low savings levels by international comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other legacy of Labor&mdash;it is a very long list and I am obviously going to run out of time&mdash;is that our dollar is now very much undervalued. Yesterday there was a question to the Treasurer (Mr Willis)&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister can have a chance later, I am sure. I would very much like to stay here and listen if he does want to get up and justify the budget, because I think it would be a very interesting exercise. The Treasurer was asked a question yesterday about the fall of the Australian dollar vis-a-vis the yen. His answer to that was glib and oversimplified. He simply got up and said, `All currencies are falling against the yen. That is okay. We are just part of the bunch.' That was a totally inadequate answer. That is just dismissive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Australian dollar has fallen dramatically against the yen over the last five years. The yen, as the Treasurer rightly said, is one of the strongest currencies in the world. We ought to be concerned about the fact that our dollar has so devalued against the yen. My colleague the member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson) is an expert in this area, so I am aware of his presence. I am sure he will correct me privately if I am wrong, but it seems to me the Australian dollar to the yen has probably depreciated at least fivefold. Even 12 months ago, the dollar was worth about 100 yen. I think it is down to about 60 and still falling. </PARA>

The fact is that it is almost too expensive for Australians to go to Japan now. It is very cheap for Japanese to come here, and we value them. Certainly in my electorate we have lots of tourists from Japan and that is a very valuable by-product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian dollar has gone down relative to almost every other currency. I was in Korea recently. The Korean won is becoming a more and more valuable currency. The Australian dollar is consistently being devalued against the won, but you could use as an example just about any Asian currency or even the American dollar. That is one that most Australians are familiar with. Again, there has been a pattern of the Australian dollar coming down and down. That is a judgment of the world community on the Australian economy. It is a judgment on this government's management of the Australian economy. It is a very obvious measure of the world community's estimation of this government's economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer's answer to that question yesterday about the depreciation of the dollar was glib. He knows, if he is perfectly honest&mdash;anyone that is informed knows&mdash;that the fall of the Australian dollar has enormous economic ramifications for us. As it continues to fall, so it will continue to be a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me, in the couple of minutes I have remaining, just examine the government's insipid response to this crisis. What we have after 12 years of Labor government, as I have just outlined, is a crisis, by any standards. Mexico has a crisis and has had to go to America and borrow billions and billions of dollars. We are not too far behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget we have a fabricated surplus with asset sales and other fiddles incorporated there. There are even, as we have now found out, some serious errors in double counting with the sale and lease-back of Dasfleet and so on. So we have a fabricated surplus. There are tax increases, not the promised tax cuts. Personal taxation is going up 13.6 per cent; sales tax is up and expanded; cars are going up $1,000; homes are going up $1,000; the Medicare levy has gone up; company tax has gone up; and the fringe benefits tax has gone up&mdash;and we were promised tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How long can the government get away with this? We will see. We will not have long to wait before we find out. I suspect that, at the next election, the Australian people will make a very well thought-out response to the government's management of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see in the budget increased, not decreased, expenditure outlays which are up 7.1 per cent in 1995-96 after taking out asset sales. This is a big spending, big taxing government. It has proved itself incapable of running the Australian economy. This budget was no response to the crisis in which we now find ourselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to join in the debate this year on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), to have the opportunity to put on record my appreciation of some of the programs which are contained in the budget and to outline how some of them will actually affect my electorate. I would say to the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) that, rather than stand on his side of the House and tell this side of the House that he wants the Australian dollar to be worth 100 yen, he should perhaps go down to his National Party rump and tell them that he wants the dollar at 100 yen, or spend two minutes with the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and tell him that he wants the dollar at 100 yen&mdash;as he leaves the House without bothering to hear the remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget will bring quite worthwhile benefits to the Australian economy. It will continue the growth in the national economy which has seen benefits pass on particularly to the north coast of New South Wales. In the last 12 to 18 months there has been strong growth, particularly in the employment position, in that area. We have seen some 25,000 to 26,000 jobs created in just over 12 months along that coastal area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The north coast of New South Wales is generally seen as a retirement area where a lot of people from Victoria and Sydney go to retire after they have finished their working life. And why not? It has an ideal climate with many other benefits attached to living there. It means that the infrastructure of the area is strained considerably with the high immigration rate, if I could refer to it that way. Nevertheless, the employers on the north coast are to be congratulated for their efforts at finding niche markets and being able to take on that number of extra employees. In the last 12 to 15 months we have seen a good turnaround in the employment statistics, from 17.2 per cent down to the figure for this month of 11.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still much work to be done in that area. As I indicated, the infrastructure is barely keeping up with the population growth. That makes it very difficult for local government regions to be able to provide the many needed services and amenities which one would associate with the area and with the population that we do have on the north coast. Nevertheless, I feel that the federal government is doing its little bit. With a little bit of encouragement from me and perhaps the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), my colleague in the next-door seat, we will continue that increased Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major initiatives that has been continued is the emphasis on regional economic development and the funding which has come through from regional development particularly to the regional economic development organisations. The Northern Rivers Economic Development Organisation was one of the first organisations to be put in place and able to take up some of that funding which was on offer to enhance the employment position in our area of the north coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effort that has been made to create jobs through the new work opportunities has been commendable, with some 600-plus positions thus far. The other work that NOREDO is able to offer the north coast is to coordinate many of the different regional local groups so that they can work on a regional basis, put together plans and function to maximise, if you like, any benefits which will come from their particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other area of the Department of Employment, Education and Training I would like to mention is the Commonwealth funding of an innovative project at Kingscliff, which is in my electorate. At present we have a new high school, which was established some years ago, and last year we had the official opening of the Kingscliff campus of TAFE, which was substantially federally funded. That particular campus is not quite full, but it is certainly time to look for the next stage, and that is what the Commonwealth government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case the Commonwealth has come through and given a grant towards a joint facility between the high school and the TAFE college. That grant will go towards the construction of seven classrooms, an art room, a science lab and a student studies area. The construction of those share facilities is innovative and it will establish the link between the two facilities and enhance the opportunities for senior students. There are many cases now of students in year 11 and year 12 doing joint high school board courses in conjunction with TAFE. So that linkage between the academic side, if you like, and the practical side is to be enhanced by that $3.1 million project, which will be completed by October this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the employment, education and training budget I would like to point out is that the Southern Cross University, centrally located in Lismore, has a university centre in Murwillumbah. It was originally the Tweed Open Learning Access Centre and has now been renamed the Tweed University Centre, but it still functions essentially as an open learning access centre. The great benefit of that is that students do not have to travel to Lismore to have access to university education; they can simply visit that centre and through the modern means of communication&mdash;through computers down a phone line&mdash;access information and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must point out that it is not just students of the Southern Cross University that are able to access their parent campus through the open learning access centre. Students who have come into the area&mdash;in one or two instances they have come all the way from Perth, South Australia and Victoria&mdash;have been able to finish their courses using the facilities provided at the university centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facility was used by some 400 students last year, and I had the pleasure just a week ago of attending a dinner to celebrate with the 20 graduates who used the centre this year and who graduated from their respective courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the management committee of the open learning access centre and, obviously, George Hanna, who has been a tower of strength behind the university centre since it has been established. Very shortly I will be meeting with the vice-chancellor of the Southern Cross University, Professor Barry Conyngham for the purpose of pushing along the university to further enhance that facility in the Tweed. I think it is most appropriate that that is done. The numbers going through the centre already indicate that the facility is worthy of an upgrade and a little bit of capital injection. I am sure that that will be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The north coast area has traditionally had high unemployment. It is probably the first time in my memory that the area has had unemployment at less than three per cent above the national average. It is certainly a sea change. We are all pushing for unemployment to come down around Australia. Again, I pay tribute to the employers who have been able to take up the challenge and take on&mdash;either through their own initiatives or by utilising some of the initiatives of the Department of Employment, Education and Training&mdash;further employees and get them into real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that my area is a retirement area. Because of the proportion of elderly we have, obviously aspects of human services and health are keenly watched and sought after. I had the pleasure three weeks ago of opening the Tweed Valley respite cottage at Kingscliff. That cottage was funded through a partnership involving the federal government and the Tweed council. I pay tribute to the council for its involvement. It certainly helped to provide the land and some of the site works that were needed. The Commonwealth government built the cottage at a cost of $162,000 under the Commonwealth respite for carers program. This cottage will provide respite care to people who suffer from dementia as well as relieve their carers for a day or so&mdash;in some cases even overnight&mdash;in the Tweed region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think everyone understands the difficulty that carers have in looking after on a 24-hour basis someone who is frail or someone who might be suffering from dementia. The Kingscliff centre was most welcome. Appreciation was strongly expressed by the council and by the executive of the respite cottage on the day it was opened, and they continue to express their appreciation for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carers are certainly the cornerstone of our community care. For too long their efforts were not sufficiently recognised. This has been addressed through programs such as the Commonwealth respite for carers program and through projects like the Tweed Valley Respite Cottage. It will be offering quality respite care by trained staff. As I indicated, it will give carers of particularly people with dementia a chance to have a welcomed break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of respite care I am quite proud has been undertaken in the area is the Byron shire respite day care service. That works out of the Brunswick Valley community centre located at Brunswick Heads. Some honourable members may be familiar with that town. The Brunswick Valley community centre is a state, federal and local government initiative which has been up and running for some two years. It caters for various community groups&mdash;amongst them in this case is the respite day care service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This service operates three days a week. It provides centre based day care for elderly people and again gives carers an opportunity to relax, possibly go off to do their shopping or just spend some time at home for themselves apart from attending to other matters that they would certainly be unable to do without a great deal of difficulty without a respite centre in close proximity. I mentioned that the funding for that project comes from the federal government. A little also comes through the state government as it is a project through the home and community care program, or HACC, which is Commonwealth and state funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The door-to-door transport for the people concerned is also provided by a community facility&mdash;the Ballina-Byron Community Transport Group, which is ably chaired by Mick Malloy, who has been in that position for quite some time and is certainly well known for his efforts in coordinating that&mdash;as well as the volunteer drivers who are involved. They do a tremendous job of transporting people to not just the Byron Shire Respite Day Care Service but to various other areas, shopping centres and so forth right across the Ballina and Byron shires. My best wishes go to Collin Munroe, the coordinator of that centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it is an area where there is a high proportion of retirees, as I have indicated, it leads to some difficulties in the proportion of aged people immigrating. This means that sometimes the capital grants for facilities are lagging behind what is actually required. Most of the grants are allocated on a census basis or on further surveys and updates. With a population growth of somewhere between four per cent and six per cent in different areas&mdash;overall across the north coast it is probably four per cent, but in other areas it is much higher than that&mdash;this is where we run a little behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal governmental allocated another 40 nursing home beds to the Byron and Ballina areas late last year. I am certainly keen to see the minister allocate at least that number again when the next allocations are made. The facilities of the Maranoa nursing hostel at Alstonville were one of the earlier community organisations which provided aged care. The facilities are certainly marvellous when you consider that they were built almost 20 years ago and you look at the nature of the design. Obviously, the facilities do not meet today's standards, but if we look at the facilities today we know that the people who established those facilities had a great deal of foresight. A capital upgrade package is required for that facility. I will certainly be supporting them in any representations that are made to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be doing the same with the St Andrews nursing home in Ballina&mdash;another facility which was established some years ago with great foresight. The aged care complex there received quite a needy grant sum two years ago to provide facilities for the dementia patients. I might take the time to point out that what I think needs to be done in aged care&mdash;we have various ratios for those over 70&mdash;and the number of nursing home and hostel beds that are required in an area where the number per thousand head of population over 70 is for the formula to be stiffened, taking into consideration that of those now going into a nursing home as many as a quarter or a third suffer from some form of dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a simple fact. Anyone who has been in nursing homes would appreciate what I am saying. The federal government's formula in funding has to take into consideration the higher costs for that aspect of ageing and the impost it puts on people running nursing homes. They are two areas that I will certainly be supporting in any future funding round from Health, Housing and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving to the other end of the age bracket&mdash;child care&mdash;what has come out of this particular budget has been extremely beneficial to areas such as mine. My electorate is a little further than most from capital and provincial cities and is an area that has, over the years, been out of favour in the rounds of funding. But greater access to child care, certainly through the child-care services, is now coming through. Right across my electorate, the family day care centres in the Tweed Coast area and Murwillumbah have certainly enabled many women particularly&mdash;I know in one or two cases it is not just women&mdash;to get back into the work force, as has the Ballina-Byron family day care centre, which covers both of those two areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other innovative project which has just started up is the outside school hours care service at Tweed Coast&mdash;which is actually located at Kingscliff Primary School but covers what is called the Tweed Coast villages from Pottsville, Cabarita, Hastings Point and Kingscliff. The outside school hours service commenced operations at the beginning of this year with federal funding for 30 child-care after school hours places and 30 vocation care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That centre has been established by a voluntary parent committee, which worked for some 12 months before the service actually commenced, to ensure that the vital service was available to parents in that Tweed Coast region in my electorate. I have already mentioned the Ballina-Byron region which received 30 extra places&mdash;they were already established&mdash;and they were able to put in 15 extra places in Alstonville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government is doing a great deal for the elderly and for families in the electorate of Richmond. Much appreciation has been expressed in very strong terms to me, and I am simply passing on to the federal government and the appropriate ministers how people feel about that vital area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other area that I am most pleased about is the recent launch by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) of the coastal care policy. It will be of great benefit. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I can assure you that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Injured coastline</EMPHASIS> report has been well received. I took part in the production of that report. All members of that committee are delighted&mdash;I am certainly delighted&mdash;that the government has responded in the way it has with the coast care package that gives some $23 million under the coastal care policy and the action plan. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year's budget indicates that the Keating government cannot be trusted in terms of its promises or its commitments to deliver programs. The Keating-Willis combination cannot be trusted to bring to fruition their commitments or promises made to the Australian people. The community cannot expect the government to bring to fruition legislation implementing tax cuts and other benefits arising from this budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to refer the House to some of the comments made by the Australian Labor Party during the last election campaign. I wonder whether members remember the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying in 1983 at Bankstown:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will open Medicare up to the private hospital system, so that it can purchase an estimated 10,000 private hospital beds per year for people on waiting lists.</PARA>
<PARA>Do we remember Graham Richardson, the former senator, in May of the same year breaking that promise? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not certain if we're going to spend all of it on that yet. I mean, that's something that's got to be investigated fairly carefully and obviously it depends upon how much private hospitals are prepared to go along with the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>Do we remember the letter from John Della Bosca to small businesses during the election campaign? As a postscript to his letter appealing for funds for the Australian Labor Party he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been proven around the world that small business, especially industries like yours, will be the big losers from Dr Hewson's Fightback experiment. Dr Hewson will increase tax on you, turn you into a tax collector (unpaid) and give big companies a more competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How will your clients react when your bills have 15% added to them?</PARA>
<PARA>Ask the home buyers of Australia and those currently building homes under a firm contract how they feel now that the Australian Labor Party, despite the promise in that letter that it would not do so, has increased their costs by 12 per cent on the hardware items in the house&mdash;an increase in the cost of an average home of between $1,000 and $2,000. Ask the Australian home buyers, the people who are putting on extensions and those who were expecting better care under the health schemes, how they feel about the broken promises of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in writing from John Della Bosca, campaign director for the Australian Labor Party, that the home buyers and the small businesses of Australia would suffer under a national goods and services tax, but here we have a goods and services tax from the Australian Labor Party on all sorts of commodities in order to raise funds and for a phoney balancing of the current budget. How can the Australian Labor Party be trusted? How can one ever expect anything it says to be delivered? To believe the Australian Labor Party would be like taking a berth on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS>, knowing that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> was going to sink. It would be like buying a ticket on the flight that crashed over Lockerbie, knowing that the plane was going to be involved in that disaster. Why would anybody trust anything that the Australian Labor Party said?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the budget I picked up a copy of the autumn 1995 edition of the ACTU publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workplace</EMPHASIS>. Prior to the budget the ACTU research officer, Grant Belchamber, wrote about what the workers of Australia might expect to see in the budget. They have been let down. Even though they had a prior understanding and a prior commitment from the government of Australia as to what the government would try to do for the workers, the battlers have missed out. Mr Belchamber was under the false impression that the May budget was going to create jobs in Australia. The May budget will not create jobs. There is not enough growth in the economy for jobs to be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that every day the Prime Minister crows about the Australian economy slowing down. What a thing to be proud of! `The worse we are, the slower the economy goes, the better the Australian people should like it.' That is what we hear from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) every day. The more the economy slows, the fewer jobs there are, the less activity there is, the more they are succeeding in their goals and objectives. I will quote what Mr Belchamber, the research officer for the ACTU, said prior to the budget:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the May budget does cement in place a program to sustain job growth through to the next century and we do get the falling unemployment rate the country needs, there is an excellent chance that we will also restore the nation's level of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>What a let-down for him and for the workers of Australia. The ACTU's Martin Ferguson is in the House today. He must be a very disappointed man, despite the glossy remarks he made after the budget. He must be very disappointed in the Australian Labor Party. He was consulted all the way through. The workers of Australia are supposed to participate in the way in which this government operates. Mr Belchamber, in the ACTU's own journal, was saying that employment was the key to the government's success in the budget. How they have been let down! There are extra taxes. There is no growth. There are broken promises, with a harsher time ahead for families who will have $25 or $26 a week extra imposts because of this budget. That is for the average family. What a disappointment!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can one trust the Australian Labor Party? It is like buying a ticket on the Lockerbie aircraft, knowing that it is going to explode. Why would you buy that ticket? Why would you trust the Australian Labor Party? Look at its record. Nobody would trust it. Mr Belchamber, the research officer of the ACTU, concludes that article by predicting what the budget should do. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But consolidating the White Paper initiatives, ensuring they are adequately resourced&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>listen to that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and integrated with the special needs and opportunities of regional Australia, will be the bottom-line test of adequacy for the coming federal budget.</PARA>
<PARA>The government cut employment programs, I have to tell the House, by $1 billion. Again Mr Belchamber was sadly disappointed. He was another of those potential passengers on the Lockerbie aircraft which ended in disaster. He bought his ticket. He trusted the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to note some of the language that the Prime Minister used during this period. Referring to a member of the opposition, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is part of that sleazy party that had no principle ever on anything.</PARA>
<PARA>That could apply to the Prime Minister. He has no policy and has no principle on anything. One way of testing a person's attitude is to see how that person treats others. The Prime Minister's attitude to others gives a pretty good understanding of his character and outlook. In a reference to another member of the opposition, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is brain damaged, Mr Speaker, have pity on him.</PARA>
<PARA>One would have to wonder whether the Prime Minister was referring to himself and his Treasurer. He used those words in the parliament about a member of the parliament. It is time the Australian people started to turn the Prime Minister's words back on him. They also need to try to understand why a man who so consistently breaks his promises expects to be re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the pre-budget papers of the ACTU and what it expected the Australian government would do in this budget. I have also referred to how the Australian government let the ACTU&mdash;its constituency, its fund raiser and its provider of resources which it used to win the last election&mdash;down. I pointed out that the expectation was that the May budget would cement in place job growth programs and would be a consolidation of the white paper initiatives in relation to employment. The government has built the budget in a way that its objective of no growth will not produce any new jobs or cut unemployment. Some $1 billion has been knocked out of its initiatives under the white paper. I do not understand what the Australian government is doing to its own constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to what John Della Bosca, the campaign manager for the Australian Labor Party at the last election, said the opposition might do to small business if it were elected to office. John Della Bosca said that an increase in taxes on small business would damage their prospects, but then within two years there has been a massive increase in taxes on business which was instigated by the party that by implication said it would not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is amazing. Why would anybody trust the Australian Labor Party? Why would anybody trust the Prime Minister? I certainly believe that the electors of Mitchell will not trust the Prime Minister because on my calculations the increase in income tax to be collected from the electorate of Mitchell, as a result of this year's budget, will be $57.9 million. That is extra tax that the government is going to take from the taxpayers of Mitchell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the electorate of Mitchell there are 70,000 people; not all of them are taxpayers. The government is going to rip from a comparatively small number of people in a comparatively isolated part of Australia another $58 million. From that pocket of Australia the government is going to get another $60 million. </PARA>

It is not going to benefit who you say you stand for&mdash;the ACTU&mdash;because it is not going to continue the initiative of job growth or the jobs program. It is not going to help the home buyers and home builders because you are going to put additional taxes on them and that is apart from the personal income tax increases that I have mentioned. Where is the benefit to Australia? There is no benefit to the average citizen of Australia. While the government is lauding itself for being responsible it is creating further problems for our fellow Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will point out some of the sophistry of the Australian Labor Party. Over the last few years it has claimed that it is going to sell assets. In four budgets it has said that it was going to sell Qantas. This time it is actually going to sell Qantas. The government counts the returns from the potential sale of Qantas in the budget to make it look good and then at the end of the year when it fails to sell or realise the price we get a bigger deficit than we planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said, `We will sell Qantas this year&mdash;sorry, we did not do it and we have a bigger deficit than we planned.' That has been going on for four budgets. It makes the balanced budget outcome look achievable for publicity purposes. It has not been achieved. In fact, when Australia runs at a loss it means that as taxpayers we are paying a heck of a lot of interest. This year Australian taxpayers are going to have to find nearly $10 billion to pay the interest on money the government has borrowed. Next year, it is going to be $9.4 billion. The year after, it is going to be $8.9 billion. Year after year, we are paying this sum just to keep the ego of the Prime Minister running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has made promises and not kept them. I will use the Lockerbie disaster as an illustration. He is just like the man at the ticket counter, or the fellow on television, saying, `We have a special package. See the world. Fly over Scotland. What a wonderful trip. You will arrive safely in the United States and it is a direct flight,' knowing all the time that a bomb will blow that plane to smithereens when it is over Scotland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the style of government the Australian Labor Party operates. It knows the results of its promises when it makes them. The Prime Minister, I will remind the House, made a commitment that we would have tax cuts. He said to the Australian people, `You can have all that the Liberal Party has promised and tax cuts as well. We promise you this and we will make it l-a-w, law.' He did make it l-a-w, law, except he cancelled the law last week and said, `We're not going to have it. I've changed my mind. But, in two years time, we'll get into a superannuation scheme. If you are 18 years of age today, in about 47 years time you will benefit from my scheme.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another promise like the trip over Lockerbie: `Believe my promise on superannuation and Australians will start saving again.' That is bunkum. It is a lie, and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer knew it was a lie on budget night and they hoped to convince the Australian people to believe the sophistry and the deceit of the Australian Labor Party in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people have woken up. It has taken them a while, and it has taken us a while to get the language to point out to the Australian people what a disaster the Labor Party has been. One only has to look further into the budget to find out that Australia is really running very well and very successfully as a slowing down economy. Every day, the Prime Minister and Treasurer come in here and say, `Things have slowed down even more. We are doing well.' All they are worried about is preserving their political skins because they are looking at the sensitive issue of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They know that interest rates are on the verge of rising. The timing of the next election depends on whether interest rates rise, remain stable or fall. The Prime Minister is hoping that he can manipulate and engineer a slight fall in interest rates. Even if it is just for a period of six weeks, it will be long enough for him to run to the Australian people and say, `There you are. We've done it again. Australia's on the mend.' But the Australian people this time will know that, at the end of the day, the ticket salesman for the Lockerbie aircraft knows that he has told another falsehood because he knows a bomb is on the aircraft. The Australian people are not going to wear the promise of falling interest rates and an economy under control, because they know there will be interest rate rises later in this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at our debt. If you look at the current account deficit for the last nine out of 10 months, this country has lost over $2 billion each month in that process. Where are the government's measures to take any control of that? It does not even have a plan. The government just staggers from day to day. The Prime Minister talks about policies to bring all of these things together. He goes up the coast, does something on the beaches&mdash;I think he calls it salting the mine&mdash;then swans around Parliament House doing something for the arts and whips that away at the next budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of things are happening all the time and the impression is that there is a lot of activity. Actually there are a lot of announcements, a lot of headlines, but there is no substance to what the Australian Labor Party is doing. The fact of the matter is that it does not care for the Australian people or the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last election campaign, one of the government's advertisements was headed `Leave our homes alone: no 15% GST'. The picture is of a married couple with a daughter and baby son outside a partly built home saying:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to endorse the 1995-96 budget, particularly its medium-term strategy to lift national savings by bringing the federal accounts into structural surplus and introducing mandated superannuation reforms. This government has always been prepared to tackle Australia's chronic economic problems. In 1995 this means addressing the relationship between national savings, the current account and the rate of unemployment. A clear pattern has emerged in Australia's economic cycle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever the current account deficit has approached six per cent of GDP, as it did in 1982, 1986 and 1990, growth has had to be slowed from the top of the business cycle for fear of an adverse response on currency markets. This has led to what I would term an externally constrained unemployment rate, ECUR, in Australia currently between six and eight per cent. The ECUR reflects, on the demand side of the labour market, a minimum level of unemployment linked to Australia's competitiveness and success on the external account. On the supply side, it is generally considered that Australia's non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, NAIRU, stands between 6.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent. Both measures, the ECUR and the NAIRU, indicate a standard of product and factor market efficiency requiring continuous reform to secure full employment. Continuous reform, of course, has been the hallmark of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the opening of the Australian economy to international influences in the mid-1980s, the policy instruments of competitiveness have been canvassed extensively in the public debate. In most respects, the technical requirements for successful micro-economic reform in Australia are now well established. The implementation of these policies, particularly in the states, is primarily a function of political conditions and commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has undertaken and entrenched in 10 years more micro reform and structural gains in the Australian economy than in the previous 80 years, the previous eight decades since Federation. In an internationalised trading environment, however, competitiveness is never static; it is always relative to the performance of our trading partners and competitors. Continuous gains and continuous reforms are all important. Improved competitiveness is central to resolving growth constraints on the external account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission, for instance, has estimated that full implementation of the Hilmer reforms would lower Australia's current account deficit by two per cent of GDP. This results from a 15.4 per cent increase in export volumes with only a 1.2 per cent increase in imports, reflecting high import substitution effects. Out of this substantial improvement in Australia's international competitiveness, pioneered by this government, the economy would be able to enjoy much longer and stronger growth runs in each business cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's trading performance also needs to be complemented by an activist strategy for national savings. When a small open economy with relatively low savings grows faster than its trading partners, there is inevitably an adverse impact on the current account and foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inadequate national savings are the source of the key pressure points in Australia's political economy, that is, corporate asset sales, inflationary expectations and the ECUR. As a nation we must overcome the persistent imbalance between savings and investment. Australia's underlying current account deficit has been estimated at 4.5 per cent of GDP. Net service payments on foreign liabilities have risen to four per cent of national output. Our exposure to these liabilities and growing foreign debt cannot be reduced without bringing the current account deficit below three per cent. The current account deficit mirrors the capital account on the balance of payments, that is, the extent to which Australia calls on the savings of overseas nations to cover the gap between our own level of investment and savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriate fiscal discipline is to run the federal budget at a structural surplus, that is, discounting the impact of one-off factors such as asset sales and swings in the business cycle. Less consumption spending by either the public or the private sector for a given level of income always means more savings&mdash;it always means more national savings, a lesson the opposition should appreciate in the run-up to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of the fiscal strategy is also all-important. Care needs to be taken with proposals for tax increases, spending cuts, compulsory levies and special tax breaks, which simply provoke a compensatory transfer between public and private forms of saving. Given the scale of the savings task in Australia, the structure and system of incentives for private savings should not be left unaltered. As a nation, Australia has not been known for a culture of long-term planning and personal thrift. For many decades the lucky country ethos promoted attitudes to wealth creation heavily reliant on commodity and property development, including a high premium on home ownership, known as the great Australian dream. Elements of a hedonistic lifestyle promoted the virtues of spending now and worrying later, best reflected in our approach, known in the national language as the `she'll be right' approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These cultural features, which remain strong in Australia, enhance the importance of a prescriptive approach to private savings such as compulsory and self-provident measures. The superannuation reforms announced in the 1995-96 budget represent a sea change in the nation's long-term savings capacity. I believe that 15 or 20 years from now, and perhaps I will still be here, parliamentarians on both sides of the House will be making speeches about the landmark reform of superannuation and national savings introduced in this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth while in this budget debate to compare the savings strategy proposed by the opposition to that of the government. In truth, the opposition is advocating in its policy parameters a strategy of dissaving, not adding to the national savings pool but taking away from it. It is playing the two-card trick of Australian politics&mdash;only showing one card at a time, however. The one card it shows on national savings is to express a policy, a desire, general parameters, to increase national savings, which as a proportion of GDP can only be achieved by lowering the share of national consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the shadow Treasurer, was at it again in his budget reply speech at the National Press Club on 17 May. He endorsed FitzGerald's goal of a five per cent of GDP increase in national savings. He said that was the objective the coalition in government would pursue. It needs to be appreciated by the House&mdash;perhaps it was not appreciated by the member for Higgins&mdash;that a five per cent of GDP improvement in national savings is the dollar equivalent of a $22.5 billion shift from national consumption to national savings. That is the policy, that is the goal, that has been endorsed by the shadow Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second card he plays in his two-card trick on the Australian public is to try to present inoffensive policies, never showing the two cards together. So one card says that the coalition wants a $22.5 billion dollar shift from national consumption to national savings. The other card tries to present inoffensive policies and increase consumption and lower national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has already declared that on these budget measures the coalition will oppose in the Senate the increases in company tax, the increase in the Medicare levy, the sales tax on cars, plus the PAYE remittance arrangements and the application of sales tax to some building materials. That is, the coalition in the Senate&mdash;because of its obstruction and the policies it has declared&mdash;will be endorsing measures which could increase consumption and lower national savings by $1.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of the coalition's policy framework to increase consumption and lower national savings, of course, comes from the new policy commitments the opposition has presented in this term of parliament. The shadow minister for social security has endorsed the introduction of a universal pension at a cost of $3 billion. The coalition has also endorsed tax concessions for private health insurance at a cost of $1 billion. It has also endorsed the removal of the tax from interest earnings on bank savings at a fiscal cost of $3 billion. The Leader of the Opposition, with his lifelong commitment to income splitting under the banner of tax relief for families, has re-endorsed that commitment at a budgetary cost of $3 billion. Finally, the shadow Treasurer has consistently outlined a commitment for tax relief on the FBT and the capital gains tax at a cost of $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aggregated cost of those new commitments in this term of parliament comes to $11 billion. The coalition on one hand, with one card, is saying that it wants to increase national savings and lower national consumption by $22.5 billion but is actually moving, according to these policies, $12.4 billion in the wrong direction; it is moving $12.4 billion in exactly the wrong direction to that which a savings strategy would dictate&mdash;the $12.4 billion being made up by the $1.4 billion obstruction in the Senate and the $11 billion in new promises. This adds up, quite remarkably, to a $35 billion hole, an inconsistency, in the savings and budgetary strategy of the opposition outlined thus far in this term of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets worse. When it comes to national savings accumulated by superannuation, the coalition is again moving in the wrong direction trying to run down national savings and increase consumption. The member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), in one of his last speeches as a member of parliament, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 26 May, actually outlined a policy for the opposition whereby superannuation savings could be used for buying a house or paying for children's education. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech to the Life Insurance Federation of Australia yesterday, the Opposition Spokesman on retirement incomes policy, Mr David Connolly, gave a strong indication that the Opposition would continue its plan as a central part of its superannuation strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The need to redefine superannuation in the context of the proposed 3 per cent compulsory superannuation is particularly relevant to young contributors," Mr Connolly said.</PARA>
<PARA>He further indicated that the coalition would allow superannuation savings to be used for consumption purposes such as buying a house or paying for education. Again, that is a direct contradiction, a direct inconsistency with the commitment that the coalition has given to increase national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not bad enough in terms of inconsistency, in terms of running down this government's medium-term savings strategy, as we heard in question time yesterday from the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Leader of the Opposition has announced a policy to freeze the superannuation guarantee at existing levels. The Leader of the Opposition announced this policy in his budget reply speech in our last parliamentary sitting week. As the Treasurer outlined yesterday, the estimated effect on total savings would be very significant. As a result of the coalition's policy to freeze the level of the superannuation guarantee, by the year 2000 about $17 billion of national savings, measured in today's dollars, would be lost; by the year 2003, that would be about $45 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a gaping hole, a gaping contradiction in the sorts of policies that the coalition is presenting. It is trying to play the two-card trick, trying to play the Australian people with the two-card trickery of Australian politics. In truth, the advantage that the government now has&mdash;and I hope it is also taken up by the press gallery&mdash;is to expose the inconsistency. One thing that the budget has done is to clear the decks on the policy debate. The Australian people know where this government stands in terms of its medium-term savings strategy; and we can now dissect and work out through these fiscal equations where the opposition stands on its policy parameters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, the only policy it has presented that could have a marginal impact on national savings is the discredited practice of lowering the tax on bank savings at a fiscal cost of $3 billion with perhaps&mdash;it is only a perhaps&mdash;a marginal gain on private savings. I am willing to assume, being quite good hearted, for the purposes of this exercise that the increase in private bank savings from the coalition's proposed tax change is cancelled out by the member for Bradfield's proposed superannuation reforms and the measures announced by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply speech. These policies would increase national consumption and I am willing to calculate, for the purposes of this exercise, that they cancel out any positive impact from increased private savings as a result of tax reform on bank savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This still leaves a $35 billion gap between the savings goal outlined by the shadow Treasurer at the Press Club, a five per cent GDP increase in national savings, and their declared policies, as I have just outlined them to the House. This is the same opposition that wants to lecture the government about the current account deficit, the same opposition that wants to lecture the government about foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response is to expose the inconsistency and to expose the large gap, the $35 billion gap, in the opposition's policies&mdash;the difference between the savings goal and the expenditure commitments it has made thus far. It is interesting to examine the means by which the opposition could fill this gap. The shadow Treasurer was at it on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 7 May. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not proposing any broadening of the tax base and we will not be proposing new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>He ruled out tax reform as a method for increasing public saving and decreasing private consumption. That leaves him only fiscal policy on the outlays side of the budget. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You're talking about two aspects, of course Laurie. One is, getting value for money, taxpayers' value for money which we've been consistently arguing for over a long period of time. The second is, as we've always said in relation to asset sales, that asset sales ought to take place where they deliver increased and better commercial benefits to consumers. Now we don't rule that out. That has never been a problem for the coalition. . . It is another string to the bow which we have available to us.</PARA>
<PARA>Just 10 days later, he was telling the Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Asset sales do nothing to boost national savings. They are simply a transfer of ownership from the public to the private sector and, of course, a transfer of savings from the private sector to the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the policy instruments the shadow Treasurer would use to fill the $35 billion gap, he has nothing to offer national savings through asset sales. Anyone on the coalition benches who thinks the privatisation of Telecom, which would perhaps realise $15 billion to $20 billion, once off, in a federal budget, adds to national savings, is wrong. People should appreciate that and understand that it has already been acknowledged as such by the shadow Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we apply a process of deduction, it brings the coalition to the point of filling the $35 billion gap in one of two ways. The first is to cut outlays. Thirty-five billion dollars represents 28 per cent of federal outlays. It is twice the amount of Commonwealth outlays on health, more than three times the amount of Commonwealth outlays on education and more than three times the Australian defence budget. These are remarkable figures. There is no way in the world the coalition could cut $35 billion from the Commonwealth budget without eating into health, education or defence spending&mdash;in fact, wiping them out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition members might greet these calculations with a little mirth. They should, because they demonstrate the full extent of the inconsistency and how absurd it is, with the outlays commitments on one hand, to promise any increase in national savings which would address the current account deficit or the foreign debt problem in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second mechanism which could be used by the coalition, and this is perhaps the most interesting, is to introduce a new, large, broad based tax such as the GST. It is no wonder that, when the Leader of the Opposition lies awake at night doing his sums, trying to increase national savings and what he would do on the federal budget&mdash;it is no wonder when he has those thoughts before he slumbers away for the evening&mdash;he comes forward with statements such as that reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 2 May:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the federal Opposition, Mr Howard, has left open the possibility of the Coalition reconsidering a goods and services tax "some time in the future"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"As to what happens some years in the future, I don't want to . . . I don't know," Mr Howard said.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sign of a confused leader trying to reconcile in his own mind the gaping inconsistency in the policy parameters being promoted by the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the budget has confirmed the choices available to the Australian people for the next election. The government, with quality policies, is not afraid to put them forward. The opposition is running away from the sort of detail needed to fill its $35 billion fiscal gap. The government, of course, has an outstanding savings strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget features all the elements of this government's approach to continuous economic reform. Its superannuation reforms and national savings strategy are among the most important policy developments in Australia's recent economic history. The budget and each of its provisions deserve the strong support of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 May this year the government brought down what has become known as the fudge-it budget and, in doing so, destroyed any remaining credibility that it had with the Australian electorate. The smoke and mirrors were billowing and flashing overtime as the government broke virtually every major economic promise of consequence. It fudged and distorted figures to a degree not seen before. It told a whole stack of untruths to the Australian electorate. It destroyed the reputation of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) for honesty, which I thought was sad. It saddled the Australian taxpayers with a stack of tax increases; the like of which we have hardly seen since the days of Whitlam and Cairns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the public is awake to this. The government has already slumped in the polls. The ratings of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have fallen even more. In short the government, and especially its arrogant Prime Minister, has long surpassed its use-by date. The sooner it goes the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to start by looking at some of the tax increases. Company tax, despite a faithful promise by the Prime Minister before the election that there would be no tax increases, has gone up from 33c to 36c in the dollar. Before the last election, the government had reduced company tax. This was a centrepiece of its business policy of which it made great play. Now the election is over, whack, up goes the tax again in a very cynical move. In doing so, it has plucked $3,970 million out of the business community, including the small business community, over the next four years. This is at a time when they desperately need that money to re-invest in their businesses and create employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy too, despite there being a faithful promise from the Prime Minister that there would be no tax increases, has gone up from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent. That will collect an extra $1,010 million over the next four years. This will probably mean that more people will drop out of private health insurance; a problem which this government is doing nothing to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On sales tax, the government now not only has sales tax indexed up every six months in this country but also has introduced a 12 per cent sales tax on certain building materials that did not attract it before. This is virtually its GST on the building industry. That sales tax will pull in $1,015 million over the next four years. This tax will be applied to screws, nails, paint, putty, adhesives, wallpaper, tiles, taps, nozzles, handles, and joinery such as prefabricated kitchen cupboards and office partitioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, with the abolition of the diesel fuel rebate scheme for miners who mine clay for bricks or sand for concrete, even bricks and mortar will be taxed. This will add in excess of $1,000 to the cost of an average house. The other day I walked into a hardware shop that sells a lot of paint. I worked out that, on the wholesale price alone, it would cost in excess of $1,000 to paint a house. So $120 is added to the cost of a paint job on a house, and this will have a significant effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the bobby-dazzler of all the tax increases is the tax on cars. It is a bit like the company tax increase. Before the election, the government reduced the sales tax on cars from 20 per cent to 15 per cent to match the tax we were going to put on cars. The Prime Minister made great play of that, and I will come to that in a minute. The 15 per cent has since gone to 16 per cent and, as a result of this budget, the 16 per cent is going to go to 21 per cent. That will add about $1,000 to the price of the average Commodore or Falcon. From 1 July this year, it will again go up by about $190 as the sales tax increases from 21 per cent to 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various estimates floating around, but that could mean a decrease in the sales of new cars in Australia in the coming year&mdash;a loss of about 30,000 sales. Over the next four years this tax will pluck $1,470 million out of the car industry which will go into Treasury coffers. I turn at this stage on a matter of credibility to the Prime Minister's first speech which he made on that fateful day&mdash;19 December 1991&mdash;when he became Prime Minister. I went and listened to what he had to say to the press assembled there that day. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Could I, in my first words as Prime Minister elect, Leader of the Labor Party elect, to you, the Australian people, say that I want to make three commitments to them. The first is I pledge to give everything I've got to the job and the country.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third commitment is I pledge to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all of the energy I can muster.</PARA>
<PARA>But I want to dwell on the second commitment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second is to deal honestly with the people, to tell them the truth. In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting the temptation as much as is humanly possible. I'll speak honestly with them, to them, and realistically, and I'll listen accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the commitment the Prime Minister made at his press conference just after he stabbed Bob Hawke in the back. About a minute later in that statement to the press in December 1991, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the holiday period&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to Christmas&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will spend time talking to my colleagues and working on proposals I want to put before the Cabinet in the early new year. I would like to start 1992 with a cohesive and comprehensive plan to push Australia ahead. I've got a good idea already of what should be in that plan, what should be done, but I want to tie it all together and make sure that we have it right.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in December. In February the Prime Minister delivered the One Nation statement&mdash;his first statement of consequence to the parliament. On 26 February 1992 his opening sentence was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, when I became Prime Minister a little over two months ago I pledged to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy I could muster.</PARA>
<PARA>He has rehashed two out of the three promises. It is interesting to note which promise he dropped&mdash;being honest with the Australian people, telling the truth and not gilding the lily. On the second page of the One Nation statement he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's plan for the next four years will create over 800 000 jobs, without increasing the current account deficit&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Labor Party has certainly breached that promise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and at the same time return the budget to surplus.</PARA>
<PARA>I will return to that promise later. The Prime Minister made various other promises such as the one about binding Australia and New Zealand together in aviation `in a truly competitive environment'. But the promise that particularly interests me is on page 10 of this report. Under the heading `MOTOR VEHICLES', the Prime Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the recession has had a severe effect on motor vehicle sales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be permanently lowered to 15 per cent&mdash;a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries.</PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. The Prime Minister said he would tell Australians the truth and nothing but the truth, he would not gild the lily and he would permanently drop sales tax on motor vehicles from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. But what did he do after the election? Whack! The tax went back up again to 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably, if we accept the Prime Minister's logic in the One Nation statement, this will mean dearer cars and we will be driving older cars, which is bad for the environment, bad for road safety and bad for one of our most important industries. After that, we can only say: what is the Prime Minister's word worth? The conclusion, I suggest, is fairly obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said this is also a fudge-it budget. I say that because the government has said it will bring in a surplus of $718 million even though it has increased spending in this budget. Spending has not been cut. If we look at the various last pages of Budget Paper No. 1, a very thick document, we see the underlying rate of deficit is $8.232 billion. The government has been able to say it will deliver a surplus only if it brings in a lot of assets sales. It has promised to sell $5.3 billion worth of assets in the first year. </PARA>

That is in five years, and the government is asking us to believe that it will sell $5.3 billion in one year. We will wait and see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is selling Qantas for the fourth time. It is already running into problems with the sale of ANL. The unions are squealing about that. In one of the best fudge-its of all, it has written down the price it hopes to receive for selling off the Dasfleet, but it has not taken into account the money that it will have to shell out in leasing it back. What an extraordinary error in a budget paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the Commonwealth Bank, we have the daddy of them all. The government said that it would never sell off that bank. That was back when the government owned 100 per cent of it. That bank was to be the Holy Grail of the ALP, but it sold off 30 per cent in the first tranche. Then, despite promises, it sold off another 20 per cent. We have been left with 50.1 per cent. When the government sold off that last 20 per cent, the then Minister for Finance, the present Treasurer, said in a letter dated 14 September 1993 which was put in the prospectus to shareholders who were buying that last 20 per cent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will reduce its&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the government's&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shareholding in the Bank to not less than 50.1 per cent. The Government has no intentions whatever of further reducing its shareholding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is proud of the Commonwealth Bank's record and looks forward to the Commonwealth of Australia continuing as the Bank's majority shareholder in future. In these circumstances, the obligations and liabilities of the Bank will continue to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is, signed at the bottom by Ralph Willis&mdash;a person whom we all have some high regard for in this place. The prospectus that letter was included in said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the information in the prospectus is accurate and is not misleading. In doing so, the Government has had regard to the prospectus requirements of the corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on further, in an additional information section, to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has no intention whatever of further reducing the Commonwealth of Australia's shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank below 50.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>The prospectus noted that the law&mdash;I suppose that is l-a-w, law&mdash;was being changed to require the government to retain at least 50.1 per cent of the voting power in the Commonwealth Bank. The prospectus went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, neither the Commonwealth nor the Commonwealth Bank will be allowed to do anything to cause or contribute to the Commonwealth no longer holding or controlling the Commonwealth Bank shares carrying the right to exercise at least 50.1 per cent of the total voting rights in the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>Then the prospectus declared that the articles of association required directors not to register a transfer of shares `which would contravene the 50.1 per cent restriction'. The prospectus was signed off by who else&mdash;Ralph Willis `for and on behalf of the Commonwealth'. That was then. A month later Ralph Willis was on the Nine Network's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've made it quite clear in the legislation that went through the Parliament to authorise this sale, that we would not go below the 50.1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>He was asked whether, unlike the last time the government had made a similar commitment when John Kerin was Treasurer&mdash;he had also put it in a similar prospectus letter&mdash;this could be modified or changed in any way and whether he could give an ironclad commitment that there would be no further change. He replied, `Absolutely, yes.' There you have it. I do not know what more ironclad guarantee we could have got from the government. </PARA>

We all know he wants to be Treasurer&mdash;a very noble aspiration. But I ask him: if he has to sink to such depths as this, is it worth it? If he is forced to prostitute his principles in this way, at the end of the day, is it worth it? Perhaps he thinks it is, but for a man of such integrity it must weigh very heavily upon him. </PARA>

I do not think the Treasurer in any way whatsoever should be put in gaol, but these are the sorts of questions people are asking today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the budget neglects is that there is ne'er a word on the current account deficit. Last year the government predicted that the current account deficit would be $18 billion, and it has come in at $27 billion. That is 50 per cent over the prediction. This year it is predicting $27 billion. The mind boggles as to what it might come down at. Nine out of the last 10 months we have had it at over $2 billion. Public debt interest has risen alarmingly to $9.4 billion. That is in excess of 10 times more than we spend federally on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the greatest untruth teller of them all in the history of the Australian parliamentary system&mdash;Paul Keating&mdash;telling us about the tax cuts that we were supposed to get.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government will lower the tax rates over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA>That was said in 1992. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When these tax reforms are complete more than three-quarters of Australian taxpayers will pay no more than 30 per cent on their last dollar of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A 30 per cent tax rate under Labor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he trumpeted, and we know what has happened to that. The One Nation document went on to show in considerable detail how we could earn up to $50,000 and pay no more than a marginal rate of 40c in the dollar. All that has gone by the board. So much for that promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he was asked whether he could ever back off from that promise, the Prime Minister became indignant, put down the questioner and said, `It is legislated. It is law: l-a-w, law.' And that was the end of the matter. That has now been shafted. The bulk of those tax cuts were deferred to 1998, and now they have been bypassed. The Prime Minister is trying to pretend that they have been transferred across to superannuation contributions. There is no linkage whatsoever in that, and that is another fraudulent argument. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in each successive Labor budget, the focus is on equity and social justice, and this budget has achieved that and more. We have brought in a surplus of $718 million. Members of the opposition are spending all their time and effort trying to cut that down by saying, `It is not really that. It is this and it is something else.' A lot of that is unhappiness from their side because they will never be put into a position where they will be able to bring down a budget of any kind, let alone one with a surplus.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear the budget response of the Leader of the Opposition. I have been in this House for a number of years, and I have heard budget responses from Labor opposition leaders and from numerous coalition leaders. I think we reached the high point of parliamentary farce when the opposition spokesperson got up this year because, between this budget and the last budget, we had poor old Alexander who never had a chance to even say anything about a budget. For the first time since I have been here, we have had an opposition leader who did not even survive from one budget to the next. The opposition's budget response last year was made by a member who is no longer with us&mdash;Dr Hewson&mdash;and this year it was made by the member for Bennelong.

Of course, the opposition could not have that. It has time servers like the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who goes along with the National Party line and gets on the front bench. The opposition said to the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a person of principle who actually put a fair bit of effort into his shadow portfolio duties, `Bad luck for you, sport; you get the flick.' That is typical of the attitude of those opposite to most of these issues: they carp; they make personal attacks; they are doing away with people who have any ability; and they are rounding up the same old suspects that the opposition has had sitting here on the front bench year in, year out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has shown that the government is able to rejuvenate itself. After many years in office, the government has come up with what the member for Capricornia described as bold, bright and beautiful policies. The opposition and its colleagues in Victoria, Western Australia and until recently the failed Fahey government in New South Wales would like to be able to emulate the figures in this budget themselves. We said that we would rein in the deficit, and we delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Leader of the Opposition's response to the budget, he said very little. One normally comes in and listens to what the opposition leader has to say in reply to the budget. One would have thought that, particularly in a year where some time between now and the next budget we can expect an election, that would be the time when the Leader of the Opposition would have outlined where he thought the opposition might wish to take the country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we get from the opposition is carping over the so-called extra taxes that it reckons the government has imposed. Members of the opposition say, `Isn't it terrible that people have lost their tax cuts? The government has taken away their tax cuts.' Those opposite can carry on like that as much as they like. Contrary to their cynical perception about the stupidity and gullibility of the public, our constituents have enough commonsense to see that those tax cuts would be better spent and better used if they were converted into national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hypocrisy of the opposition is demonstrated by the fact that all we have heard in the past has been how terrible it was that we did not have a pool of national savings; and now that the government has developed a very large pool of national savings, all we hear from the opposition is that the benefit should have been given as tax cuts. Those opposite do not remember what they said in the past and their problem is that we remember what they said in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia know that the government, through the provision of superannuation, has ensured that they can expect a retirement income nearly twice that provided by the current age pension. In facilitating access to better self-provision of retirement incomes and superannuation, the government has enabled future governments to sustain and improve age pension benefits for the most disadvantaged people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the south-west region of Sydney, which is the area I represent, we have a very large number of people over the age of 65. In fact, some statistics suggest that we have the highest concentration of pensioners of any electorate in the metropolitan area of Sydney. Figures also show that the number of people aged 65 will increase by 23 per cent by the year 2001. The Canterbury and St George districts have a very high concentration of people who rely on the government services that are provided for in this budget; services such as the health programs and the social security system. Those people will benefit from the provision in future of superannuation payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who are at present over 65 will also benefit considerably from the government's decision to support and improve Medicare. While the opposition runs around and says that by increasing the Medicare levy the government has increased taxes, the people of my electorate are convinced about the benefits of Medicare and would rather see this marginal increase in the Medicare levy to ensure that</PARA>
<PARA>Medicare remains a viable proposition. The increase in the levy to 1.5 per cent will ensure that it makes a greater contribution to the cost of government health programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should remember that in 1988 the receipts from the levy accounted for 30 per cent of the Medicare outlays. Last year, the receipts from the levy only accounted for 25 per cent of Medicare outlays. Even with an increase in the levy of 0.1 per cent it will still only account for 27 per cent of the Medicare outlays. The government has taken the middle line of increasing the levy by a small amount to ensure that Medicare stays a viable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents know that they are getting value for money in relation to Medicare. They are even more pleased with the health system in our district since the New South Wales Labor government was elected. It pledged to keep Canterbury Hospital open and to expand it so that it becomes a better health care system for people of the Canterbury and St George districts of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the major expenditure on health in this year's budget focuses on preventive health care. Some $18 million has been allocated to the health Australia program to reduce tobacco use, especially among young people. I could not think of a more principled thing for the government to do than announce, which the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) did yesterday, that the government will be discouraging cigarette companies from being associated with the Olympics. It has always seemed to me to be ridiculous that cigarette companies try to attach themselves as sponsors for the Olympics when it is to be a celebration of health excellence. To have the Olympics sponsored by companies that produce something that kills you and is very unhealthy strikes me as silly. The government is going to spend $18 million in an attempt to wean young people off smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health budget also includes a provision for $42 million to be spent over the next four years to continue the national cervical cancer screening program with particular emphasis on increasing participation. Just as that program is important for women, so is the provision to spend $25 million over the next two years on a program to encourage more children to be immunised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These types of education programs are extremely important in an electorate like mine where there are a large number of new migrants who, due often to the lack of these services in their country of origin, do not know of the importance of immunisation and cervical cancer screening. These two programs will very remarkably improve the healthiness of the people of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one of the best things about this budget for the people of my electorate, both for their health and for their transportation problems, is the fact that extra money has been provided for the construction of Sydney West airport at Badgerys Creek. The $726 million of funding is something that both the member for Grayndler (Ms McHugh), who is at the table, and I are very pleased to see. Quite frankly, for far too long the people of inner Sydney have paid the price that commuters who do not live anywhere near them do not pay&mdash;that is, the noise. The construction of Sydney West airport will be of great benefit to them. Provisions have been made in the budget to extend the runway at Sydney West to ensure international aircraft can fully utilise the facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again: Qantas must be told that it has to use that airport. James Strong and his cohorts at Qantas cannot get away with saying that they wish to continue to use only Sydney airport. To have Australia's national airline try to desert the people of western Sydney is a disgrace. The people at Qantas have to realise that Sydney West is there for both them and others. If they think they are going to be put in a position where they can say that Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is going to become Sydney (Qantas) Airport, and that the commuters and everybody else ought to move out, they have another think coming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Sydney airport already reaching capacity limits during peak periods of the day, and with extra demand expected for the Olympics, it is extremely important that the construction of the second airport be carried out quickly. The funding in the budget is a bonus for the people of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents will also benefit as a result of the improved transport infrastructure, both road and rail, which will be put in with the new Sydney West airport. The road and rail links are designed to improve connections between both the airports and those people in the intermediary areas. The road links are important for us because they will remove many of the semitrailers from our local and arterial roads, which will free up the maze of links on which locals are fighting with semitrailers at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike most residential areas, people in my electorate in the main want the M5 completed. Due to the inept planning of the former New South Wales Liberal government, which could not get it done let alone plan it right, heavy through traffic has been dumped in Beverly Hills, a suburb of my electorate, right in the midst of a residential area. It is ridiculous that this freeway stops at a set of lights. There is no extension to it because the state Liberals never got around to finishing the job. They botched it up so badly that sections of the M5 which are now open go from two lanes to one, and we have already seen bad accidents there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the state government builds this link, it would be far preferable to continue the tunnelling right up to Beverly Hills and not have the road above ground. I would hope that the state government would consider that option, which was an option that I put forward to the M5 inquiry last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government will be working very closely with the New South Wales government to ensure that these road and rail links are in place as soon as possible. An amount of $260 million has been provided in the budget for the road links and there has been money provided in other parts of the budget last year for the rail links. The rail link between the two airports will see the East Hills line upgraded and extended. That will be a significant bonus for the people of the Watson electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the location of my electorate halfway between Kingsford Smith and Sydney West will provide a number of business opportunities for people in the industrial area of my electorate. The Kingsgrove industrial estate, for instance, could become an important hub for freight utilising its central location between the two airports and on the way to the Botany Bay port. I think the member for Capricornia got the summation of the budget right when she described it as being `bold, bright and beautiful'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the opposition can see that, if it is going to get a chance to govern this country, it has to start being positive about a few things. The government believes that the framework in this budget is certainly something with which we can confidently go to the people between now and the next budget. We have been able to deliver the goods over the years, and this budget shows that we are still able to do that. I commend the bill to the House. I thank the House. </PARA>

He refers specifically to the coalition carping about the budget and so on. I probably have a different perspective. I believe that `telling the truth about some of the matters in the budget' is a more accurate description.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the honourable gentleman spent about 25 per cent of his time talking about our leadership problems and who our Treasurers were and so on, rather than actually dealing with his own government's budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to the honourable gentleman also that he had some positive things to say about measures in the budget which I would also agree with. I would make it clear up front, for example, that any measures in relation to tobacco and discouraging people from smoking are to be commended. Today happens to be 31 May, International No Tobacco Day, no smoking day. It is, therefore, very appropriate that this topic be brought up in this chamber on 31 May, as International No Tobacco Day. As one who gave up smoking at five to eight on Friday, 14 April 1978&mdash;you can tell that I do not miss it, but I will not go back to it&mdash;I have to say I am one of those awful people who, having become a convert, are prepared to speak quite publicly on the subject about measures to stop young people taking up smoking. </PARA>

They only ever give us coverage of the negative things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make a couple of other points. When it is said that people would rather have the tax cuts&mdash;the l-a-w tax cuts which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised before the last election&mdash;than superannuation, that they recognise the need to do away with them and so on and so forth and would the coalition continue to have those tax cuts, when we criticise what you have done, we are talking about the fact that you have broken your word to the Australian people. We are not talking about whether it is a good thing to have a superannuation scheme; we are saying that you went to an election making promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we challenged you about the promise, the Prime Minister stood up and said to the people of this nation that the tax cuts were legislated, that they were l-a-w, that they were in law. He made an absolute definite promise. In the same way, the Minster for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), a lady who has come into this place recently and with a high reputation, said previously that there would be no increase in the Medicare levy. It may be perfectly appropriate to increase the Medicare levy but, having said publicly within the last few months that there would be no change, and then to make that change, we are criticising the absence of telling the truth on the part of government ministers and the people who run this country. That is the message that has to get out to the community: telling the truth in public life is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, when we talk about the deficit and those on the government side say there is a surplus of $700-odd million, we point out that on page 7.3 of Budget Paper No. 1 it clearly says that, apart from when we sell off capital items, assets, the farm, the real budget deficit is $8.4 billion. It is in your own budget papers. So when we talk surpluses let us be clear about what we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the newspapers and the media tend to talk in large measure about the big, eye-catching items, one of the things we often lose sight of in this place is our individual and collective responsibility as members of parliament to our communities. This is one of the problems with governments that have been there for a long time. Often, public servants&mdash;and I am not one who buckets all public servants; many of them do a fine job&mdash;who are based in Canberra and who spend too much time in Canberra lose sight of what it is like out there in the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are one or two areas I come across in my daily getting around the community, in my electorate and around the country, that get overlooked sometimes in that big picture. I quote, for example, the case of disabled children. I have a number of disabled children in my electorate who under integration programs need additional funding either directly or by having integration aides provided. The Victorian requirement for assisting disabled children for integration aides was $1.5 million. The government provided a miserable $750,000, half of the requirement. In all the billions of dollars that go into the federal budget it seems to me that that is a derisory amount. We ought to be more concerned with some of those on-the-ground programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently in Sydney with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. We visited a very worthwhile institution there, a dance troupe and training group which has been there for some years and which the government has announced will `move to Brisbane'. There has been no consideration of the families, no consideration of the expertise that is not going to be available in Brisbane&mdash;just a willy-nilly `let us distribute it around the country'. The government is going to cut off the funding of that group in Sydney from the end of this coming month, June. We have had a lot of government rhetoric over the years about helping indigenous people and here we have a very worthwhile indigenous group that is going to be chopped off at the knees. Where is the help in the budget for people like that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we look at small business. I have to say that I despair of this government in terms of small business and, as I move around in my electorate, most of the 6,000 small businesses there despair. I do not think there is a fundamental understanding by the government of what it takes to run your own business in today's society. There really are no measures in this budget that will help the small business community. Yet we have somewhere between 750,000 and 800,000 small businesses in Australia. If there were some measures in this budget to help that sector of the community to enable them all to prosper just that little bit more and employ just one more person, we would effectively wipe out the queues of unemployed. But this government does not understand that. This government has, in fact, attacked small business in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to other social issues. We heard the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is responsible for that abomination of administration called the Child Support Agency, stand up in this place in question time yesterday and say that, having had a very comprehensive report from a parliamentary committee on the failings of that institution, the government is now consulting to decide what its response will be. For heaven's sake, 40 per cent of the marriages in this country by the year 2000 will end in divorce. Thousands of children are involved, hundreds of thousands of people, and yet we see no response in the budget or elsewhere from this government to address those very real and urgent issues in the Family Court and the child support areas. It seems to me that, in terms of issues that touch men and women in the street, across this nation, this government is out of touch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my colleagues have talked about some of the broad issues&mdash;and I am not going to dwell on them at length. But let us just have a quick reminder of some of the main facets of this budget. What we are seeing, of course, is an increase in the government's own growth and spending. Excluding asset sales, spending for the government's own outlays grew by 1.7 per cent in real terms from $122.5 billion to $129.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, in this budget an excessive reliance on asset sales to try to balance the budget, with sales of assets in 1995-96 estimated at $5.35 billion. It is all very well to plan to sell off some assets to balance the books and try to get the deficit down, but of course the government has tried this trick before. Since 1990-91, the government has forecast the selling of some $8 billion worth of assets but has fallen well short of that rhetoric because it has only managed to actually sell about $3.8 billion. I think the government has sold Qantas four times now&mdash;and you cannot keep putting the same figure in the books time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, having only sold $3.8 billion worth of assets in the last five years, now expects to sell over $5 billion this year. Of course, there is already doubt over the asset sales program with the first sale on the books, ANL, having running into stiff opposition from the trade union movement&mdash;and that is really in some doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dasfleet is another of the entities that the government is going to get rid of. Unfortunately, we have seen some double accounting with Dasfleet, the business having been sold off with one hand and the money from the sale having been brought on to the ledger but, at the same time, with the government also showing that it is getting revenue from Dasfleet's daily operation&mdash;after having sold the business off. So let us talk about some reality, some honesty and some integrity in the accounting process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax increases in this budget will increase taxation by $2.4 billion in 1995-96, rising to $7.8 billion in the tax year 1998-99. That is a huge slug on the Australian people. Individual measures include the increase in the company tax rate&mdash;`only from 33 per cent to 36 per cent', says the government. But that is actually a rise of around 11 per cent in the company tax rate. That will raise over $300 million in the current financial year. Over four years, it will raise nearly $4,000 million. So, just as many small and medium sized companies start to get back on their feet after the recession, they now will be slugged with an extra increase in their taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already heard a little bit today about the Medicare levy. As I said before, one of my concerns there is that the minister concerned made public statements about not increasing the Medicare levy only in the last few months. But, of course, they have been shown to be untrue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax has gone up on motor vehicles. That is going to adversely impact on the motor industry in this country, which is already struggling to survive. Then we have the infamous extension of sales tax into the building materials area&mdash;a GST for the building industry is what it boils down to&mdash;at the rate of 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, how often have you and I sat in this chamber and listened to the government harangue, bucket and criticise&mdash;whatever word you like to use&mdash;this side of the House for its GST proposals? Despite the fact that they are dead and history&mdash;we lost the election and we publicly dumped them&mdash;almost every day that the Prime Minister deigns to come in here, which is not too often, he rakes up the subject of the GST. Yet here we have this government imposing 12 per cent on all of those building materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will affect the house building industry and those in the business of house extensions. Every handyman who pops down to the local hardware store on a Saturday to buy the bits and pieces to do little jobs around the house is going to be hit by that 12 per cent. The Master Builders Association and the Housing Industry Association have already said that the government has deliberately understated the impact on householders of this particular measure in its calculations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go on and talk about the problem with debt and the deficit. The low level of national savings has given us significant current account problems. The latest figure of $2.25 billion for one month, which came out just in the last couple of days, is another reminder of why action should have been taken to cut back on government spending at least a year ago, if not two years ago, rather than waiting till now to actually start doing something about it; and then only lifting taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In nine out of the last 10 months this country has gone another $2 billion into the red. One of the things that frighten me about the national debt, which has gone from around $10 billion or $15 billion a decade ago to nearer $200 billion today, is that the markets, the people and the journalists react in terms of market expectation. If you say, `I am going to have a huge catastrophe,' and you do not have quite such a huge catastrophe, everybody says, `What is the problem?' The problem is that we are still getting into debt by a huge amount month after month. The government's own budget papers say that next year we are going to have another $27 billion added. There is no attempt to actually fix the problem but only an acknowledgment that it is going to stay there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) went on television to try to sell his budget and he was asked about that, he said, `In percentage terms of the gross domestic product it has gone down by half a per cent, so that is an improvement.' But it is still a huge amount of money we are borrowing from overseas. The result is that we have to spend great chunks of our money paying interest on that debt&mdash;not paying off the debt, but paying interest on that debt&mdash;to overseas interests. That is money which, if it was not going there, could be spent in this country on hospitals, roads, aged care programs and so on. Of course the coalition is going to criticise this budget, because it does not attack the fundamentals and it does not tell us honestly what the situation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It is an overwhelmingly young electorate with per capita incomes below the national average but household incomes above. That is because both husband and wife are working. The reason so many of them are working is that I have more mortgage payers than any other electorate in the country, so they are working to pay off their mortgages. I have 6,000-odd small businesses. This budget is absolutely bad news for them. There is a lot of house building going on because it is an expansion area. The 12 per cent tax on building materials is going to adversely affect so many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of debt we are continuing to escalate means that we are going to continue to borrow from overseas and pressure will come back on interest rates. That affects every one of my mortgage payers and it affects most of those small businesses. The increase in taxation and so on that the small businesses themselves have to face is going to be real bad news for all of those small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment in my electorate in the 12 years since this government came to power has gone up by 657 per cent. That is what this government's policies are doing to the people of Australia, to the middle ground of Australia. The government is continuing to do the same thing because it will not get its own spending under control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retail trade figures for April have just come out. They are running at a high 4.6 per cent. We are told, `But that's abnormal.

Next month there is some other abnormal item. For this government, there is always some abnormal excuse. The bottom line is that we are getting deeper and deeper into debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess we should get used to that kind of rhetoric from those opposite, but after a while negativity seems to repeat on itself and people lose all perspective. Some of those figures used by the previous speaker, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), are quite suspect and unworthy of him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the annual budget process, which is the major opportunity for both the parliament and the community to focus on the national economy, the first thing we should always look at is the process of forecasting and the forecasts themselves. This is always problematic. In virtually every Western society, the difficulties experienced by economists, treasuries and finance departments in accurately assessing and forecasting what is going to occur not only in their own economies but also in the global economy have increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing more and more fluctuations, higher levels of volatility and quite substantial variations from projections. Within that volatility we also see potential for the doomsayers to exaggerate and distort. I well recall how, when the government forecast investment growth of some 15 per cent in last year's budget, that was scoffed at and mocked by those opposite as being a ludicrous figure. Almost every speaker opposite in last year's debate on the appropriation legislation referred to a lack of confidence; worse than that, I think many imputed downright fraudulence in the projection for business investment. With hindsight, the government vastly underestimated business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at this year's forecasts, which are important, we are seeing an attempt&mdash;and I trust the forecasters will be accurate&mdash;to flatten out the economic cycles. It does not matter how far one goes back in our economy, one can see periodic cycles of boom and bust and the difficulty that we have experienced in balancing and harmonising our capacity to produce with our capacity to consume. In the late 1980s, we had a four per cent gap between our production and our consumption. That four per cent gap, of course, was filled by imports which in turn led to a contraction in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gap at the moment is of the order of two per cent, and with this year's budget that gap will reduce quite substantially. It may well be that we end up with a lineball, very balanced result. It is extremely difficult for the forecasters and the economists to predict that accurately, because we are subject to an enormous number of variables like the Japanese economy, the American economy and the European economy. All of these economies feed through in terms not only of our suppliers but also investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major aspect of the budget that I think we should look at in that context is the very strong focus by the government on increasing Australian savings. Historically we have used world savings. From the first settlement by Europeans we have used overseas funds from firstly the British, then the Americans and now to some degree the Japanese and other Asian investors. We have tended not to invest in our own country and we have tended not to have a large pool of domestic savings. That is changing and I think this budget will change it even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects of policy changes over previous years are now coming through. For instance, with dividend imputation we now deduct tax once rather than twice, as we used to. Under the capital gains tax, any form of income by speculation is now taxed, whereas in previous times it was not. That produced a massive bias in the investment policies and investment strategies of Australians towards investing in speculation and speculative ventures such as land rezoning and land upvaluing rather than in production. We are also seeing a continued commitment to research and development and to innovation coming through in government policies and I think it will eventually come through more and more in our trade figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention some particular areas, but I will talk first about the changes in social policy. These again are important changes. The introduction of a maternity allowance, which will cost $643 million over four years and provide a lump sum payment of over $800 to some 80 per cent of Australian families who have a child, is an important policy. The extension of the better cities program is important. The social justice package, the global figure for which was announced in the budget but more detail of which has been received in more recent days, is also important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the treatment of investments by pensioners is one of the most dramatic changes and is certainly one of the most positive ones. We have grappled with this for very many years. Part of it dates back to the Fraser government decision in the 1970s to take assets out of the pension system and to allow people to convert their income into capital growth. That change by that government was a very bad policy change. I think those opposite nowadays often admit that, whereas they were reluctant to earlier on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is difficulty in assessing income from pensioner investments when they can invest in such a variety of instruments. The ingenuity of the investment community in devising new and cleverer ways to avoid those procedures has been quite staggering. So, each time there was a new constraint, the investment community would find a new loophole or a new way around it. Quite frankly, the victims of those devices were largely pensioners who were gulled into new devices and into new procedures to try to achieve more income. In many cases they ended up much worse off. Particularly galling were those people who advised people to invest in areas long after government announcements had precluded those areas from exclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the deeming provisions in July next year for investments, in whatever form they are, will be an enormous improvement and will vastly simplify the processes. They do provide one danger and one must be warning our pensioner community that higher investments, higher returns and higher yields usually mean higher risks. There is a very real danger that some pensioners may be persuaded to invest in riskier investments on the advice of their advisers who often get a commission on those investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not wishing to bag the whole investment advisory community, but some commission-led advisers advise pensioners perhaps more because they are dictated to by their own commission rather than by pensioners' security. It is important that pensioners investing in higher yielding activities be very wary and very mindful of the high risk that they run. In the past we have seen enough examples of organisations going bankrupt and destroying the savings base of very many Australian pensioners. I trust the introduction of deeming provisions for pension investments will not increase the possibility of that happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect is changes to carers allowances. It will take a while for those changes to work their way through to the community, but over time they will become extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to a couple of aspects of the budgetary provisions. I mentioned earlier the extension of the building better cities program. I place on record my appreciation for this program as it operates in Newcastle. In Newcastle we have experienced a Commonwealth contribution of some $17 million over four years. Despite the complications of a state Liberal government quite determined to distort that program and some of the weaknesses in the legislation establishing various administrative bodies and so on, the Newcastle community is seeing benefits from those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the benefits could be greater, and the program more effective. I certainly encourage members throughout the country whose areas may be eligible for this program to recognise its potential, to be positive about its benefits and to see the funding not as some pot of gold that is somehow being delivered but rather as a vehicle for really constructive change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need an attitudinal change within the community, within governments and within the investment community so that our older cities and our older communities can be rejuvenated and revived in a constructive and positive way. We need to achieve these things, and that will take a lot of goodwill and a lot of flexibility in attitude. I am certainly confident Newcastle is achieving some quite important changes. Although the real results will not be seen for perhaps another four or five years after the program is finished, the attitudinal changes are extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriations in the budget also provide $152 million this year for the minehunter acquisition program. This program relates to the project by Australian Defence Industries based in Newcastle for the provision of minehunters to the Australian navy. Firstly, the ADI, having come to Newcastle four months ago, has turned out to be a splendid corporate citizen. It has fitted in extremely well with our industrial community and our broader community. It is proving to be a very good and sensitive neighbour to people who live nearby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our community ADI is introducing both jobs and, more importantly, technology and skills which have enormous potential. I am excited by its approach. I am certainly delighted that it is talking at this early stage to overseas navies with prospects of exporting not just its material but its technology and possibly its vessels. ADI has come forward as a company with a great deal of credibility and has become a very important part of our industrial community and an extremely good corporate citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention the Working Nation projects under way. The whole Working Nation program is enormously important. It is important in terms of the recovery coming through and reductions in unemployment. Firstly, in our older centres, particularly our older industrial areas, unemployment is not being reduced at the same rate as in the more aggressive and more buoyant parts of the economy. The unemployment rate in Newcastle and the Hunter is still well above the national average. We must keep working at that. Therefore, we must not lose perspective. The fact that it is not as great a problem as it may have been a couple of years ago is no cause for lessening our efforts, particularly in terms of the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation is now starting to have effects in the Hunter. I encourage not just the unemployed to take the program seriously and to recognise its potential but, more importantly, organisations, local government and the business community to recognise that the unemployed in their community are also part of their responsibility</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see a much stronger response from the business community. It should pick up some of these programs because they can, in fact, aid business. They have the potential to provide new work opportunities, training wages and a whole range of other aspects of Working Nation. The flexibility is there; the goodwill that is available, I think, can help businesses grow. At the moment those in the business community have not really understood the full potential of these programs and how they can allow them to take on employees, in the short term with some assistance; which in the long term will allow their businesses to grow and keep those people on permanently as fully productive members of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one goes around looking at projects, organisations and individuals who have been engaged in programs such as LEAP, jobskills and jobstart, it is interesting to note the number of employers who say that the long-term unemployed person they have employed has been very productive. Many employers have expressed surprise that these people have been so good because they had assumed that because they were long-term unemployed they were, therefore, incompetent and unable to be productive. But, given a chance, these people have proved themselves to be worthy and fully contributing members of the work force and, more importantly in many ways, very grateful members. So the level of loyalty to the organisation and the level of commitment that these people bring to a company are often greater because they have had that handicap of being long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go now to an announcement that was made today by National Rail of its preferred tenderer for its major locomotive contract. It has announced this morning that the preferred tenderer is Goninan. Mr Deputy Speaker Vaile, I am sure you would be pleased to hear that, given that it has some very important facilities in your electorate. This contract, which is worth some $400 million in initial value, is, in fact, a national contract. It is not just in Newcastle, although the brain power, as I put it, is there; but it is a truly national project spanning across to Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and also up north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It matches very well the concept of National Rail being, for the first time, a national rail system. I think the first train went on the national rail tracks in recent days. But for the first time, after 94 years of federation, we are seeing a national organisation; we are finally getting to a national rail system. As I said, the announcement by National Rail today of Goninan as its preferred tenderer will bring in an initial $400 million. I suspect the 15-year maintenance contract will be of not much less value. This is exciting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This follows on very well from the defence projects such as minehunters, submarines and frigates, in which we have tried to give national projects to Australian companies to use as building blocks for international industries. It is important to understand that at the moment Goninan, in its relationships with GE, currently has export contracts&mdash;in supplies of rolling stock and design&mdash;of some $20 million with Thailand and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people spoke about the manufacturing industry in the 1960s, it was almost predominantly only overseas designs and overseas licences in Australia. So we were using overseas equipment to make things for our domestic market. What we have been trying to do in recent years has been to ensure that the design capacity of intellectual properties in Australia is here. We have certainly achieved that in the defence industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing this in the national rail project. This project will give not just a national perspective to our locomotive manufacturing and rail system; it will also position a company of the quality of Goninan as a platform for exports, which I expect, over time, may end up being worth much more than this project is worth because it gives them that base and the credibility to work from. The government has been pursuing the idea of using our system or our needs as a platform for externalising and internationalising some of our companies and this has been coming through in so many different areas; for example, pharmaceutical, TCF, defence and now transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Goninan is now in team with GE. It is an international player of enormous quality. I certainly offer my congratulations to John Fitzgerald and all his team. I know that they put up with enormous difficulties. It was a very difficult tender&mdash;it was enormously complex&mdash;with fierce competition. The fact that that business team has been successful means that it is at the forefront of international developments in locomotive design and manufacturing. I think the benefits will eventually be more important in the export market than the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the budget, we now have an international economy which we cannot insulate from what is happening in the world. That is why it is often so difficult to project and predict what will happen. What happens in America and Japan in the next few weeks will affect Australia a few weeks later&mdash;although, nowadays, it is a few hours later because it is that quick. We have tried to respond to that with international forums and our international perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin, we have also tried to position our companies to be international players. Unless we recognise that the world is our market&mdash;and not just Australia&mdash;we will always be at the short end. I expect that the National Rail decision and the potential it gives will be one more step towards helping us to establish a trade balance for the very first time where we can move towards skills based, intellectually based exports of the nature that Goninan is capable of, rather than simply relying on resources. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Now all the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) can do is whine about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) being a man of broken promises&mdash;the great deceiver&mdash;and the bloke who turned l-a-w tax cuts into tax cuts l-i-e.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Qantas debate raged, key members of the Left argued that working people had little affinity with, or use for, airlines. To appease the economic rationalists, the government originally restricted foreign ownership in any Qantas float to 35 per cent. Now, and no-one is surprised, foreign ownership is to be lifted to 49 per cent because, we are told, all the ownership and control objectives will still be met if 49 per cent of Qantas is in foreign hands. So much for Qantas maintaining its Australian character. So much for the PM calling others lickspittles. So much for the independent republican Australia, which the Prime Minister crows about daily.

Like most coalition members, the member for Mackellar prefers to wave an Australian flag and engage in cheap jingoism than to actually endorse policies which promote economic sovereignty or Australian ownership. Again, predictably, her ire is raised not because of her aversion to foreign ownership but because it is the Labor Party's mates&mdash;John Singleton et al&mdash;who she claims might make a dollar out of the Qantas float. </PARA>

One wonders how many Labor icons have to be decapitated or buried before the Labor Party finally admits that it has severed its connection with the past and become a fully fledged Liberal Party. Workers employed by the Commonwealth Bank will be only too aware that the sale of the State Bank in Victoria resulted in the closure of over 200 branches.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the appropriation bills is a good time to examine the differences between the government and the opposition. The appropriation bills will fund the policies and programs of the government for the coming year. In contrast, the opposition is not prepared to engage in dialogue with the Australian people on policies. It has no responsible or open policy making processes. The faceless men of its public relations consultancies make Liberal Party policies. Generally, prejudice and popularism are the Liberal Party's guiding principles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prejudice leads the Liberal Party to demand fiscal constraint in the budget. Popularism leads the Liberal Party to oppose all tax measures in the budget. Together these views mean that the opposition must be prepared to cut government expenditure. During the last federal election campaign the opposition campaigned under a policy document called Fightback. Fightback spelt out very clearly that a Liberal-National Party in government would slash government expenditure by $10,000 million. Within that $10,000 million, over a three-year period $850 million would be slashed from expenditure on defence. That was the choice facing the Australian people at the last federal election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget itself represents a very substantial fiscal tightening&mdash;$15 billion has been cut from the government's borrowing requirement. These cuts involve a real reduction in the running costs of departments and agencies worth $662 million over four years. The market response to the government's budget has been positive and interest rates have been lowered. But in its desperation to attract funds from the business community for its federal election campaign, the opposition hints that it would have been tougher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition suggests that in government it would have managed tighter fiscal policy. But the opposition's record stands against it. When the opposition was last in government it never displayed the fiscal responsibility of this Labor government. I recall when I was first elected that the deficit we inherited from the Fraser-Howard government, in 1983 dollar terms, was $9.6 billion. The opposition's popularism principles also stand against it. How credible are opposition claims of fiscal responsibility when on the revenue side it refuses to address tax issues and on the expenditure side it refuses to identify the areas of expenditure that it would cut in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Fightback the Liberal Party's prejudices towards expenditure cuts were exposed. On industry policy, the opposition said that enterprise improvement programs such as those administered through AusIndustry would be better handled by the states. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me assure you that the efforts by the states to develop the fundamental building blocks of industrial competitiveness have been relatively very minor. It is the federal government that has provided programs to enhance industrial science and technology, innovation, best practice and export access. Indeed, many state governments of both political persuasions simply administer federal government initiated programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal government enterprise improvement programs are coordinated through AusIndustry, which works cooperatively with the states and the private sector in delivering these programs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My good friend the current opposition industry spokesman, the member for Ryan (Mr Moore), I suspect has inherited some of those Liberal Party prejudices on the value of AusIndustry programs. In a media release dated 2 March this year he described the streamlining of government enterprise improvement programs under AusIndustry following the Burgess review as `fiddling at the edges', while failing to address the fundamental problems confronting Australian industry. The issues according to my good friend the member for Ryan were business taxation, industrial relations, competition policy and inefficient national economic infrastructure. The absence of any opposition policies in these areas must therefore be of some embarrassment to my colleague the member for Ryan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My challenge to members of the opposition is to produce the policies they would take to the Australian people and let the Australian people examine those policies and make a judgment of them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to outline the policies and programs of the industry, science and technology portfolio that support the appropriations contained in the appropriation bills. This government has maintained a commitment to a vision of Australia as a confident, energetic and successful participant in the global economy. That has been our determination, our vision. Inspired by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), the industry, science and technology portfolio plays a vital role in providing the leadership necessary to deal with contemporary and emerging issues affecting the industrial and technological development of this country. The portfolio is responsible for devising and implementing policy and programs to facilitate the development of competitive manufacturing and service enterprises within a business environment and building a world class science and technology base in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation for the industry, science and technology portfolio for the next financial year totals $2.8 billion, about the same level as the last financial year. The appropriation will allow the portfolio to continue the momentum of established policies and programs designed to encourage Australian industry and firms to become more internationally competitive. This budget also provides the portfolio with the appropriations necessary to continue the implementation of major initiatives announced in Working Nation last May, some $64 million worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to stress that the Keating government places continuing strong emphasis on delivering the industry, science and technology programs more efficiently and more effectively, providing better value for money for the Australian taxpayer. We recognise the need for restraint in this year's budget. We have placed priority on ensuring that the new policy proposals are fully offset by savings from within the portfolio. It is an admirable achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now look to the overview of the industry, science and technology portfolio, truly a powerhouse for economic development in this country. In regard to government appropriations divided amongst the portfolio agencies, the outlays by category are: for the department, about 24 per cent; for the science agencies, about 18 per cent; for the Australian Customs Service, about 12 per cent; and for the diesel fuel rebate scheme, which is administered by the Australian Customs Service&mdash;of great moment in country Australia&mdash;45 per cent. The government is, therefore, addressing areas where the markets fail to provide what we expect&mdash;optimum outcomes. They include deficiencies in the flow of information and the level of research and development and the adoption of new technology, particularly in industry. These are subjects honourable members have heard me talk about on many occasions in this House&mdash;the flow of information, the appallingly low level of private sector research and development and the need to adopt new technology, particularly in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the science agencies comes under consideration from time to time in this House. Support for research and development is one example of where we are trying and succeeding in an area where the market traditionally fails or underprovides. Funding to the science agencies&mdash;CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science at Townsville and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation&mdash;is granted normally on a triennial basis. This provides a more stable financial environment and a more realistic time frame for resource planning in scientific research, which often involves activities that extend beyond normal annual budget cycles. An appropriation of $416 million has been earmarked for scientific and industrial research programs administered by CSIRO. The government has set CSIRO a target of 30 per cent self-funding, which is helping to orient the research program towards the commercial interests of the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1995-96, CSIRO's management and structure will be evaluated, and its strategic plan will be revised to encourage the most efficient use of research and development funding. CSIRO will continue its efforts to enhance and upgrade its relationships with customers and stakeholders to improve its business practices, commercialisation procedures and research support services. The research effort, including strategic research for the sustainable long-term growth of industries and short-term research and development project work with firms, will continue to focus on nominated priority areas&mdash;and this is very important. A stated objective on behalf of the government is to ensure that taxpayers' money continues to be employed in a way that provides value and useable outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important area within the portfolio which needs to be addressed continually is the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. That organisation is responsible for the industrial property program, which provides effective property right protection for inventions, trademarks and designs in Australia. It does this in a very cost-effective manner and is pursuing a target of 100 per cent cost recovery. Demand for industrial property services, particularly trademarks, increased substantially in the last financial year, and this trend is expected to increase into 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the review of the trademarks legislation, new legislation will come into effect on 1 January next year. We will consider the review of the Australian design and petty patents systems. The latter review will consider whether small inventors have effective access to intellectual property protection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the Conroy review, the Australian Customs Service has undergone major reform to enable it to better focus on client needs and increased efficiencies. It is developing stronger and wider consultative mechanisms with partners and clients. It is very conscious of its international responsibilities, particularly within the APEC forum. It is very responsive also to calls for it to change its culture, to become much more effective in its dealings, and to establish stronger bonds with its clients and partners in administering a number of government programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department's objective is not only to efficiently manage and support these agencies but also to ensure that industry and the science community are provided with the necessary policies and programs that will help Australian industry and science to accelerate their internationalisation and assist the Australian economy in being able to cope with increasing internationalisation. The policies for industry and science must focus on factors critical for firms to compete in the international marketplace&mdash;not only within Australia but also within the international marketplace&mdash;if this country is to continue its economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding for the Department of Industry, Science and Technology portfolio was therefore sought to support policies and programs which are in place and working effectively and also, at the same time, to facilitate the development of a competitive business environment&mdash;that is, to provide that helping hand of assistance to industry, to the private sector, to assist them in becoming much more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to AusIndustry, 1994 saw the federal government introduce a new approach to the delivery of government enterprise development services to industry.

AusIndustry will place a strong emphasis on providing a client focused and integrated delivery of enterprise development services to optimise opportunities for Australian companies to have the necessary information for their continued growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to the Burgess report placed AusIndustry as the primary delivery mechanism for all the federal government's domestic business improvement programs.

This is a very important initiative by the government in trying to streamline and make more efficient the mechanisms for the delivery of these particular programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major priority of AusIndustry over the next 12 months will be the implementation of the Burgess report recommendations which focus on issues of rationalisation and better program delivery&mdash;in other words, industry becoming involved with AusIndustry and delivering those programs with a private sector mentality and attitude to ensure that the taxpayer and private industry in this country get the value that we seek for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, as a key part of the AusIndustry program we have launched Bizhelp, the computer based directory of Commonwealth and state government assistance. This will prove of immeasurable benefit to small businesses in accessing federal and state government information on a whole range of programs. The program is upgraded every three months. It costs $200 and is available in lawyers' offices, banks and accountants' offices.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back again to the science and technology program allocation for 1995-96 of $163 million.

We believe that, through successful commercialisation, the conversion of more of our existing research and development into a competitive edge is absolutely fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have increased collaboration between researchers, and active involvement of research users, through the cooperative research program&mdash;five of which are in my own electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not permit me to canvass a lot of important issues dealing with innovation and other budget initiatives in the statement, but I would like to conclude on the following issues. The outlook for the Australian economy and industry is very promising over the next few years, particularly with the growth in the American economy and falling interest rates in that country, which have an effect on this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budget forecasts predict that economic growth will continue to be around 3.75 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let the speech of my colleague the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) go by without some very brief remark. In his speech he touched on the supposed lack of any economic credibility on the part of the coalition because of a lack of policies. I find it extraordinary that he does not realise that the shoe is actually on the other foot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made promises of economic forecasts year in year out, almost none of which have ever turned out to be true. It then turns around and says that the opposition does not have any economic credibility. We now have a Prime Minister who is claiming six years of growth. For goodness sake! If the Australian people have not worked out yet that these things are always said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) before elections and then broken after, then I do not know what they will think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When budget time comes around we know that the Prime Minister, in his immortal words, is about to throw the switch to vaudeville. The performance might not be as spectacular as the 1988 show, but each year we can expect a big production number. This year has been no exception. The Prime Minister has staged yet another of his all-singing, all-dancing extravaganzas, taken it on the road, and even run around the press gallery chivvying out reluctant journalists to tell them just how great it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this year something different is happening. To put it bluntly, no-one in the electorate believes him. This year the Prime Minister has been too smart for his own good. He has ridden out pressure for an earlier economic statement and he has produced a budget which he says will deliver a surplus but, after 13 years of hearing promise after promise that does not come true, people are sick of his boasting. They no longer trust this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the efforts of our super-salesman PM, the standing of the government has fallen in the polls since budget night. The 1995 budget has already been labelled as a smoke and mirrors exercise, and rightly so. When the artifice and the glitz are stripped away, government spending will actually increase by 1.7 per cent in real terms, and personal taxation is set to jump by a whopping 13.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A look at some of the budget's main points shows just what a phoney document it is. The government claims to have produced a surplus budget, but this notional surplus depends on asset sales. The government's record on achieving its asset sales has been abysmal. Since 1987-88, the government has estimated that privatisation would raise $11 billion. In that time it has received just $5.8 billion, or just over half. The long awaited proceeds of the Qantas sale are becoming a regular item in the budget papers. The government's asset sales have not even been motivated by a belief in efficiency. They are just a desperate grab for cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dasfleet sale is a prime example of how dodgy this process has become. The government plans to sell Dasfleet, to raise some cash now, but then pay it out again through a lease-back by leaving employees on the public payroll. It is a particularly crude exercise. Too much of this budget is a collection of accounting tricks. Too much of it will either increase prices, hit jobs, lead to interest rate rises, reduce take-home pay or break election promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in company tax will hit small firms and cause more job losses. We will all be paying more as companies of all sizes pass on their increased costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. By lifting the corporate tax rate to 36 per cent at a time when most nations are lowering their rates, the government is weakening our export position and making us less competitive. If this government gets its way, Australia's company tax rate will be one of the highest in the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Asia-Pacific region, only three countries now have higher company tax rates than Australia: Canada with 38 per cent; Japan with 37.5 per cent; and Korea with 36.5 per cent. Nations such as Thailand with 30 per cent, Singapore with 27 per cent and Hong Kong with a tiny 17.5 per cent have company tax rates well below ours. Our traditional benchmark, New Zealand, gets by with only 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By raising the company tax rate, the government is putting us out of step with international trends. It will be an impost which many companies, particularly small businesses, can ill afford. Yet, when challenged on this, all the Prime Minister can offer is some sneering advice and a warning that this is as good as it gets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jump in the sales tax on cars will add around $1,000 to the price of a new car. Motor dealers are already predicting a 25 per cent drop in sales. When this is combined with the drop of more than 25 per cent in demand for vehicles which occurred in April, the effects will be devastating. The new tax will hit ordinary people and be a real blow against the struggling motor vehicle industry, not to mention the small component manufacturers, both of which have significant operations in my home state of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in sales tax for building materials will add around $2,500 to the price of a $100,000 house, and will bump up the costs of renovations and even of basic home maintenance. Fortunately, the renovations on my own home will be finished by 1 July so I will not have to pay the extra tax! As the Taxation Institute of Australia has pointed out, the government's plans to treat independent subcontractors and the like as PAYE earners will result in higher costs for employers who will have to administer the onerous remittance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax rises are not the only budget slugs the Prime Minister has given us. The increase in the Medicare levy will be yet another burden. The compulsory superannuation contribution takes away people's right to make their own choice about investing in their future. It forces them into a particular form of investment that may not be the most appropriate, especially for people nearing retirement. Low income earners may suffer as their superannuation investments are swallowed up by fund administration costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also doubtful just how many people will actually enjoy the fruits of this scheme. Tax promises the Prime Minister made only two years ago have been junked. Promises for the next century look even less likely to ever occur. As the representative of an electorate with significant numbers of people of and near retirement age, I am concerned by the rip-off the cancellation of the tax cuts represents to these people. No person who is retired now, or retiring between this year and 1998, will receive any benefit from the government's superannuation proposals. At the same time, they will not enjoy the extra money the abandoned One Nation tax promises could have provided, money that could have been invested towards retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This group of people has been entirely ignored by the government. The parliamentary secretary says, `Speak to 70 per cent of the population.' I am just talking about the self-funded retirees and the fact that the government has ignored them yet again in this budget. They have lost their tax cuts and they have received no compensation through increased payments to superannuation. That is what I am talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will be opposing the increases in company tax, the hike in the Medicare levy, the new sales taxes on cars and building materials and the PAYE remittance arrangements. For all these reasons, when the government produces the legislation for these proposals, we will oppose them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats' sanctimony deserves a special mention. They have been happy to support this budget's changes, but they have sought an inquiry into its figuring. The budget is either dodgy or it is not. Calling for an inquiry into how the government reached the budget bottom line, while supporting its contents, is a particularly hypocritical grab for a platform for publicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To try to end this type of politicking, the coalition has committed itself to a charter of budget honesty that will clearly separate the recurrent and capital sides of the budget, establish benchmarks against which fiscal policies can be assessed, seek to achieve prudent public debt levels and then seek to achieve a more appropriate balance between operating revenue and operating expenditure and provide a degree of predictability about the level and stability of tax rates for future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To restore further credibility to the budget process, a coalition government would release a statement three months before the budget signalling its major goals and would encourage the Reserve Bank to further develop its information strategies, including regular statements on monetary policy and the release of economic forecasts. The need for decent budget making strategies has become all too clear. This budget is the culmination of three years of short-term, politically expedient policy making that does nothing to help the overall problems facing our nation. Ever since the One Nation budget package was handed down in 1992, glib politics has replaced good economics. One Nation promised $5 1/2 billion of new spending and $11.1 billion of tax cuts. Normally, Treasury would have prepared details of tax cuts, but now we know that it was told that these would be done by the Prime Minister's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not the only departure from normal practice. Economic forecasting was also hijacked by the Prime Minister and his advisers, who made up projections showing Australia growing at a rate that had never been sustained in the past, at a time when the economy had barely stopped shrinking. After just eight months in his new job, the Prime Minister had committed himself to $22 billion of tax and spending measures, but only offset it by $5 billion of new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After scraping in at the 1993 election, the government was in a bind over what to do with its promised tax cuts. The result was the preposterous 1993 budget, where John Dawkins was forced to raise taxes to pay for the Prime Minister's tax cuts. The government gave away $3,700 million in tax cuts, then took back all but a paltry $100 million, mainly through regressive taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, we have had battles between the Prime Minister and the deficit daleks. We have had fights between the Prime Minister and his Treasurer (Mr Willis) over a mini-budget, and fights between the government and Treasury and between the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank. Ever since One Nation, and particularly since the last election, short-term politics have replaced good economic management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has always preferred grand designs to the minutiae of day-to-day public management. He seems to have forgotten that his first great plan as Treasurer was to transform the economy and the image of the ALP as an economic manager. He is still seeking to transform Australia, using a lot of money which the nation simply does not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Prime Minister Keating' and `Treasurer Keating' are very different creatures. In a particularly ironic twist, he has undermined the reputation he helped gain for the ALP with his spending cuts in the 1980s. The last three years have seen a ballooning of public expenditure and program spending. Too much of this consists of new outlays. It has not been cyclical spending to cushion the country during a recession. There is still much to be done before the government can truly say that public spending has been pared back to the bone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget does nothing to tackle the current account deficit in the medium term. Micro-economic reform is completely ignored. Tariff cuts and the recession forced the private sector to review internal structures and slash middle management positions. There is no reason why the public sector cannot do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Business Council of Australia has called for an external commission of audit, to identify savings across all departments, and the coalition has said it will do so when in power. The BCA estimates that savings of $5 billion are possible. Basic running costs of government have risen by more than 33 per cent in real terms since 1987-88, and they now account for almost 10 per cent of budget outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a costly growth in the higher ranks of the bureaucracy. Numbers of people in the senior officer grades C, B and A, the equivalent to private sector middle management, have rocketed, from four per cent of staff in 1984 to nine per cent. The Department of Finance has already warned of the traffic jam this is creating in the Public Service career path. Not only is the public sector work force ageing; staff are racing up the ranks to senior officer level and then stopping abruptly, because of the limited opportunities to jump to the next level&mdash;the Senior Executive Service bands 1 to 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Philippa Smith, warned in a speech to the Public Service Commission that red tape, cost cutting and buck-passing meant that bureaucrats were failing in their duty to deliver an efficient service. According to Ms Smith, the need to reduce costs has been translated not into greater cost competitiveness or better services but into service rationing, and public servants themselves need a clearer view of where their fundamental duties lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my first speech in this place, I said I believed there was a place for government in promoting economic growth and the recovery of this country, in protecting the weak from the strong and in ensuring that all citizens are treated fairly and equitably. I went on to say that this does not imply that the state will always be right, or will always have the panacea for our country's ills. I said that a true liberal would expect government to limit itself, to encourage the freedom of its people and broaden the opportunity for choices to be made by each individual as freely as possible from government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My views have not changed on this matter. When we speak only of reducing the power of the state, we can forget what the qualitative role of the state should be. Politicians and senior bureaucrats are being forced today to ask, `What is the core business of government? What services can be cut, replaced or run better to improve our competitive position?' Managerialism has overruled the competing claims of ideology to become the dominant language of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are moving from the traditional black and white that has characterised government and bureaucracy. In almost every sphere other than politics new forms have replaced top-heavy, strong power models of management. We need to take the public services we have inherited from the industrial era, organised in a top-down fashion to deliver standards to mass markets, and restructure them to meet the needs of the information age in an entrepreneurial way. The greatest leverage for governments in a global economy is in their investment in people and public infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian National Audit Office performance studies have already found basic ongoing savings of $80 million a year in improved administration of cash, banking and borrowing by departments, $46 million in energy costs and improved planning and $10 million from better management of government credit cards. The demands of accountability can place cumbersome rules on the public sector, but this does not mean its operations and processes cannot be streamlined, as shown by those examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Micro-economic reform has largely stalled since the early 1990s. The much vaunted Hilmer competition reforms will themselves be implemented largely by the states. In government, much of the work of the 1980s has been lost. Government's jobs are to keep foreign debt down, control inflation and manage the current account deficit, amongst other things. However, we have to avoid a preoccupation with savings alone that ignores the equally important field of improvements in the performance and range of services offered by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government will have new roles as it seeks to maintain our competitive advantage. In this environment many of the big government-small government ideas that have characterised our thinking for so long become simplistic. Australia's quality of life is one of our central selling points. Governments play a significant role in providing parts of this, like education, health services, arts and cultural facilities, practical environmental protection and justice and human rights. Quality of life is as significant a part of a nation's overall competitive advantage as are cost considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are examples to give. Governments will need to manage the massive investment in education needed to meet the demands of a knowledge based age, not necessarily as the sole providers but as the coordinator of programs that will maximise our national skills. We also need to ensure that we have an adequate national infrastructure, but again through the planning and coordination of facilities in a way that maximises our position, not by their financing and provision. Savings are already being made from commercialising services, but we should not ignore the export potential of the expertise we have developed in our public sector, like in Telecom, and market this with help from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1970s and 1980s it was thought that stripping back the state to its fundamentals and relying on markets would provide a solution to economic woes. Today we need to reinvent government on a scale hardly imagined before. We must avoid the trap of seeking nothing but savings from government. Better financial outcomes that fail to deliver any other benefits will not equip us to face the future. The real goal of government in the 1990s is to deliver performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget does nothing to help this. It only offers smoke and mirrors and magic tricks. Clever exercises with figures may be a satisfying game for the Prime Minister, but accounting fiddles and gimmicks do not provide good public policy, and this budget and government will not provide what Australia needs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to speak this afternoon in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1). I wish to express my concern about what I believe to be one of the most unfair and shonkiest budgets in living memory. The figures are so rubbery that the budget is still bouncing out there. Quite clearly, this budget, as were many of the government's previous budgets, has been predicated on shonky figures. It just goes to show what can be done with a bit of creative accountancy when you put into computers figures which you quite clearly know are not achievable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is unfair, because it really targets the sections of the community least able to afford the government's massive tax take in so many areas of everyday life. It is shonky, because it breaks a whole swag of promises made by the government in the 1993 election campaign, and it is financed by selling off Australia's national family silver, including the Commonwealth Bank. I suppose it comes as a surprise even to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, and to members on the other side of the House, to see that great icon of the Labor Party being completely sold off. I guess even the true believers out there no longer believe in the Labor Party. I guess there are many battlers out there in Australia who have lost faith in this government and this Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus on the impact of the budget on families, businesses and rural and remote Australia which are already reeling from the drought, high interest rates and that recession that this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that this nation had to have. It is interesting to read through the budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), because the words `rural community' were not mentioned once. Of course, the forgotten people of remote Australia hardly rate a mention from any member on the other side of the House, on any occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister believes that small business has never had it so good. I wish I could pass on to the House the reaction of the small businesses in my community to those sorts of comments from the Prime Minister. But I will not, because it would be quite unparliamentary to record those statements in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1995-96 budget, few areas of daily living will be untouched by the Prime Minister's tax take. The list of increased taxes really makes grim reading. For example, motor vehicle sales taxes will rise by five percentage points. That is going to add $1,000 to the price of the average family car. It is also going to impact on businesses&mdash;and, particularly, on commercial travellers&mdash;because they are going to be paying for those increases, especially where they use vehicles as part of their business operations. So it hits not only the family but the small business community as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home building and renovations will be hit by a new 12 per cent tax on hardware and building materials. That is going to add $2,500 to the cost of the average family home. All that really does is put the great Australian dream further from the reach of average Australians&mdash;the battlers out there who would love to own their own homes or to add another room to the great dreams they have. What we are seeing is the Prime Minister and the government chasing more tax from the battlers of this nation through a savage 12 per cent new tax on the building materials that are used to build the family home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, these taxes also impact on the business community and, in particular, the small business community. Small business owners are great investors in their own futures and in their own businesses, and the government's taxes are going to hit items that they use to build their sheds, their offices and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Medicare levy has been increased yet again. All that will serve to do is drive more people even further away from taking up private health insurance. The general public out there may well remember that when Medicare was first introduced it was a one per cent levy. Today, it is 1.4 per cent and it is going to rise to 1.5 per cent. That sounds like a small increase, but in terms of the people out there who have to pay this Medicare levy all it will tend to do will be to drive more and more people out of private health insurance. That is the opposite of what we should be trying to achieve in medical care in this country. We should be encouraging more people into private health insurance, not driving them away with this savage increase in the Medicare levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $185 million of revenue for licensing and supervision fees on banks will no doubt be passed on to their consumers in the form of higher bank charges. No-one will convince me&mdash;least of all the Prime Minister, who has not convinced anyone yet&mdash;that that new fee will not be passed on to the consumers of this nation. Only a week or so ago, when he addressed the National Farmers Federation, the Prime Minister aimed a little bit of a broadside at the banks of this nation. If he were genuine in his comments relating to the banking industry, he would do something about it. But all we have heard in that area from the Prime Minister are soft words of rhetoric, that he understands the problem and that the banks have a responsibility. When the Prime Minister is introducing a new tax which is going to rip another $185 million out of the banking sector, which will be passed on to the consumers, how does that rest with his statements to the National Farmers Federation last week? Quite clearly the Prime Minister's rhetoric is not matched by the actions of his government, and indeed in this case the federal budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is set in this budget to extract greater dividends from Australia Post and Telecom, which will inevitably lead to hikes in the cost of postage stamps and telephone calls. Instead of Telecom paying higher dividends to the federal government, it would be great to see that money being invested in infrastructure, particularly out there in rural and remote Australia. Many people in rural and remote Australia rely on what is called a digital radiocommunication system. It certainly has brought an automatic telephone service to many rural and remote communities, but one of the problems with the DRCS system is the speed of transmission of that technology. It is preventing many people, particularly small businesses and the farming community, from accessing fast transmission speeds. As computer technology improves, and as the Internet and the rest of the information superhighway become more widely available, many of these people will find that their access to those technologies will in fact be too slow. It would have been better to have seen this money going back out into infrastructure rather than to a higher dividend to the federal government. Quite clearly Telecom, as the universal service provider of communications across this nation, will be forced to withdraw some of the programs that it had planned for rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of postage costs, mail services in remote Australia already are sparse&mdash;in many cases only once a fortnight. The additional dividend could have been used to ensure that people, particularly those students in rural and remote Australia who need to use distance education services, were at least able to receive the mail on a more regular basis than they receive it today. But the federal government has said, `We want more dividends from Australia Post.' That puts additional pressure on Australia Post to meet its budgetary requirements, which will place further pressure on the services that it provides out there in rural and remote Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we all know that those One Nation l-a-w tax cuts were junked long ago and that the Prime Minister is trying to tell us that they will now be paid in the form of superannuation, somewhere in the distant future. No-one believes that the Prime Minister's commitment in that area will be met either. Quite clearly the people took him at his word prior to the last federal election that these tax cuts were l-a-w, which proved to be l-i-e-s. They do not believe in this case that he is going to meet his commitment and turn these tax cuts into superannuation commitments in 1997-98 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of all these tax increases in this federal budget, families struggling to meet daily living expenses will now have to reach even further into their pockets to pay for the failures of the policies of the Prime Minister and the extravagance of his government. In addition, many rural Australians are going to be hit by the increase in avgas duty, which will increase the cost of aerial spraying, for example, by more than 10 per cent in some cases. Avgas is a fuel that is used in piston driven engines and, of course, many of the aeroplanes using avgas to operate in rural Australia are used for mustering and for checking properties; so, quite clearly, this is just another increase in the operating costs for many of our rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The abolition of the diesel fuel excise rebate for residential premises is going to hit low income people. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure there are people in your own electorate of Hunter who use fuel oil for heating their homes, or for cooking. Quite clearly, the people who have these oil heating and cooking facilities in their homes are people in lower socioeconomic circumstances. The abolition of the diesel fuel excise rebate for residential premises is going to hit low income people, who have little opportunity to convert to other sources of energy such as electricity, gas, or solar power. The $13 million savings to the government is, in fact, a tax that will be borne by the lower socioeconomic group in this nation: in other words, by the battlers and the battling families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as these tax hikes, the people of rural Australia have been hard hit by the expenditure side of the budget, which has confirmed, once and for all, the government's urban bias. For instance, the skewing of the federal funding to Australia's cities is so blatant that, unlike other areas of expenditure, there has been no attempt to conceal it by using tricky budgetary accounting. While the government has allocated an additional $247 million to the better cities program over the next six years, rural Australians have been promised a paltry increase of $5 million over three years in the regional development program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add insult to injury, the government has promised to consider even more funding for better cities, but is conspicuously silent on its plans for regional development. There is nothing at all for Australians in rural and remote areas. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the government's urban bias is actually exacerbating the problems that the better cities program is supposed to be fixing. The government is starving Australia's rural and remote regions of funding, and is denying them the growth opportunities which could make them more attractive places in which to live and invest, thereby relieving some of the pressures on our congested urban fringes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a couple of weeks ago, the new Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, made the statement that Sydney is now becoming overcrowded. He is suggesting that there should not be any more population growth in Sydney, but that we should be ensuring that the population growth in the future should take place in the provincial cities and rural Australia. Quite clearly, the $247 million that the federal government has announced in this budget under the better cities program might address some of the problems that the cities are having, but there is only $5 million for regional development. Even the Labor Premier of New South Wales would agree that this budget is skewed towards urban society and that it is not balanced, in an equity sense, towards supplying some support for regional, rural and remote Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal funding for rural local councils is now lower in real terms than when Labor came to office in 1983. While the government has abolished funding for major rural arterial roads the new better cities program will provide more funding for transport facilities in our cities. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) is very sensitive about my criticisms of the government's policies for rural Australia, and I will continue to be critical of the government's policies in that area. His only response has been to list the projects funded by the better cities program. This is wonderful for the 27 centres which received better cities funding but it is of no use to the heartland of rural Australia, which totally misses out on any funding in terms of a targeted initiative in the way that the better cities program benefits our capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the cruellest expenditure cuts in this budget was the axing of a hostel for rural students program, which has been vital to the provision of education to students in rural and remote Australia. The program was axed in this budget despite a commitment from the government that it would be funded throughout 1995-96. This betrayal by the government will result in a further hardship for the operators of rural hostels and for the parents in rural and remote areas who are already struggling to ensure their children receive an adequate education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is the surest sign yet that the government has lost its way. It is also evidence of the government's arrogance and insensitivity to Australia's disadvantaged rural and remote regions. As many of the commentators said on the night of the budget, `If you can believe the Prime Minister, you can believe the budget.' Quite clearly, people do not believe the Prime Minister and they do not believe that this budget will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having spoken on education matters a moment ago I would like to bring another element of the government's education budget to the attention of the House. I have made a number of representations to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) in respect of applications by St Patrick's school in Emerald for a three-stream high school. That school is in my own electorate of Maranoa. The original application for funding was rejected but this decision was reversed by the minister yesterday on the advice of the Non-government Schools Funding Committee. I congratulate the minister on the decision which will be of immeasurable long-term benefit to the people of Emerald and surrounding districts. Hopefully, Dalby and Stanthorpe schools will also receive funding under that same program, as their applications are under review at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned, however, that the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) was apparently advised by the minister's office within a matter of minutes of that decision having been made; a decision, I might add, for which I was grateful. However, the member for Capricornia wasted no time in issuing a press release announcing the grant. As most honourable members will be aware, Emerald is not in the electorate of Capricornia; it is in the electorate of Maranoa. I, as the elected member for Maranoa, have yet to receive official advice of the minister's decision. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This was a particularly difficult budget to prepare because it comes just before an election but also required a very delicate economic balance. It involved finding a way of maximising growth of employment whilst keeping inflation low, aiming to reduce the budget deficit and to keep interest rates down whilst trying to reduce the current account deficit, and getting a proper balance between revenue and outlays. It seems to me that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) achieved that balance very effectively. I would like to go through in some detail the measures that he has adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, there are the criteria which had to be used in preparing the budget. Obviously, the most important criterion was that the budget had to prepare the ground for further improvements in employment. Unemployment is clearly Australia's major economic and social problem. A large number of people, approximately 800,000, are still unemployed. That is causing enormous personal damage to those people and those who are dependent on them. It is also the cause of great economic damage to the whole country, because of the economic loss, the waste that is caused by those people being unable to find the work that they want, and also because of the discouragement to other people to rejoin the work force or join the work force for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth of employment had to be the highest priority. But a second major priority had to be reduction of the current account deficit. Australia has through most of its history had a current account deficit and that is natural in a rapidly developing country. That is something we often forget. It is quite proper for a rapidly developing country, which is building up its infrastructure, to import capital. A current account deficit is the other side of that equation. But it is important to keep that current account deficit down to a manageable size, and it is at the absolute upper edge of that at present. So reduction of the current account deficit was a very important element of the goals for which the budget had to be prepared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, it was important to try to maintain a low level of inflation; it was important to reassure financial markets that the government was committed to maintaining inflation at a lower rate. We have had two or three years now of remarkably low inflation, right at the lower end of that of the trading partners to which we compare ourselves. But it is important to maintain that low level of inflation, both because it improves our trading capacity, and also because it increases people's sense of personal security. If prices are not rising significantly, or rising only very slowly, the sense of personal economic security is enhanced. Also, if inflation is growing rapidly, there tend to be distributional consequences which are damaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was important too to try to reduce the budget deficit. It is appropriate to have budget deficits at times when the economy is in recession, but it is important at a time when the economy is growing strongly to reduce or eliminate that budget deficit, if that is possible. That is the appropriate countercyclical activity for governments. When economies are booming, governments can go slower; when economies are in recession, the government should push the economy along. The economy is growing strongly at present; therefore the need for fiscal stimulus from the public sector is much reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to reduce the budget deficit so as to minimise the extent of public sector borrowing and therefore the extent of debt service that is required, because the larger the debt, the larger the interest payment the government has to make, and the fewer funds are available for all the other vital activities in which government is involved. It was also important to reduce the budget deficit, again to reassure the financial markets that the government intended to create conditions where interest rates could be kept as low as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it was important to stimulate growth of national savings. That is important, both because of the benefit of that to the current account and to interest rates, but also so that we have the resources available to build up both public and private investment, so as to facilitate more rapid and more wide ranging economic development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has, like every other country, depended on its investment for its economic development. Savings are the basis for that. There are very strong reasons for giving savings particular attention in this budget, because the saving ratio has been far too low for some years. There are no doubt many causes for that, but the public sector is able to make a contribution to building up savings by minimising its own borrowing requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those were the goals which were required for the formation of a responsible budget. The government was also aware that an election is likely to be less than a year away and, therefore, it did not want to antagonise the electorate unnecessarily. So there were pretty tight economic and political criteria which had to be met in the preparation of the budget. I think the Treasurer has achieved that balance remarkably well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look first at the outlays side of the budget. I will then come to the revenue, and then discuss some of the outcomes. The most significant outlay and revenue decision was that relating to superannuation and the taxation cuts which were due in 1998. It seems to me that that foreshadowed revenue reduction in 1998 would have been entirely irresponsible. One of the requirements of effective fiscal policy is that there should be an adequate revenue base to provide for recurrent outlays without borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to have an adequate defence system, education system, health system and community services of all kinds, and if it is going to care for the environment, support people when they are old, support children when they need child care, support the aged and so on&mdash;the massive number of tasks that the public sector undertakes&mdash;then there has to be an adequate revenue base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is now one of the lowest taxed, well-off, industrialised countries. The level of revenue collected here is right at the bottom end of that of comparable countries which are members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development&mdash;the OECD. In fact, amongst the OECD members, only Mexico and Turkey collect less of their national income in tax than does Australia. In that situation, and in a situation where there is clearly a great need for expansion of public services in many areas, it really would have been irresponsible to go ahead with a further reduction in taxation in three years time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has very effectively found a way of ensuring that the benefit that would have accrued to people in 1998 has been made available, but in a much more economically responsible way. It has done so by withdrawing the tax cut and replacing it with an increase in support for superannuation. This means that lower and middle income people who are already contributing to their own retirement income through their employers' contribution to superannuation will now also receive a contribution from government to their accumulating savings for retirement. That will increase their income when they retire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That measure will also increase the total national savings by building up the amount of the total national income which is collected as superannuation ready for people's retirement. That is macro-economically responsible because it builds up the total level of savings, but it is also an equitable change because the tax cuts would have gone principally to middle and upper income earners, while the support for superannuation goes to lower and middle income earners. So we have a desirable macro-economic shift which is also an equitable shift. The budget has made a very valuable, vital contribution in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of money involved&mdash;$4 1/2 billion in the first full year in which both changes would have operated&mdash;really is a very large amount of money and a very important decision has been made which lays a much sounder framework for continuing economic and social development in Australia. So I wholeheartedly welcome that change and congratulate the Treasurer and the other members of the cabinet who decided on that proposal for their imagination and their responsibility in deciding on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, there is a whole series of other much smaller, but nevertheless very important, improvements in outlays which are of great benefit to the wider community. The most obvious is the introduction of a maternity allowance&mdash;an allowance that will be paid to every mother at the time of the birth of a child&mdash;to support those mothers at that time when their outlays are increased because of the addition of a family member. That is something that is very important in a comprehensive social security system. In a way it is surprising that it has not existed before. But at least it has now been introduced and, again, one can wholeheartedly congratulate the government for its sense of social responsibility in providing that support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a whole series of other smaller changes, many of which I would like to warmly welcome as well, and some of which are ones that I have actively campaigned for, so I am very glad to see them. Just going down the list as they appear in the budget, not necessarily in order of size or even of priority, I come first to the reference to the increased funding for research&mdash;research infrastructure. The effectiveness of economic development in any country depends to a very substantial extent on the originality and the initiative of its scientific researchers. Yet there is no doubt that many of our scientific organisations&mdash;CSIRO, universities, and others&mdash;have been finding difficulty in obtaining the equipment and facilities they need to expand their research programs as effectively as possible. So some additional funding for research infrastructure, to update that infrastructure, to ensure that it is fully accurate and the most modern available in the world, is crucial to the quality of that scientific research and is to be warmly welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, also in the research area, there is additional funding for medical research. A number of my constituents have been at me for years to try to get the government to increase funding for medical research. Australia has a particularly fine record internationally for the quality of our medical research. This increase is to be warmly welcomed and I would be astonished if anyone in the House did not agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other changes that are very important include the increase in funding for vocational education. I would have liked that to be at a much higher level because, at the beginning of last year, 140,000 applicants for technical and further education could not get places. That is a national tragedy, because we want as skilled a work force as possible, we want everybody to have the opportunities that they need, and an increase in the number of places in TAFE colleges is vital. But at least a step was taken in the budget&mdash;in a tightly constrained budget&mdash;to increase funding for TAFEs so that more people can obtain places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other very important initiatives are additional funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health programs, housing programs, and an increase in the guardian allowance, which is very important for people who are caring for others at home. There is some increase in funding for the Australian Film Finance Corporation and for a commercial television production. They may seem a bit more wide ranging, but I think we would all welcome support for Australian creativity in the arts and in film, both for cinemas and for television, which are vital parts of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a program of increased outlays in the environment area. One part of that which I am particularly glad to see is the support for the biodiversity program. In Australia, a substantial number of our ecosystems are still not represented at all, or quite inadequately, in the protected area system. That means that the system of national parks and nature reserves needs to be expanded to ensure that all major Australian ecosystems are represented so that they can be preserved for all time. The only way of ensuring that is to have them in protected areas. This increase in funding for the biodiversity program will enable more of those systems to be included in the national protected area systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there were some very important initiatives. By the way, another initiative on the environment was announced on Sunday, and that was support for coastal protection. Anyone who loves the surf, the sea and the sand will welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such outlay programs have to be paid for. A couple of ways they can be paid for are by cuts in other outlays or by increases in revenue. One minor rescheduling of an outlay has made way for some of those improvements. That is the rescheduling of some major defence investments. That, of course, is entirely appropriate at a time when Australia is threatened by no-one and we already have a very large defence expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area which could have been reduced but has not been is that of the security services. Our security services have not been significantly reduced since the end of the Cold War. Yet they were established as agents for dealing with potential enemies during the Cold War, and it would be entirely appropriate to reconsider their role following the end of the Cold War, and to substantially reduce their outlays. In fact, their outlays have increased by about 300 per cent over the last 15 years, and that is very much more than they need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the main way in which the increases in outlays and the reduction in the deficit were funded in this budget was through some minor, but important, changes to revenue. Apart from the withdrawal of the proposed tax cut in 1998, the major ones were all equitable and entirely appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest one was the small increase in the company tax rate, from 33 to 36 per cent. At 36 per cent, it is still lower than in most comparable countries. That is the kind of countercyclical change which is appropriate at a time when the economy is growing strongly. It was important to reduce the deficit. It was important to have these small increases in outlays. Having some increase in the company tax rate was a very appropriate way to fund part of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another step is an improvement in compliance activity on the part of the Australian Taxation Office. Everyone in Australia will welcome attempts to ensure that tax minimisation, or tax avoidance, is stamped on. It is estimated that that increased and enhanced activity by the Australian Taxation Office will generate about $150 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were several other changes, all of which were important. One which I particularly welcome is the small increase in the bank licence and supervision fee. All of those changes were very welcome. The outcome of the budget will be a reduction in unemployment, a stable inflation rate, greater equity and a smaller current account deficit. Those were the goals for which we were looking. I wholeheartedly congratulate the Treasurer and the cabinet on their success in carefully balancing revenue and outlays. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) to speak about a specific matter within the province of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), and that is the telecommunications installations that are being put up around Australia, in every member's district, to support the extension of the mobile phone network. This has caused a great deal of concern among members of the public who have been affected by these installations. This has been expressed by several members of parliament in recent months this year. I refer to a release put out by Senator Bob Woods on 10 February 1995. I will quote several extracts from that release:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"But it is the companies themselves which have done everything possible to take advantage of the Government's irresponsibility by building base-stations and towers virtually wherever they like.</PARA>
<PARA>On 31 May 1994 Senator Reid gave notice of this motion in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) condemns the Federal Government for breaching the integrity of the National Capital Plan by giving unique authority to telecommunications carriers Telecom, Vodafone and Optus to erect towers on Canberra's hilltops for use by their mobile phone networks;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)deplores the fact that no consultation took place with the ACT Government . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is a question on notice from the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) which lists nine matters concerning the installation of mobile telephone base stations in Australia. This is just a scan of interest shown by members of the Senate and this place about the installation of this equipment. The carriers are governed by the telecommunications national code. The first objective of that code is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)to facilitate the provision of efficient, modern and cost effective telecommunications service to the public . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number of other objectives. The last objective is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e)to require carriers to be accountable to Government bodies and the public for their activities.</PARA>
<PARA>Who is kidding whom here about the carriers being accountable to government bodies and the public for their activities when, in fact, they operate under exempt status? It is interesting to read the Telecommunications Act which allows the companies to so operate. Section 116(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations may provide that specified carriers may engage in specified exempt activities despite specified laws of a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>Regulation 5 of the Telecommunications (Exempt Activities) Regulations, which were brought in on 20 November 1991, lists in some detail the exempt activities in which the carriers can involve themselves. The first category of exempt activities includes the construction of structures, trenches, facilities, manholes, public payphones, structures whose principal purpose will be to contain equipment and so on. Secondly, they include the maintenance, repair, refurbishment, alteration or demolition by a carrier. The third category of exempt activities states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the installation, certification, operation, maintenance, repair or removal by a carrier of any of the following that forms part of a carrier's public telecommunications network.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to list a whole range of activities. Regulation 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of subsection 116(1) of the Act, a carrier may engage in the exempt activities set out in regulation 5 despite a law of a State or Territory . . .</PARA>
<PARA>How on earth can the code itself claim that one of the objectives is `to require carriers to be accountable to government bodies and the public for their activities'? There is an absolute contradiction in the expression in the code that they shall be so bound, when the act and the regulations under that act extend to the companies a completely exempt status in those very activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the code goes into great detail on how a plan must be prepared and made available to the public, the plan is to be made available without anyone's protest about that plan being able to have any effect. The only authority over the plans of the carriers of the telecommunications equipment is held by the Secretary to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one reads the code in its completest form, one finds that lots of plans must be made by the carriers. They must be presented to the council and made available to the forms of local and territory government and to the public for inspection at a reasonable cost. But anyone who wants to protest can go, ultimately, only to the Secretary to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. There is no local authority. The council can say it does not want it as much as it likes. The state government departments can only give advice; they have no authority to challenge. The challenge can only go through to the secretary to the department. This claim that the public shall be taken note of and that the public must be able to inspect the plans falls to pieces when no-one other than the secretary to the department has any power to affect it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the minister say when he brought in this new code last year? A press release put out by the minister on 30 June last year states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Telecommunications National Code for Australia will require the carriers to consult more with local councils, relevant authorities and the Australian Heritage Commission on the location of mobile telephone towers, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Michael Lee, said yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The carriers will now be subject to environmental requirements far more stringent than was previously the case.</PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when a carrier and a local council were unable to resolve questions on the environmental impact of a proposed mobile facility site, the issue must be referred to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the only avenue provided in the whole code for any local person, council or state government to protest effectively. It is the secretary to the department who will have the final say; no-one else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has neglected the instructions he has under the Telecommunications Act. Whilst he has produced the telecommunications national code, subsection 127A(1) of the Telecommunications Act quite definitely states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister must by writing determine a Land Access Code&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is in addition to the telecommunications national code already in existence&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>It goes on further. But the overriding fact is that the act says not that the minister `may determine a land access code', but that the minister `must by writing determine a land access code that does one or more of the following'. My constituents, in framing their complaints against the installation and possible installation of these facilities, have found that no code exists. The department itself will tell you that no code exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Communications and the Arts has failed to observe the act which governs the operation of his department. That is a very important aspect and it shows how little the minister and the government care about those people out in the community who are affected by a possible loss of value of their property, by a loss of amenity and by environmental pressure on them by the installation of these facilities under the exempt regulations. The minister has neglected that code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, the community is disenfranchised. No normal procedures are available to it to protest. The state government is muted and local government is a joke in relation to this code. As I said, only the secretary to the department of environment can have a final say on the discussions and disagreements on these installations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other major factor is that Austel, as the overseeing body of telecommunications in Australia, has the power, as set out in subsection 38(2) of the Telecommunications Act. The subsection states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions of AUSTEL include protecting consumers from unfair practices of carriers and other persons in the supply of telecommunications services, the supply, installation or maintenance of customer equipment or the performance of cabling work and, for that purpose . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Then it details a number of important subheadings. Two factors are the immediate supervision in dealing with protests under the code by the secretary to the department and, in the wider sense, seeing that carriers are fair to consumers. In other instances Austel has an overriding authority. None of this, as I have said, resides with the local people affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of carriers has multiplied. We no longer have just Telecom. We have Vodafone and Optus. We have companies with a profit motive, which I do not in any way criticise. So they have a profit motive. I hate to think what slack efficiency they would be operating with if they did not have to produce a profit. They are there for profit. However, they operate with an exempt status. They can operate to the detriment of individual citizens or a collective group of citizens and do so exempt from the normal laws of the land, which is something very few others in this community can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand there will be further deregulation in 1997. Further companies will be involved. Will they, too, have an exempt status? I ask members of the House whether these companies will be able to go along to someone and say, `I'm going to put this in your backyard. You can't stop me.' They would have to pay compensation, of course. There are further provisions in the code that require compensation if people are hurt, but no compensation is available for environmental damage or for placing a facility next door to someone's property that may depress the value of that property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention the instance which has brought my concern to a head. It concerns the installation of a facility on top of the old Vogue Theatre at 25 Belair Road, Kingswood, which is in my district. This has been a disaster from start to finish. Optus is the installing company. Optus approached the council with its detailed plan, and the council approached one resident, who happened to live next to the theatre. It did not approach those in the district who could see this installation from the distance. The council failed absolutely in its duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the code does not say the council has to notify citizens, it did not do its duty. The citizen who was approached had a death in the family a few days beforehand and did not take any notice of the notification. So the one resident the council did send a notification to ignored it, for logical reasons. In a letter to Optus dated 8 March this year, the council stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Council, at its meeting of 3 January, resolved to advise Optus that it has no comment to make regarding the proposal . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, after all the protests came to a head, the council wrote back on 11 April to say the facility should be removed. This is the mess the council has got this scheme into. But of course it was not just the council that failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Optus's plan as presented to the council was defective. The plan that was put to the council giving a perspective of the installation on top of the theatre included a scale which was faulty. In later protests about the size of the installation, the council measured the expected height on the plan with the scale provided and got 2.55 metres. The actual height of the installation is 3.9 metres. The plan, however&mdash;if you examine it without the scale&mdash;was correct with regard to the height and gave it as 3.6 metres. But no-one examining the plan would bypass the scale; you would use the scale. Those who used the scale got a wholly defective measurement. The width of the installation that has been put up is very much wider than the one that is on the plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Optus and I have had a talk about this. It says that its plan, when examined, was truly drawn to scale&mdash;if you ignore the faulty scale provided with the plan&mdash;and does show an installation of 3.6 metres high. Optus says that the one installed is only 3.9 metres and the extension beyond the plan is not of great significance. But if you go by the scale, of course, it is very much greater than the scale produced. The width of the installation is the subject of further discussion and is much greater than the plan that was put in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plan that was given to the building owner was quite defective. It was drawn by a well-known firm of engineers and managers in Adelaide. The actual installation is 34 per cent higher than on the plan submitted to the building owner. The Optus measurement of the width is 4.4 metres; the council measures it as 6.36 metres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a disaster in all its forms. It is a disaster for the council because of its failure to notify ratepayers; it is a disaster from the company's point of view because its original plan to council had a faulty scale. The plan given to the building owner was simply drawn wrongly. We have local protests and local people who are now furious because they believe that they have been tricked. This is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the code is to be overhauled. There must be dramatic changes in the code. There is no way that the community and this parliament can tolerate the continuation of an exempt status for the three companies&mdash;or those companies that will join them after further deregulation&mdash;when they are putting their installations in for their final profit line. There is nothing wrong with that. I am not criticising the profit motive behind those companies, but I am saying that they cannot put with it the right to override nearly every normal planning authority and state authority in this community. It cannot happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred this mess to Austel. I have respectfully asked Austel to confirm or deny the measurements involved. If it is judged that the plan has not presented a proper picture to the community it affects, Optus should reduce the size of the installation accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The instance I referred to Austel is simply a peg on which to hang the greater question: what are we going to do with the overwhelming power that these companies now have, and how are we going to rein it in and give back to the local community the control of its environment, its district and the amenities which are peculiar to it? If we do not do that, we will be setting an enormous precedent as companies in search of profit could ignore all the normal safeguards that the community has developed over a very long period of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me pleasure to participate in this appropriations debate this afternoon for a number of reasons. One is to applaud yet another good Labor budget, and it is good for a range of reasons. Whilst I have a great interest in the macro impact of the budget across the country, I have&mdash;as honourable members would be aware&mdash;a particular interest in the effects the Commonwealth budget will have on the Northern Territory. This is because of my representational responsibilities to the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first observation one would make is that, yet again, the federal Labor government has ensured the maintenance of a strong underlying trend in growth for the Northern Territory economy, based principally on federal government outlays. This is a matter which is acknowledged within the Northern Territory's own budget papers, and I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What needs to be pointed out is that, through this recent budget, the federal government will provide $1.13 billion directly to the Northern Territory government's own revenue. In terms of the Northern Territory government's budget papers, that is around 75 per cent of the revenue on an economic transaction basis. The average Commonwealth contribution to the state and territory economies is 55 per cent. So the Commonwealth is appropriating 20 per cent more money to the Northern Territory than it is to the other states and territories, and that is for a very good reason. It is primarily as a result of the recognition within the budget process&mdash;and as a result of Grants Commission processes&mdash;of the cost of delivering services to remote Australia and to a community which is sparsely populated and has a high level of need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the Northern Territory government's budget papers point out the very positive outcomes from this year's Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings. First we saw advances in the Northern Territory's real per capita indexation of the financial assistance grants pool, which is responsible for about $38 million of the increase in the Northern Territory's financial assistance grants; and, secondly, the adoption of the updated per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, with the higher relativity for the territory resulting in an $8 million increase in the grants share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use those figures to underline the importance to the Northern Territory of the federal government's outlays, and this budget in particular. We have seen an increase of around 3.6 per cent in net Commonwealth payments to the Northern Territory for the year 1995-96. That is something which I think is acknowledged implicitly in the Northern Territory government's own budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not acknowledged in the Northern Territory's budget papers is the additional resources that were appropriated out of the Commonwealth budget and into the Northern Territory through the various portfolio arrangements. I want to emphasise this point: we have seen an absolute commitment by this federal Labor government year in year out to providing the basis for the Northern Territory's economy. That is becoming very obvious, and I will demonstrate that very clearly when I talk about the Northern Territory government's own budget. This year, on top of the $1.13 billion worth of grants to the Northern Territory government, the Northern Territory is getting a huge commitment of defence capital works worth in excess of half a billion dollars&mdash;$561 million to be exact&mdash;starting with $92.5 million in the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt at all that this program guarantees a very solid base. In fact, it underpins the construction industry in the Northern Territory&mdash;certainly in the Top End. It will maintain this solid base for the next five years. It is no accident that in the urban areas of the Northern Territory&mdash;particularly in Darwin and Katherine, where the Defence Force presence is the most obvious&mdash;the unemployment rate is the lowest we have seen. In those areas it is about four per cent. But we know that there are significant skill shortages in the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we are very pleased to have this capital injection into the Northern Territory economy, what we never hear from the CLP government in the Northern Territory is an absolute acknowledgment of the benefits that are derived by the Northern Territory economy generally from these expenditures. However, I noticed in this year's budget papers that there was some slight acknowledgment of the importance of the capital works expenditure, and that is welcome. It is interesting that around election time we do not hear the CLP ministers in the Northern Territory coming out and acknowledging or supporting the role that the Labor government has played in underpinning the Northern Territory government's economy, in ensuring that there is growth and in ensuring that we have a vital construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there has been a massive national injection of Defence Force moneys, in this last budget we saw an additional allocation of $15.6 million for roads in the Northern Territory over the next three years primarily to address the concerns of Aboriginal communities which have not been properly addressed by the Northern Territory government budget, which is responsible for supplying resources for these roads. This additional allocation came about as a result of my colleagues the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and Senator Bob Collins and me. That is just another small area of capital outlays. Also, the growth of the Northern Territory University is totally due to contributions from the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there has been a dramatic increase&mdash;we have seen increases in outlays for Aboriginal health and Aboriginal infrastructure resulting from this budget&mdash;we have not seen a similar effort being made in the Northern Territory. Whilst we have seen this growth in capital outlays from the Commonwealth government for its own purposes or through the Northern Territory government's own budget, the Northern Territory has just brought down a budget which has been described by some commentators as providing the steepest tax increase by any state, territory or Commonwealth government for at least the last 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as increasing taxes markedly, the Northern Territory government as recently as a couple of weeks ago when it brought down its budget imposed a maximum increase in housing commission rentals of $1,140 for particular types of housing. That will be a dramatic impost on people in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory government has increased bus fares and water and sewerage charges. There is also a fire levy of $180 per house. It is increasing tobacco tax, wine tax, car purchase duty, petroleum tax and car registration. Those taxes alone add $493 to a family's account. One assessment is that, if people in the Northern Territory who will be hit with the maximum increase in housing commission rentals took their fair share of the other taxes which are being applied or increased, the Northern Territory government would be getting another $1,783 from their pocket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might think that this is a government that thinks about social justice, but the people it is hitting hardest by these revenue raising measures are the poorest people in the community. There has been a dramatic injection of capital funds into the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth government. Is it not remarkable that in the recent Northern Territory budget it has decreased its own expenditure on capital works by around 20 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the Northern Territory community will come to an adequate conclusion about what this means for them. It emphasises for us the relative importance of the Commonwealth government's budget and outlays to the Northern Territory economy. As we are increasing our capital expenditure it is decreasing its. The Commonwealth government outlays will have a tremendous impact on the Northern Territory community. </PARA>

So let us not have any bulldust from you that you are part of this process, because you are not. If it were not for the initiatives of the federal Labor government, the Northern Territory economy would be an absolute basket case. That is acknowledged by all but those members of the CLP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague opposite should ask his National Party colleague in the Senate who masquerades as a CLP representative from the Northern Territory whether or not he thinks that the federal government's budget outlays underpin the Northern Territory's economy and ensures that the Northern Territory has low unemployment and a growing university. What is not understood by those opposite is that the CLP speaks with a forked tongue and is absolutely dishonest when it comes to representing the interests of the Northern Territory. It is dishonest when it comes to accepting and acknowledging the importance of this Labor government to the continuing growth in the Northern Territory economy and the security of those people in the Northern Territory who have jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 75c in every dollar spent by the Northern Territory government comes from the federal government. Some 75 per cent of every public servant's wage comes from the federal government and that does not include the public servants whose wages are paid directly by the Commonwealth. We know the spin-off effect on small business. There is not one small business person in the Northern Territory who does not understand the significance of these Commonwealth government outlays and the multiplier effects that they have in the local economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They know where the money comes from. They recognise that there would not be a building industry if it had not been for the federal Labor government. They understand that there would not be strong growth in the local economy and unemployment would not be low if it were not for the federal Labor government. They understand all these things, but they are not acknowledged by the CLP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the CLP does&mdash;and we have an example of this with the local budget&mdash;is wreak havoc on the Northern Territory community by imposing massive increases in taxes and charges on every Northern Territory family. That is quite different from the approach that has been adopted by this government. That provides a very good demarcation between the attitudes of a very progressive, committed Labor government and a very conservative CLP government in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what we would see if those opposite were in government. They have made all these grandiose claims, but we have not seen their policy framework. We know that they would say that there would be no increases in taxes and that there would be tax cuts for their favourites at the top end of town. Those opposite would have to massively cut government outlays. If they massively cut government outlays, who would suffer? It would be the people of the Northern Territory that would suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There could not be a greater contrast between the policies and programs which have been espoused by the opposition in the past and the policies and programs we anticipate it would tell us about&mdash;if it had any new policies&mdash;were it to be in government. We know what those in the opposition are saying. On the public record they have said, `We're going to have no tax increases.' So the revenue base will be fixed but they will provide tax cuts to particular groups of people. We know that they are going to massively cut government outlays, which will affect the lives of every Northern Territory person. I have already mentioned the issue of capital works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting thing about the Northern Territory's own budget, despite the fact that 75 per cent of it comes from the federal Labor government, and as a result of its own measurements, is that the per capita debt level of the Northern Territory community is rising because of the mismanaged Northern Territory economy. Despite the massive outlays from the federal Labor government, the Northern Territory government has mismanaged its own economy and increased the per capita debt level from $8,124 on 30 June 1994 to $8,570 on 30 June 1995. The highest per capita debt level in Australia resides in the Northern Territory as a result of the Northern Territory government's policies. That level of $8,570 for every Northern Territory person compares with an Australian state average of $4,094. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who was responsible for the gross mismanagement of the Northern Territory economy? It was the CLP&mdash;that is, the conservative party colleagues of the member for Maranoa, who is sitting opposite. They are the people who would like to take government from us. Time and time again they have aptly demonstrated that they have absolutely no idea about economic policy. Despite the reliance on federal government outlays, we can see that they have managed to build up debt levels to $8,570 per head. The Northern Territory government has built up those debt levels because of bad policy and poor expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth pointing out that, despite the increases in the educational outlays made by this federal Labor government in its last budget, the Northern Territory's educational performance is abysmal. Because the participation rates in its schools are the lowest in Australia bar none, and because those rates are getting worse, there has been a three per cent decrease in educational expenditure in the Northern Territory's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If things are so important to the Northern Territory government, and if it is concerned about and committed to social justice in the Northern Territory, why would it cut expenditure in education by three per cent when the federal government's own allocations to the Northern Territory for education have increased? What is the explanation? That state government will not go around saying, `I'm sorry we've cut educational outlays.' It will not even tell you it has cut educational outlays. It will not tell you what the impact will be on Aboriginal communities where, if you are lucky, one in 10 have the chance to get to year 12. But we know it has cut educational outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whose responsibility is that? Is it this government's responsibility? No, it is not this government's responsibility but it demonstrates yet again what would happen if our conservative colleagues opposite occupied the treasury bench. They would not care where they cut their funds or allocations. We know that the poorest people, the most disadvantaged people, of the community, bar none, are the Aboriginal people in remote communities in the Northern Territory. They are the people who will suffer the most from this CLP budget, despite the fact, as I have said time and time again, that the bulk of the Northern Territory's revenue comes from the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the Northern Territory government have built up this debt problem. It is solely their responsibility, no-one else's.

I will make sure that I enjoy this moment because it is the last speech on the budget I will be making from this side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since my election, all we have seen from this government is lie after lie after lie. It made many promises at the last election, but it has kept very few. In the 1993 election campaign, we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) make that George Bush like quote&mdash;remember George Bush saying, `Read my lips: no new taxes.' Mr Keating said, in the course of the last election campaign:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are not a promise&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are law&mdash;L.A.W.&mdash;law. And the difference between a legislative tax cut and some Opposition speaker's manifesto is all the world of difference . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As one of my constituents suggested to me, `law' must stand for `lie and win' in the Keating dictionary. Labor's campaign at the last election was more than economical with the truth, and the budgets it has presented since, which have been awfully detrimental to families, have proven its dishonesty and illegitimacy. This government is well known for its pork-barrelling and kow-towing to minority but vocal lobby groups. One group it always fails to recognise is the silent majority&mdash;the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget, when looked at in the context of a family's budget, does very little, if anything, to assist families. Sure, the government has introduced the maternity allowance. That comes in in about nine months, probably around election time. It could otherwise be called a baby bribe. I have been contacted by one constituent who has put this scenario to me: what of those in a lower socio-economic group who, looking at the $816 payment as a good one-off bonus, decide to have a child for the money and are then faced with the prospect of ever after bills as a result of that child?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that is a politically incorrect view, but I do not particularly care about that. The fact is&mdash;and this has been told to me by a financial counsellor in my electorate&mdash;people have children for the additional family payment, and the maternity allowance will be an incentive to have a child, irrespective of the future financial hardship that could be endured by that particular family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking very close to home, my daughter's husband is on a pretty average sort of wage. She says to me, `Dad, how can it be in this lucky country that friends of ours with two children are better off on social security benefits and the husband goes surfing all day? They actually pick up more money than someone who is prepared to work in the work force.' That is a result of this appalling government that we have had for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not opposed to a maternity allowance per se, but I think it needs better planning and careful consideration so that it is used correctly and not seen as an incentive to have a child. Children should be wanted as loved offspring, not as an extra source of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another claim of the government is that the rent assistance increase has been increased to support families. This is given to recipients without any concern for what is done with the assistance. I have been contacted by landlords and property managers who know their tenants are in receipt of the rent assistance, but they do not receive any rent and are forced to evict the tenants. The fact of the matter is that there should be more accountability of those welfare payments. If one is given rent assistance to subsidise rent, it should be ensured that it goes to rent and not alcohol, cigarettes or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My suggestion, again politically incorrect, is that rent assistance should go direct to the landlord or property manager or given in the form of a voucher. That would ensure that landlords are not ripped off. It would assist lower income earners in paying their rent and would keep those families under a roof, with fewer financial problems. That would ultimately keep families closer, rather than divide them as happens when they are confronted with financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome, with reservation, the pilot family service centres. Hopefully, it is not going to be a centre which only tells families what benefits are available but will provide budgeting advice and assistance with child rearing and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many initiatives of this government, under the guise of supporting families, have been to offer a payment or a benefit to them. At the last election the government suggested that the coalition would cut all these different benefits. It was not true of course, but that has never bothered the government too much. It made the claims to encourage people to vote Labor. It treats people on handouts like breastfed babies, only the government does not want to wean them off. The government is of the opinion that if one is in receipt of a government handout one is therefore reliant on the government and the Labor Party and will therefore keep voting Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a view is against the will and principles of mainstream Australia, but Labor cares little for them, only for electoral success. So it uses the hard-earned taxes of Australians to buy votes, irrespective of the impact on our economy, on our debt, the detrimental effect it has on our social fabric, or any other effect. Families do not need governments telling them how to live, how to bring up their kids, which parent should work, whether both parents should work or whatever. This government, however, is ever so keen to be a part of every family and in most cases wants to be the head of the house. It wants to tell families what is right and what is not right. With the many benefits, allowances and so forth, why could the government not give the promised tax cuts? The unemployed, pensioners and low income earners could still get their benefits but those who are earning a dollar should be assisted not through benefits or payments but through tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remaining on the topic of families, one of the things absent from this budget and which I will be looking to encourage in the next coalition government is that with each budget a family impact statement should be included. Indeed, a family impact statement should be prepared not just for budgets but for many other pieces of legislation. We have environmental impact statements, so what is wrong with having a family impact statement? The family is, I should remind the House, the cornerstone of our Australian society. I believe it is around the family unit that every budget and every piece of legislation should be framed. Too often we have legislation introduced, sometimes with good intent, other times without, but which, whatever its intentions, does nothing for families. It does not consider the impact on them. It does not reflect their desires or aspirations or concerns. There is no reflection on how legislation or budgets actually affect the husbands and wives and children in a personal sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we cannot have a statement explaining everything, but a family impact statement honestly presented would tell us a bit more about how the budget directly impacts on families, rather than offering us a book full of figures, percentages, graphs and tables. In that way it brings us back to reflecting on how we can ensure that the budgets that are brought down and the legislation that is introduced are family oriented. I know the government released a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An agenda for families</EMPHASIS>, but that is not a family impact statement; it does not explain the effects of the budget on the family or the cost of the budget to the average family; it simply regurgitates the glossy bribes of the budget&mdash;bribes, I might add, which are not necessarily conducive to supporting the family structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get so many letters to my office from mothers, fathers and homemakers asking me: `Why can't the government balance its budget? Why do the homemakers have to tighten their belts when the government does not? Why do we have to balance our books week after week when the government does not set an example and do the same?' This is another example of how the budget does not reflect the pressures on families. The government's budget must take a global perspective and consider international trends, developments and influences, but at the same time it should also be brought down for Australians, both individuals and families alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My suggestion to the Treasurer, therefore&mdash;it may sound condescending but I still think it is worth trying&mdash;is this: when framing the next budget, why not sit down with a dozen homemakers, people who know they have to balance their budgets, and seek some advice from them&mdash;go through every item of expenditure, explain it and its purpose and see whether they agree with it? If they know they cannot overspend they won't and they don't. Their advice would help the government in formulating its budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They would not, for example, give $10 million to the trade union movement to train Labor hacks. This budget gives $10.1 million to the Australian Trade Union Training Authority. Between this budget and the 1998-99 budget, $46.3 million will go to the authority which, to quote the budget paper, is established `to develop, deliver and provide assistance in relation to the training of union officials and members'. If the government were advised by homemakers, who know the difficulties of balancing household budgets, the union movement would not get a cent and would be expected to earn its own funds through membership acquired through proper representation, which it appears to have forgotten all about. Taxpayers should not fund the union movement, particularly in view of its allegiance to the Labor Party. Essentially it is the Labor Party giving taxpayers' money to the union movement to funnel back to the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I will go back to my point about having a table of advisers of homemakers to assist in giving the budget a family perspective and ensure that the budget does not go off the track, is not inhuman and meets the challenges faced by households, that is, of balancing the budget and not needing to sell the crockery to pay for the groceries, as we have seen this time around. It is but another way of de-bureaucratising the budget, giving it a human touch and getting away from the ivory tower approach which underpins this government and its decisions. Having said that families should be the central focus of the budget, I will turn to how families fare in this budget and how they have fared since the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election families were promised tax cuts. As I said previously, the Prime Minister said that the tax cuts were law&mdash;l-a-w, law. These were the One Nation tax cuts that were promised. Remember the One Nation statement?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the other ways in which the Labor government has hit families since the last election. It has increased the price of petrol, with leaded fuel going up more than unleaded fuel. It has done this while forgetting the fact that low income families, the people who did not get any tax cuts, are the ones who often drive the cars needing leaded petrol. It has increased the fringe benefits tax, a business tax which is passed onto the consumers. It has increased sales tax across the board. That has increased the price of items such as fruit juice, ice-cream, biscuits and flavoured milk. It also has increased the price of items such as toilets, bathroom fittings, hot-water systems, blinds, furniture, carpets, stoves, dishwashers, and so on. Those items go onto the price of a home or onto renovations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make matters worse, this budget applies the 12 per cent wholesale sales tax onto building materials. This government is taxing the great Australian dream out of the hands of young Australians. How will young families ever get a start when you tax the price of houses out of their reach? Housing prices are going through the roof simply to pay for your various bribes, which are being held out in a cheap and desperate attempt to hold onto office. One of the major goals of every single family is home ownership. It is the great Australian dream. This Labor government is taxing the great Australian dream out of the reach of young Australians and young families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members know that one of the major causes of family break-up is financial difficulties. This added tax burden on the family home, coupled with the government's other tax increases, undelivered tax cuts or forced unemployment as a result of the government's policies, will not keep families together but force them apart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in this budget we have had the Medicare levy rise by another 0.1 of one per cent, having previously increased from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent. This means that families will pay more for health care. But there is no sign of falling hospital waiting lists and no sign of incentives for families to utilise private health insurance&mdash;only a bigger threat to a crumbling health system, and that is bad news for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relating this back to the family impact statement, one must ask: how many children are on hospital waiting lists; how many mothers and fathers, grandmothers and grandfathers are waiting for elective surgery which they cannot have because they are not privately insured and must wait because Medicare is not working for them? The government has increased the Medicare levy; it will cost people another $30-odd per year but will do nothing to fix the fundamental problems associated with Medicare. How many families are still suffering because our health system leaves them on an endless waiting list?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been an increase in the tobacco excise. I do not like smoking; if the government wants to end smoking, why not support and assist the Western Australian health minister to outlaw smoking? But the fact is that this excise increase was another dishonest tax increase on those who can least afford it. As I say, I do not like smoking and I will always discourage it. But that tax measure still hits the hip-pocket nerve of a great many families in Australia. </PARA>

If you look at what has happened over the 12-year period to which you refer, real household disposable incomes have risen by 40 per cent; the value of the social wage provisions targeted to people on low incomes has improved out of sight; pensions have risen in real terms by around 12 per cent; assistance to low income families has increased by around 150 per cent in real terms for families with children in the 13 to 15 age group and by 75 per cent for those with children in younger age categories; and so on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever figure you are quoting. I am talking about your most recent press release, claiming that they are $27 a week worse off after you take into account tax and rebates. That calculation is an utter distortion for a whole variety of reasons. The principal point, I suppose, is that it completely fails to take into account that, over the last 12 years under the accord framework, we have had an explicit trade-off between social wage and money wage rises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that social wage translate into? In a recent paper the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra estimated the value of social wage benefits provided through health, housing, child care and education as worth $195 per week on average for a two-child family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at what has changed over that 12-year period, I have had some estimates done which show that that social wage component is two to three times greater now than it was in 1982 under the coalition. There has been an increase of at least $100 a week in real terms in the value of those social wage provisions&mdash;health, housing, education and child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you take child care, the number of places has grown over that period from 46,000 to 263,000. Education participation rates have increased from around 36 per cent completing year 12 to around 80 per cent now. You can translate those into dollars for typical families with children. Any analysis which fails to take account of that is completely misleading.

These social wage improvements have been delivered by this government within the framework of the accord and mean real tangible benefits to families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are precisely the sorts of programs that the opposition would cut to shreds were it to be elected to government. If it is going to cut billions of dollars off government outlays, it is talking about hacking into precisely those education, health, housing and child-care programs which have delivered such substantial benefits to middle income and low income families. If it is talking about low income families in particular, the real value of that safety net has been improved out of sight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interpretations that have been put on the Gregory paper by the Leader of the Opposition and others are completely misleading.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that, under the government's industrial relations reform act, the safety net underpinning bargaining includes all existing federal award conditions as well as national minimum standards based upon our ILO treaty obligations. These minimum entitlements guarantee all workers access to a fair minimum wage, equal pay for work of equal value, 12 months unpaid parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bargaining process under our act, there is scope for employees to voluntarily trade some conditions so long as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is convinced that workers are not worse off in total&mdash;not worse off in the end result. That, of course, is the no disadvantage test. We know that that test is absolutely fundamental in terms of providing a guaranteed safety net for employees in the federal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of that comprehensive safety net&mdash;a safety net that will be regularly updated&mdash;is the major reason why the federal government has been so much more successful than any of the state jurisdictions in the development, encouragement and making of enterprise bargains.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition tried to reassure the public by saying that under him there would be an opt-out provision, not an opt-in provision. If we look at it and analyse it, we find that all it does is take us back to the 1990 version of Jobsback, right back to where we were a couple of elections ago. It is a version where employees can allegedly choose to stay on their award, but, like everything else the Leader of the Opposition does, there is a big hitch. That hitch is this: the award is never updated over time. The award is frozen for ever more and there is no provision for updating it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the safety net for all the new employees or for anyone who changes his or her job? They find themselves not with any award protection but with the four miserly minimum conditions contained in Jobsback. As the opposition leader has made clear, all that workers will have statutory protection for is the minimum hourly wage, 12 months unpaid maternity leave, four weeks annual leave and two weeks non-cumulative sick leave&mdash;end of story. That is Jobsback 1990 style.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the opposition leader really meant yesterday when he said that under the coalition there will be a proper safety net. This is exactly the sort of safety net that he envisages. Obviously, as far as he is concerned, entitlements such as penalty rates, leave loadings, restrictions on working hours, shift allowances, skills supplements or family leave will not be part of his proper safety net&mdash;not on your nelly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dare say that the battlers, whom the opposition leader says he wants to help, may see it just a little differently. He is certainly guaranteeing them a very great battle for their wages. There is no doubt about that. The families he is fond of talking about might look at him just a little differently when they see him mugging the conditions of the very families that he says he is there to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, it does not matter whether the opposition has an opt-in or opt-out provision. That will not mean anything to those people&mdash;nothing whatsoever. What they will understand is that the opposition still intends to take the machete to their award safety net and cut it to pieces, destroying in the process their entitlements to protection against unfair dismissal. I conclude by saying this time will be the same as before: Australian workers will not have a bar of it.</PARA>

The huge potential that comes from all states agreeing to go to the table with the Commonwealth on this is that it gives us the critical mass to get the costs down, to get the access reach away from just urban centres to include the regional centres, and to provide a much more effective market for product going into the network. In essence, this is about using the information superhighway to meet our education and training needs.</PARA>

Despite some important progress in this area in the last few years, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are still the most disadvantaged in our community when it comes to, amongst other things, education needs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Self-funded retirees, along with a lot of other people, were beneficiaries of the first tranche of tax cuts which were delivered by the government. Aside from that, the changes that have been announced that affect retirement incomes in this budget provide enormous benefits. If opposition members are talking about self-funded retirees, they will notice that a very high proportion of people receiving the pension nowadays, particularly new entrants to the pension system, also derive their income from other sources&mdash;from superannuation, pensions and investments. They will be very major beneficiaries from the changes that we have announced to the income testing arrangements for pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>

The answer is that Liberal governments are incapable of developing effective economic policy. For the first time last month the South Australian unemployment rate fell below 10 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Kooyong makes reference to the recent EPAC paper on income distribution in Australia. I have made a bit of a study of that paper, and I am familiar with a few of the statistics contained therein. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to enlighten the House on a few key points. The first point is that the EPAC paper confirmed that, in terms of distribution of earnings, people's earnings from market incomes&mdash;wages, salaries, et cetera&mdash;there has been in this country, as throughout the developed world, some increase in earnings disparities. That is true, but let us put it in perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent figure for Australia&mdash;and it is tabulated in this EPAC paper&mdash;based on 1989 statistics shows that we have gone from something like 2.08 to 2.27, as the ratio of earnings from people 10 per cent from the top to those people 10 per cent from the bottom. So it is about 2.27 now. Yes, it has become more unequal. But let us contrast that with the United States where the corresponding ratio is 5.6; the United Kingdom where the corresponding ratio is about 3.4; and France where the ratio is 3.2 and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only countries that were shown in the EPAC table as having a more equal distribution of earnings than Australia were the Scandinavian countries and Italy. Not only is the absolute level of inequality here, in terms of earned incomes less than in those countries, but the rate of growth in inequality has been far greater in those countries that have pursued the wholesale deregulation of labour markets and the slashing of the social wage; that is, precisely the policy prescriptions of the opposition. That is the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the EPAC report was absolutely explicit. While there has been that underlying trend towards greater inequality in earnings, which has resulted from a range of factors&mdash;globalisation of the world economy, the impact of technology and so forth&mdash;the impact of government policy, that is, changes made through the tax and social security transfer system and the social wage, has been unambiguously benign. In other words, it has acted to offset and retard any underlying trend towards greater inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put that in perspective, to show the importance of these social wage considerations, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, which I referred to in my first answer, estimates that the disparity between the average incomes of those in the top 20 per cent and those in the bottom 20 per cent will drop from 13:1 to 4:1 when you add in social wage elements to the market incomes. That is a crucial point. When the opposition professes its concern about inequality and says we should take an axe to these social programs, it is utter hypocrisy on the opposition's part. That is another key point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, there are underlying trends to greater inequalities in market incomes throughout the developed world. Government policy in this country has been benign in serving to offset and retard that underlying trend. We have put in place an unambiguously stronger safety net. In real terms, the payments that go to those who are least well off have improved substantially and they have improved in relative terms as against the incomes received by the rest in society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition likes to quote studies. It talks about the Gregory work. I was on ABC radio with Bob Gregory talking about the import of his study. He basically confirmed the accuracy of what I was saying, that this alleged trend towards lower income in the bottom one per cent of areas probably reflects a compositional change resulting from much greater targeting of public housing, which accounts for about 5 1/2 per cent of the dwelling stock, to those on low incomes and those in need&mdash;unemployed, sole parents, et cetera. If we compare this government's performance to the performance of the coalition and to the performance over the last 10 to 15 years of governments that have pursued the kind of policy mix that the opposition favours, it is just the utmost hypocrisy for the opposition to come in here and start complaining about inequality.</PARA>

Those people who employ labour in the construction industry have signed a document to say that there is a place in this industry for the trade union movement and, what is more, that cooperation alone will bring the sorts of changes that this industry requires.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further on it goes. For instance, it says that employers should establish and maintain effective systems for good occupational health and safety, which is a real worker concern, but one that employers need to work on. There have been practices like last on, first off, where there was an arbitrary application. If there had to be redundancies the last one on the job was always the first one knocked off. That does not leave you with a position where the most skilful people are kept on a job when you have to downsize. It is acknowledged that that sort of practice is not good for efficiency and ought to be done away with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to overtime a practice had developed whereby if one received overtime all ought to receive overtime, which was costly and inefficient. Both unions and employers have now agreed that that sort of practice should be abolished. There was the whole debate that revolved around inclement weather&mdash;people would knock off if it began to rain. It is true that during inclement weather it can be very dangerous on construction sites and that people should cease work. But it is possible, nevertheless, for employers to arrange work so that people can work indoors, or be taken away and given some training during those times.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. His interest in the aid field and in non-governmental organisations is, I think, well known in this place, and I am pleased he is taking an interest in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can confirm that the Code of Practice Advisory Committee, which I established, held its first meeting earlier this week and got off to a good start. In that connection, I would like to thank the honourable member for Aston and the honourable member for Franklin who are, themselves, members of the committee and who, I think, contributed valuably to its work; along with non-governmental organisations, who are part of it; and also the accountancy profession, which has nominated representatives to it. It is true that I have asked the advisory committee to report back within three months with a proposed code of practice which would not only meet the information requirements of government and also be easily understood by the non-governmental organisation community but also, and most importantly, help the public to make informed decisions about how their donations are spent and reassure the donating public that they can have full confidence in the accountability of non-governmental organisations and their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect the code of practice to have two main components: a code of ethics, which builds on and gives recognition to the ACFOA code of ethics; and a separate part covering financial reporting standards. I want to make it clear that I see the code of practice as being an interim tool, until there has been full implementation of the Industry Commission's recommendations from its recent report on accounting standards for the charity sector, the community social welfare sector, of which NGOs are a part. But because that will involve amendments to state legislation&mdash;the legislation of all states&mdash;I suspect that will be some time well in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the code of practice is being developed with the extensive collaboration of the non-government organisation community, I hope they will have a very high degree of association with its recommendations and support for the code.

One option I will be looking at carefully is whether NGO compliance with the code would be a prerequisite for tax deductibility status, which the government gives each year at the cost of something like $50 million in forgone taxation revenue, and/or whether it should be linked to the provision of further government support in the form of grants channelled through those NGOs for their development activities. I will be very interested in any recommendation from the committee which goes to those questions.</PARA>

It was not reduced as a measure to encourage lead-free petrol. It was introduced as a countercyclical measure to boost that industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been a number of complaints over the years with respect to the time that it has taken for claims to be processed by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There have been many thousands of claims in the system. In 1991 my department undertook the development of an expert compensation claims processing system. Because of the fact that it was  leading edge technology, it took a fair while to implement. But teams in all states are now very proficient in processing claims. That was one of the first initiatives that we brought in. It was brought in while the member for Griffith was the minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative associated with the processing of claims has been the introduction of the Repatriation Medical Authority. As a result of statements of principles that it brings out every now and again, there is now some consistency from state to state with respect to how claims are processed. Productivity has improved noticeably. Recently, staff and management have gained experience and familiarity with the new processes and systems. It is expected that maximum efficiency in production will be achieved by mid-1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, since the beginning of March, average weekly national output has exceeded intake by 161 cases per week. The average time taken to process compensation claims stands at 103 days for the March quarter, which is down by 30 per cent on the time taken under the old system. In fact, some claims have been processed all the way through to payment in one day. In addition, I have asked for a claims workshop to be conducted with ex-service communities where we are trying to get to the bottom of the claim from the word go so that perhaps we can fix it up at the primary level and get the answer right the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as part of a broader review, this year I asked the department to look at whether there could be ways of knocking down the quite large overflow of appeals to the Veterans Review Board. I am happy to say that reviews have been undertaken in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. The initial estimate is that about 40 to 50 per cent of Veterans Review Board appeals will be resolved by this particular review, either by the reviewing officer granting the claim or by the applicant withdrawing the appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am aware of it. I am conscious of the fact that, in this remembrance year, we do not want to keep them waiting too long. I think the steps we have taken have achieved a much better result.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Lastly, as an opening remark, I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition because he has basically hit the political mark. You know that because the Prime Minister had his minders out in the gallery last night with a seven-page so-called rebuttal. I can tell you that it ain't worth the paper it is written on, but in the bit I have still got left in my hand it says something about the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could picture him in his office in a state of fairly considerable agitation. He would be saying, `Take this down, take this down,' and some scribe would be in the corner writing it all down. When he is in that mood, when he is in that situation, he is absolutely guaranteed to go over the top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you read the fine print of what he said, you will see that he said something about housing interest rates, which shows that he knows absolutely nothing about the topic. The other thing he said in response to the Leader of the Opposition saying that people are basically $27 per week worse off in the last 12 or 13 years was, `No, that's not right. They are actually $12 a week better off&mdash;not $27 worse off but $12 a week better off.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the Prime Minister's figures. I have seen so many of them over the years. No-one in his right mind would accept them. After 12 years of hard Labor, if having $106 billion worth of debt, having been through the worst recession in 60 years, having record levels of long-term unemployed and having record levels of young people unemployed is the best the government can do, I say to the coalition parties: let us use the government's figure. If $12 a week is the best that we have achieved as a result of 12 years of Labor, in my view that in itself is game, set and match to our side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of the MPI is to point out one of the principal reasons this country has performed at a level so less than its potential would otherwise provide and the reason that mediocrity has been the hallmark of this government: the government's failure to introduce genuine reforms in the Australian labour market. The Leader of the Opposition hit his mark when he made this point yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To perhaps give credence to the Prime Minister's agitation last night, I point out that when two Labor Party people were walking in the corridor this morning&mdash;in fact, they were a senior, well-known and liked minister and the federal secretary of the Labor Party&mdash;certain remarks passed between them. The minister said to the secretary, `How are things going?' The response was, `Not bad under the circumstances. But this B'&mdash;referring to the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;`is going to make life very hard for us.' Never a truer word was said. Life is going to get a lot harder for these guys before we get to the next election. If the government wants an early election, I say bring it on. The sooner we make some substantial changes to the economic management of this country, the better off we will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I particularly want to focus on one aspect of Labor's industrial relations reform as an example of its complete failure right across the board beyond the labour market and into general economic issues and management. There have certainly been changes in the industrial relations area, and some have been in the right direction. But the truth of the matter is that, by and large, in the vast majority of cases the changes that have been made have been made by employers and employees in spite of the government's labour market system and not because of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular case study I bring to the House's attention relates to the unfair dismissal laws. These laws were introduced as part of the reform package after the 1993 election. In fact, they were part of a package which was one of the most gross examples of payback to the trade union movement we have ever had in this country. In response to union support in the last election, the government basically allowed the unions to have a predominant say in the reform of the industrial relations system that was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the starting point for the reforms we have had, I ask those of my colleagues who are in the chamber: what do the following countries&mdash;Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Malawi, Morocco, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and about 10 others&mdash;have in common with Australia? They have all ratified ILO convention 158, the termination of employment convention. The significance of this is that the government has ratified a convention that very few other countries have ratified. If Zaire, Malawi and Morocco are the standards by which we are to run industrial relations in this country, we have a few problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government signed that ILO convention and used it to basically change constitutional arrangements in Australia to introduce a new federal law. This new federal law was supposed to give employees a right of appeal in the event that they were unfairly or unjustly dismissed. Right at the outset I say that there ought to be a proper course of appeal for people who are sacked so that they can ensure that their grievances are properly heard. Let us face it: from time to time some employers will do the wrong thing. They will get no truck from us. There ought to be in place a system to properly safeguard the interests of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system the Labor Party has introduced is an absolute disgrace. Let me just give a few examples as time permits. An interesting case involves Qantas. This was a case where a male employee obtained access to Qantas's computer booking records to obtain the name of a female passenger. He rang this female passenger and made certain propositions. The management of Qantas hauled this bloke in and said, `Your access to our computer records is not for this purpose and, if we catch you again, you are out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within a few months this same guy was into the records&mdash;not of passengers this time, but of female Qantas employees who had applied for overtime. This bloke was harassing Qantas staff. So they got him in, sacked him on the basis that they had given him one warning, which I thought was generous enough, and he was out. Under Labor's system, because of claims in respect of procedures, this guy was reinstated and got 17 grand&mdash;17,000 bucks. He was sacked&mdash;and, in my view, he should have stayed sacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give you another case involving a Queensland university. These matters are pretty sensitive, as we are all aware. The university had allegations of a university lecturer exploiting female students. The university was very careful in the way in which it proceeded in examining this issue and this guy basically got the sack. Under the system set up by Labor, the university's committee decision was said to contain errors of law as there was no proper finding of serious misconduct as defined in the award. In other words, this guy was reinstated not because of the substantive issues but because of the procedural system set up by this minister. That guy was sacked and he should have remained sacked. When the minister responds I would like a specific statement from him on some of these specific cases which he claims do not exist. What about Conagra? This is a case where a bloke had 35 days absent from work over two years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Farrell and Conagra Wool is the name of the case. This guy had had 35 days absent over two years. Of those 35 days, he had 20 days where he did not produce a medical certificate. The system is that if you take a sickie you have to front up the next day with a medical certificate. This bloke had day No. 36 absent from work and still did not have a certificate. The employer said, `Enough is enough; you're out.' This guy lodged an unfair dismissal claim. It was found that on the day he claimed the sickie he had actually turned up to his old man's birthday party. Yet the court ordered his reinstatement. He got 11,600 bucks and the basis of the decision was that the company had to prove that he had not been sick. That is just absolutely outrageous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the prison warder? This prison warder struck up a liaison with an inmate; she associated with the prisoner, which is against regulations; she took letters in and out of the prison. She got sacked and then put in a claim of lack of procedural fairness. What happened? She got compensation of $3,500. That is absolutely outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are cases where it is against the employer. Of course, for those who are in a job today and want to go to another job, it will make life very difficult for them to get another job, to transfer, because employers will say, `Why should I give them a job? If there are any problems I am going to be stuck with the problem.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you another case. An employer gave an employee a reference because they were parting company. The employer said, `It is a small country town. I will give you a reference to help you get a job.' That is not an unreasonable thing to do. The employer glossed over the employee's defects&mdash;many have done that. What happened? The bloke lodged an application for unfair dismissal. He turned up before the registrar, the registrar read the reference, saw that it was a good reference, and the employer&mdash;a farmer who hardly had two dollars to rub together&mdash;had to fork out compensation of 12 grand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now cite an unreported case. It is worth mentioning this case because a lot of these cases are not reported. The minister will stand up there and quote figures about how few cases have been heard before the judicial registrar. But the fact is that employers have a choice. They can go on and fight, but the whole system is stacked against them and they will probably lose, so they might as well cough up. The running cost is about eight grand. It is no wonder that employers are complaining from one end of the country to the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, a foreigner obtained work on the condition that she could have the job as long as she had a work permit. At the end of the work permit, she was dismissed. She lodged an unfair dismissal application. The hospital went to the solicitor and the solicitor said, `Well, the unfair dismissal laws have precedence over the immigration laws, so the employee is in the right'&mdash;even though the work permit had expired. The cases are legion. I have a list as long as your arm. I have loads and loads of them, and they are open and shut cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the opposition saying this. Your factional colleague the Premier of New South Wales is saying exactly the same thing. He will not even amend his laws to reflect yours, because he will not have a bar of his laws having to reflect the ILO conventions. He is proceeding with an appeal in the High Court which was initiated by the last Liberal government&mdash;so bad are your laws. When Bob Carr started to attack your laws, being the typical Labor leader that he is, he said, `I can make these remarks because my union colleagues in New South Wales agree with me.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just us saying this, and it is not just the employers saying this. Yesterday a Federal Court judge said that the whole system is there to provide rights to the employees&mdash;but to the total exclusion of employers. It makes no sense.

All these people would get under the opposition would be those four Dickensian minimum standards contained in Jobsback, and these were Dickensian standards a century ago.

There are outfits like Optus, Woodside Petroleum and Toys `R' Us. Some 60 per cent of all federal award employees are now in the enterprise bargaining process. Then there are your own states. Western Australia is languishing on eight per cent. Tasmania has a pitiful three per cent. Victoria's system has become a shell of its former self thanks to the policies of Phil Gude.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare the results that we have achieved in terms of the underlying rate of inflation that has been brought about by enterprise bargaining under our Industrial Relations Reform Act.

Some 320,000 of those jobs have been created since the new IR act came into effect. This is the act that was going to be a dampener on employment. There have been 320,000 new jobs in 13 months. We have average wages growth of four to five per cent for people under agreements against that background of a two to three per cent rate of underlying inflation. Under our provisions we have three $8 safety net adjustments for those who cannot get agreements. We have the lowest level of industrial disputation in Australia for 50 years. </PARA>

It is harder still when people think back and remember the wage breakouts, the high inflation, the high unemployment and the industrial mayhem that characterised the Australian industrial scene in the early 1980s under yourselves, particularly when the man presiding over the whole show was none other than your present federal leader. </PARA>

I do not raise this unpleasant spectre to gloat on the demise of the New South Wales Labor Party, but to illustrate how easily the party's sleazy way of doing business might, through the perversion of industry law, dissipate hard won gains and destroy the new employer-employee relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent of the government comes through clearly in a number of measures&mdash;the pay-off to the union apparatchiks for election funding favours. I will cite three of them. The first was the effective dismantling of the secondary boycott provisions. The second was the Hodder ruling on union intervention into enterprise bargaining, which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was shamed into disowning. The third was the now unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;a would-be proper document that takes the ILO provisions to their ridiculous extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this third issue of unfair dismissal provisions that we are debating here today. In this House on 28 October 1993 the Minister for Industrial Relations concluded his second reading speech on the Industrial Relations Reform Act with the following remark:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the enactment of this bill the onus will be on the industrial relations players&mdash;it is their opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>It was pleasing to see the minister acknowledge that a less centralised and less unionised form of industrial relations was the way to go. But his words did not match his actions, particularly when it came to the unfair dismissal provisions of the new Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister talked about it being an opportunity for the industrial relations players, both employers and employees. But the evidence shows that, over the last 14 months, since these provisions were put in place, there has been no equal opportunity. The minister said he handed the IR ball to the players but when it comes to someone being sent off&mdash;that is, termination of employment&mdash;the rules are biased in favour of one team, which is the employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfair dismissal laws are something akin to Queensland running onto the field tonight against the Blues in the State of Origin. But the rules that have changed state that the Maroons cannot tackle their opponents or, if they do, they have to give five weeks notice. </PARA>

What about small employers? What about small businesses which do not have the same huge resources to contest the costly and lengthy court battles? The shadow minister just identified that on average it costs $8 1/2 thousand to upturn an unfair dismissal claim. Small businesses are the big losers in the new IR game. They are the hardworking Australians, and I want to concentrate on them in my remaining five minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, let me clearly state that I do not condone any employer who abuses, or unfairly treats, his or her workers. I abhor exploitation. I abhor underpayment. I abhor workplace intimidation. I do believe in fair play in a fair contest, but the current unfair dismissal provisions do not allow for a good, fair or clean game. That is not just my view. An editorial in today's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The so-called unfair dismissal rules no longer beg the question: unfair to whom?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A judge of the Industrial Relations Court has made no bones about it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a recent ruling Justice Peter Gray said the federal legislation, in contrast to the approach adopted in most state jurisdictions, was not intended fairly to balance the interests of employers and employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unfair-dismissal provisions amounted to a charter of rights for employees, directed towards protecting their existing jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>That confirms what the shadow minister said, and it gives the lie to the minister's rebuttal in the speech he made just a few moments ago. Further, the editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the IR court has held, a valid reason for dismissal is no longer sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the complicated and protracted procedures have to be followed to the letter.</PARA>
<PARA>Today's editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> makes its point very clearly. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demise of a fundamental industrial discipline&mdash;the right to dismiss a badly behaved employee&mdash;is a serious mistake. It will only bring trouble to the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the last 14 months, since the new Industrial Relations Act became effective, there has been what some commentators describe as an avalanche of unfair dismissal claims. In Queensland today, the MTIA has seven industrial officers in the field. Would you believe that five of those are tied up in wrongful dismissal claims? That is outrageous and totally unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to analyse the figures from the Department of Industrial Relations, which show that 6,790 federal applications have been lodged for unfair dismissal. About 60 per cent of those have been finalised, but over 96 per cent of those finalised have been settled out of court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister points to these statistics as evidence that the new provisions are working and are not overly prohibitive. Nothing could be further from the truth. The rules are so stacked against them that employers do not even want to run onto the minister's new industrial relations field. Because of the so-called procedural fairness, cost and uncertainty, they readily vacate the field. It is just not worth their while, or their bank balance, to contest the actions. The Queensland Director of the Metal Trades Industry Association, Paul Fennelly, said in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many employers were astounded that blatantly obvious reasons for dismissal did not apply if procedural requirements were not strictly observed.</PARA>
<PARA>Already the shadow minister has cited plenty of examples. Another interesting example is that of a woman prison officer who was dismissed for a having a relationship with a prisoner and who was awarded $5,000 compensation by the IR court. Although the prison officer's action amounted to serious misconduct, the court found she had been denied procedural fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IR court reinstated a worker who was dismissed after wielding an iron bar during a scuffle. The court found the employer had failed to give the worker a proper hearing. Then there was the case, cited in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, of the former employee who pleaded guilty of theft and was convicted, and then was reinstated on appeal because it was said that procedural fairness had not taken place. These are just a few examples of what employers are facing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this matter of public importance, the opposition is debating the wrong issue because, over the last 10 years, Australia has seen plenty of genuine labour market reforms. This government undertook the historic transformation to take Australia from post-Federation settlement, when industrial relations was centralised in a court in Melbourne, to establish an enterprise based system in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to appreciate is that only Labor could have achieved it. Only Labor could have made the transformation, because it had the cooperative mechanism with the ACTU to do those things in genuine cooperation with the Australian work force. If the Liberal Party had ever tried that through the 1980s, or now in the 1990s, its record would have shown confrontation, disputation and the closing down of Australian industry as a result of strike after strike. Only Labor could have made the transformation from a fully centralised industrial relations system to the enterprise base that now exists in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an achievement that has been. What an achievement to have 60 per cent of federal award workers under enterprise agreements. Not only the volume but also the quality of those agreements is an achievement. Seventy per cent of the 2,200 agreements under the IR reform act have covered enterprises with fewer than 100 employees. So small and medium size business in Australia is taking a big share of the enterprise bargaining opportunities. Not only that but 75 per cent of the agreements address specific productivity measures and issues at the workplace where they count most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are productivity based wage movements under way in Australia. They are good for the workplace, good for the nation and particularly good for the government's aspirations of holding down inflation to its historically low level. So these genuinely enterprise based agreements have transformed the nature of the work place in Australia. Productivity is up, inflation is remaining low and enterprises are getting on with the task of formulating their own workplace arrangements. On top of that, there has been a bonus of 640,000 new jobs since March 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful for the House and for opposition members to compare that outstanding record to the industrial relations record of the Tory states. What is happening in the Tory states of Victoria and Western Australia? In Victoria, 400,000 employees have left the Kennett industrial relations system, have left the system as an empty shell. In Western Australia, the government has achieved just eight per cent of enterprise bargaining under its state award coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This emphasises the strength of Labor's approach. The achievements by this government have not happened by accident. I think this is fair to say: there should be little debate across this parliament on the virtues of industrial relations flexibility; the real debate is about how to do it. The real debate is about the systems, the laws and regulations that are needed to entrench industrial relations flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is this: the ALP has a model that is based on enterprise agreements. It is based on cooperation in the workplace, cooperation with the trade union movement, building a sense of shared goals and collective interests in the workplace. That is the sort of model a sophisticated trading nation at the bottom of the Asia-Pacific needs to develop to be competitive. That is what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition never understands that the most important economic unit is not the individual, not the government, not anything in between. The most important economic unit is the enterprise&mdash;enterprises in Australia that produce, export and employ. Enterprises need to determine in a collective fashion, within their own workplace, the industrial relations arrangements that best suit their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the coalition does not understand that because it has an obsession with the individual. It always wants individualised employment contracts, never enterprise agreements, because the coalition does not like or trust workers. It does not like or trust trade unions. It wants a system that is one on one, dog eat dog. It does not want the Australian way of working out cooperative and collective arrangements in the workplace; it wants something that is deeply individualised and deeply confrontational. </PARA>

I would like to quote an article from a local newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blacktown Sun</EMPHASIS>, which quotes Independent Councillor Corbin. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said Blacktown Council was against the plan right from the start and was the secretariat of an anti-airport organisation in the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cr Corbin produced an old sticker, No Planes For Western Plains, and blamed the then Labor Cr Roger Price, now Federal MP for Chifley, for helping bring the airport to Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to plead guilty. I have to say that the Labor Party organisation in my area did have a tradition of being against an airport. I suppose, as a new federal member of parliament, one of my most nervous moments was to report to my FEC and seek its support for a campaign to get an international airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the day in 1999 when we can see the airport, the campaign having advanced from the early 1980s to getting a general airport in the 1990s. This government and the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) have had the courage and foresight to commit in total $762 million towards developing a fully international airport open for business in 1999, and not only that but also planning the rail link on the south-western side and putting a lot of money into roadworks. Just near my electorate&mdash;it used to be on the border of my electorate&mdash;Elizabeth Drive is being made into a four-lane road. So of course I am excited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am even more excited and proud of the fact that this airport will have maximum employment of about 10,500 during construction. It will have about 500 to 900 employees when it is finished. In the western suburbs of Sydney there will be a flow-on effect of some further 10,500 jobs. I do not apologise for advocating an airport. I take some delight that an independent councillor like Alderman Corbin would suggest that somehow I am to blame. I am to blame, but I say to Alderman Corbin that perhaps he needs to reassess his position and try to sample the mood of the people of western Sydney because they are behind this airport. They are excited about the fact that jobs will be created. The airport will have a catalytic effect in the western suburbs of Sydney. It will make a lot of businesses, both domestic and international, take into account the place where I live, the western suburbs of Sydney, in a way that they have never done before. So I am looking forward to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the minister is funding three further studies to update the EIS that was done in the 1980s. There is $1 million in this budget to protect air and water quality and to develop accurate noise exposure forecasts. So we will be able to undertake a proper community consultation process with the people of western Sydney. I am pleased that the minister has made that clear. He said to the western suburbs members of parliament&mdash;and I thank him for that as well&mdash;that they will be part of that process; it will be wider than them but they will be part of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an exciting development for the western suburbs of Sydney. It has been given to us by a Labor government. I suspect that only a Labor government would do it. It will provide immediate and certainly medium- and long-term benefits. So, Councillor Corbin, I do not know what you said at the Blacktown Council meeting but I am happy to plead guilty to having been part of the process that changed the prevailing views of the Labor Party in my part of the world to support an international airport. It has certainly been supported by the people of the western suburbs of Sydney. Perhaps you ought to try to consult with them from time to time to ascertain their opinions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one issue I would like to raise because I have been asked by a number of people about it, and that is what would happen to Prospect dam or any other part of western Sydney should airlines vent their fuel.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was speaking about superannuation. I was trying to make the point in my earlier contribution that I am very proud as a Labor member of this government to see the advances we have made in superannuation. I was running through the impact of the government's initiatives. There is $180 billion in superannuation savings at the moment. With the benefit of the government's initiatives, this will grow to $500 billion by the year 2000 and $2,000 billion in 20 years time&mdash;a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to bandy these figures around, but what does it mean? It means that the working men and women of Australia will be able to better provide for their own retirement. We will still have a pension as a safety net underpinning retirement income policy, but many more people will have access to their savings and will enjoy a better quality of life. If this is not a family policy, I do not know what is. It is much more than that, important though that may be. It also means that we are addressing the issue of national savings, which is something the country has not done well in the past. Governments on both sides of the House need to accept responsibility for that. It will have a profound impact on our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the only measure we have taken in this House towards national savings. We have done two things: increasing private national savings by superannuation in a very bold way and running a surplus in our budget. That surplus increases to $3.5 billion and $7 billion in subsequent years. That means that the federal government is not drawing on the savings of the nation to fund worthwhile programs. There will be a greater pool of savings available for private investors in which to invest and grow and create more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points which the opposition keeps on making to us on this side of the House&mdash;and which perhaps provoked my earlier remarks&mdash;is that somehow we are being dishonest about the issue of personal tax cuts and that this has offended all Australians. When I walk around my electorate&mdash;it is not the same as Kooyong; I would be the first to admit that, but there are a lot of decent, up-front, hardworking people in it&mdash;I talk to the people about the fact that from next year they will be expected to put a one per cent increase into their superannuation funds and each year after that a further one per cent until it is three per cent. I tell them that this is done under the accord process, and that we believe that because of enterprise agreements and salary increases we are not going to reduce their disposable income, but that rather than getting that in their pockets here today we will be putting it into superannuation. I ask: does it offend you? Do you feel you are being diddled? Are you somehow worse off? Their response is none of those things. They are really pleased that we have as a government grappled with the notion that ordinary people ought to be entitled to superannuation&mdash;</PARA>

So an overwhelming majority belong to the category they think they should belong to.</PARA></TALK.START>

He and I had words yesterday about rubbish and behaving in a way that those opposite cannot justify. But let us leave it at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get on to the issues about this budget. I thought we might just start by touching on the fundamentals. They are pretty interesting when one looks at them. There are a couple of pages in the budget paper which analyse in simple terms what has happened&mdash;total personal taxation is up 13.6 per cent in collections; company tax is up 15.4 per cent in collections; total income tax is up 13.5 per cent in collections; and sales tax is up 22.3 per cent in collections. Of course, very substantial amounts of money are involved in all that: $7 1/2 billion, roughly, in personal tax; $2.3 billion in company tax; $10.3 billion in overall income tax; and $2.5 billion, nearly $2.6 billion in sales tax. This will have a huge impact on the people of Australia&mdash;they have to pay them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point to make is that this is a budget which we were promised would never happen. The last election was all about taxation&mdash;and we do not deny it. The difference between the coalition and the government is that we informed people honestly and up front as to our intentions and offered them a total tax package which did not increase their taxation but only redirected the incidence of taxation. By comparison, we had the Prime Minister standing up saying that he had passed l-a-w, law, and that, under his government, people could get a tax deduction, which he had already passed, if they voted him back into office. There is the evidence of the tax deduction; there is the evidence as to how much you can believe a Keating promise during election time&mdash;tax is up massively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side to the equation is in outlays, and I think they are well worth looking at. Defence outlays in real terms have been reduced again. When we look at public debt interest, one of the most tragic pieces of evidence of this budget analysis is Commonwealth budget outlays. Public debt interest is shown to be $10.077 billion. If we go back up the table, we find that Defence outlays are $9.992 billion&mdash;about $50 million less than public debt outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever one gets into the fine print of the budget, it is probably arguable as to where some of those public debt interest payments are made. As far as I can remember, we get to that situation over a long time. It is a fact that interest outlays are exceeding Defence outlays and they are fast overtaking education outlays&mdash;and that is not a healthy sign. It is my intention to come back to that particular point a little later in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, I thought it might be worth talking for a minute about this debt and the effect it is having on Australians. I did not bring the relevant newspaper article in with me because I might have referred to it before, but there is no doubt that Australia has an embarrassing current account problem. We now have six or nine continuous months where the figure for the current account deficit&mdash;the difference between what Australia sells to the world in all the different categories and what it buys from the world in all those different categories&mdash;has been exceeded in terms of what we have to borrow from the rest of the world to match up with what we sell to the rest of the world. The gap between the two has been in excess of $2 billion a month&mdash;month after month&mdash;and the government tells us that it will probably add up to $27 billion for the year. All the money borrowed adds to a figure of about $160 billion to $170 billion, which is what Australia owes to the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I had a letter recently from a constituent, quoting her sister, who is a good solid Labor supporter, who stated that it has nothing to do with the government's actions and that it is all to do with that nasty private sector of the 1980s. It goes on with all this childish and juvenile logic that suggests that government and government borrowing is not a major contributor. We know from those interest figures I have just quoted and from other documentary evidence that the federal government under Keating economic management owes about $100 billion, up from about $15 billion when Malcolm Fraser left office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we owe the world $160 billion and the Australian government paid back its $100 billion, it is reasonable to argue on the basis of national savings that we would owe the world only $60 billion. This is the silly thing about these arguments. I have forgotten what degree the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) did at university, but apparently there was no bookkeeping or fundamental arithmetic in his education. He was running around with a little campaign. They get these little patches as to what they are to repeat, even though they do not know what they mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that they were boasting that the  federal government does not owe any money overseas, and that is an absolute fact. But anybody who suggests that the federal government can borrow $100 billion of Australia's domestic savings and not have an effect on our overseas debt is plainly stupid. Of course it flows through. It is possible that, for the purpose of lending the government that money, some financial institutions have borrowed overseas. You cannot have governments putting that sort of pressure on domestic savings and expect that not to have an effect on our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, following the Keynesian principle, if you overspend as a government it has an effect on economic growth. As Mr Keynes pointed out, this can be a very positive thing in a recession but a very negative thing when you have economic growth. The government has, or should have, known for some time that economic growth was being achieved in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very silly thing for it to continue to borrow and spend as it did in the last budget and run a deficit when in fact it was out there competing for Australia's savings with the private sector and providing probably, at least in arithmetic terms, about three per cent of the growth it was complaining about. Twelve billion dollars is about three per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that is a simplification, but the simple fact is that when you have an economy in growth you do not stoke it up with government spending just because you want to buy a few votes. Of course, the result was that those opposite had to take out the club of interest rates again. Where did they knock off the economy? It was in the private sector, the very area that does not provide the dole; it provides real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we still have some very foolish economic management. We have all this posturing about savings and the superannuation program. The member for Chifley has left the House, but I noted that in his remarks he was boasting about the massive growth in the number of people who now have superannuation. I do not dispute his figures that there are a lot of people now listed in the superannuation system. I just keep getting letters from people who tell me that the growth of their superannuation funds is negative or that they have disappeared completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have failed to resolve that in any practical and sensible way&mdash;like letting people, particularly in the casual and seasonal work force, which the member for Chifley made some remarks about, get a single superannuation policy and not be forced into award superannuation, which is jealously guarded by certain trade unions. It is going to be the only income they have got left before long, but the simple facts of life are that those people are getting money out of the system at the expense of the workers and, in fact, contributing in many cases to the total erosion of their superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There might be a lot of people now listed and the numbers may be huge in terms of the number of people covered by superannuation. The simple fact is that when we get into it we find that they have not accumulated anything. I know of people with substantial superannuation accumulation who last year got advice that it had reduced in value, not increased in value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what are we being told? The Prime Minister went all the way around Australia telling people of his wonderful example of how somebody was going to get $461,000 out of the policies announced in this budget. When? In 50 years time. You cannot trust a Keating promise from one election day to the next, so why would you trust that particular promise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who are we talking about with that particular figure? We are talking about people on average weekly earnings, but they have to enter the work force in 2002 and, presumably, be 17 or 18 years old at the time. How could they be earning average weekly earnings, which presently stand at about $33,000 a year? What percentage of Australian workers, the people that vote for you, earn $33,000 a year? They do not. They are lucky to earn $20,000 a year. Average weekly earnings is a figure that is just what it says it is, but it is not typical earnings and it is not median earnings. Those people cannot expect anything like that out of this system. We do not know what $461,000 might bring. You might argue that the system will adjust in real terms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can keep quiet because I have told you what you are. You are a rabbit. Let me get back to my business and don't interject. The simple fact of life is that there is going to be very little buying power in some of these huge sums of money. When a house was worth about $7,000, people were being promised $20,000 and $30,000 in superannuation. When they got it, it barely bought the front door of the house, and that is another fact of life. I could take some more time on that issue, but I do not have it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close on another component of where this government says it is going; that is, competition policy. We agree entirely with competition. We accept Professor Hilmer's suggestion that there is $23 billion to be gained and obtained by a proper competition policy, but Professor Hilmer did not say `a competition policy for the states'. Professor Hilmer went as far as to suggest that even such things as the deregulation of the legal system and many of the professional systems and the labour market were necessary to achieve those results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now getting selective competition policy, which says that state enterprise must do all the work, carry all the pain, and the Commonwealth need do nothing about letting Air New Zealand in, need not make up its mind about a sale of the Australian National Line and will give total support to domination by the maritime unions of our waterfront system, notwithstanding the evidence, which is now legion, that that is not working for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my state we have a pretty interesting situation. One of our leading industrialists has come out and tried to put some competition on the waterfront. His name is Len Buckeridge. I am a bit of a gambling man and I am backing Len because I think Len, as usual, will win. What you have to realise about Len Buckeridge is that he is a  self-made man and during his life he has created one of the greatest things for Western Australians in history. He builds about 3,000 houses a year and he manages to sell a typical four-bedroom, two-bathroom house with a dual carport for about $90,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any members representing another state who want to stand up and say that that is a common and typical price for a house in their state can do so, but it is not. I know that from having talked to service personnel. One of their great ambitions is to be transferred to Western Australia, where they just might be able to own a home. Len Buckeridge has done this by using subcontract labour. Those subcontractors are earning $300 a day, and many of them in excess of $1,000 a week. Even if they choose to work only a few days a week, he does not underpay them and he does not exploit them. He has put together a good system for the workers. He has produced vertical integration. And he has not pocketed the profit; he has passed it back to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now he wants to do that on the Western Australian waterfront where, amongst other things, if he were successful he might just make the Western Australian port of Fremantle a very attractive proposition for the unloading of a lot of eastern states freight. That freight could then be transported by rail, which would be quicker and overall would be less expensive. It would create a lot of jobs for people in Western Australia. I have checked it out. Len Buckeridge is not paying his workers any less than the wharfies who are working for Patricks or Conaust. But the people who work for him do a day's work for a day's pay because they are not tied to all the union mumbo jumbo. He has reduced the costs of unloading a shipping operation which loses about $19 million a year. He has produced prices that will save the Western Australian taxpayers $500,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got the Maritime Workers Union&mdash;supported in this parliament by this government&mdash;saying, `You're not allowed to do that.' The unions tried to do this years ago. A fellow called Bill Ethel, who is well known to most people on the other side in the union movement, organised people to run around Perth pushing down the brick walls that had been erected by subcontractor brickies the day before. They were pushing them over. He did not worry about the price of housing for the people, the battlers, the workers of Western Australia; he did not worry about that; he just wanted to get control of bricklayers. Well, Buckeridge beat them. He is one of the great assets to consumers in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the difference between us and those opposite. We know that competition and efficiency lower the cost of living for Australian workers. We can produce a legion of evidence about people being extremely well paid in the subcontract industry. They are not exploited. Some will whinge about it, only because they would like to get twice as much for doing half as much. There is plenty of money to be earned by people giving a day's work in that industry. They are not being exploited, but<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">most particularly Buckeridge is not exploiting his customers. He is passing on those gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we want for Australia. Then it will not be necessary to constantly increase wages, because people will be getting benefits in what they buy.

The coalition wants to attack these values of caring and compassion and, like the Republicans, it wants to substitute greed as the rule of politics. The Republicans in America put forward a contract with America. That contract is admired by the conservatives in this country. But it was not a contract with the whole of America; it was a contract with only part of America&mdash;the wealthy part. It was a contract with those who already earned high incomes. It was a contract to give low income earners a worse deal. It was a contract to give high income earners tax breaks and to slug the poor with higher taxes. It was a contract for lower wages and higher taxes for average income earners. It was a contract with the rich, not a contract with America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same is reflected in the approach of the conservatives in this country.

It has been the values espoused by those people that have been rejected at election after election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions made in this budget will be crucial for the future not only for our older generations but also for our children. We are a medium sized trading nation of only 18 million people. We have great resources. Our greatest resource is our well-educated work force. But, unless we have creative and new policies for the future, we cannot hope to maintain our high standards of living and to protect the values that I spoke about earlier&mdash;values dear to the heart of all Australians: the values of security, of care for our fellow citizens, of mateship and, the cornerstone of our society, the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The centrepiece of this budget that promotes those values and those policies is the superannuation initiative, which will stand alongside universal health care as one of the two great social reforms of Labor governments in the late 20th century and as probably one of Labor's greatest economic reforms alongside the rebuilding of our manufacturing industry. </PARA>

There are two elements of the budget which go to the core of attacking our debt problems: government borrowing and private sector borrowing. These are addressed specifically in the budget by bringing the budget into surplus: a surplus of $718 million this year; and next year a surplus of $3.4 billion, including a structural surplus after taking out the effects of asset sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary aim of this budget is to take the pressure off interest rates by reducing the government's call on savings and particularly by reducing the call on overseas capital. The central purpose of this budget is to fund more of our capital requirements from domestic savings. That is the heart of the superannuation initiative. We need to stimulate savings in our community to provide that capital, to fund the record levels of investment that are building long-term secure jobs in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When the future of Australia was at stake in the Second World War we had a national savings policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a rational world, you would think we should be able to reach agreement on a bipartisan policy for national savings, but instead the coalition has been unable to produce a shred of constructive criticism. All it can play is the same old cracked record of personal diatribe against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The bankruptcy of the opposition's attitudes is recognised far beyond the Labor Party. A report in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> business pages, hardly a platform for the Labor Party, told the story of a presentation made on behalf of the opposition by its superannuation spokesman&mdash;that is the one without the earring&mdash;to the Life Insurance Federation.

<PARA>Nothing could more dramatically illustrate the difference between a government with policies and the rabble of an opposition without them. It has a policy free zone. The opposition has the arrogance of refusing to stand for anything. The opposition is content to play the child's game of blindman's buff. It wants to blindfold the worker, spin the worker around and yell out, `Run, run. The big bad wolf of Labor is coming.' Of course, if it were to do that, workers would hit the wall pretty solidly. Under the coalition there would never be a national income retirement plan for Australians and they could not secure those values that they hold dear to their hearts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the abolition of the deficit, moving the budget into surplus and the major boost to private savings enshrined in the superannuation initiative, the third component of our attack upon the current account problem is the aim to be more competitive and to export more. We must continue, as we have already done, to diversify our exports. We have gone a long way towards the goal of diversifying our exports. Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have grown by 17 per cent a year since 1988. Services exports, another important contributor to the diversification of exports, have grown to 20 per cent of total exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a very substantial structural change in the Australian economy already. We now export something like 20 per cent of our gross domestic product compared with something like 13 per cent when the government came to power. That is an enormous structural change in our economy. We are exporting a lot more of the things that we did not traditionally export as well as exporting more of the things that we did traditionally export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because exports have risen from 13 per cent to 22 per cent of GDP since the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was last an economic spokesman for a government, there has been a tremendous change in our economy&mdash;a change which makes it possible to build on that 40 per cent more competitiveness that we have achieved by having a national superannuation plan. These are important changes for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to continue to build on our competitiveness so we can export more and replace imports, we must continue to have a highly skilled, stable and motivated work force.

<PARA>There are some rogue elements among employers who are happy to see disruption if they can achieve their reactionary end of driving organised labour out of the workplace and denying mainstream Australian workers the right to organise collectively to protect their conditions and wages. The last thing Australia needs at the moment is stupid cowboy employers, such as the fellow in Western Australia, provoking industrial unrest absolutely unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future the coalition sees for industrial relations in this country is the future that people like Mr Buckeridge see, which is a low wage, low skill work force. You look to America and you desire the American outcomes. Labor governments want a high wage, high skill work force, not a low wage, low skill work force. The vision the coalition has is a low skill, low wage work force. Unhappily, people like Mr Buckeridge are being egged on by the opposition spokesman, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who has a very direct connection with that shonky operation going on in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian workers have been prepared over the last decade to accept substantial wage restraint. They have done that to make this economy 40 per cent more competitive and to make sure that we export more. What is their reward for that from the coalition? An attack upon the industrial relations award safety net. The assertion made by the member for Flinders was that they would abolish the no disadvantage test in the existing system and thereby drive out the award system altogether. The whole notion of individual contract, which is continuously supported by the opposition, puts individual workers in the position of accepting a pay cut or the sack. The Jeff Kennett model is the coalition's model. The coalition supports Premier Kennett's recent move in Victoria to cut the minimum wage from $20,000 a year to $17,000 a year&mdash;$60 a week for low paid workers. That is its vision of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what the opposition thinks about these matters but rarely does it say too much in public. Those opposite want to hold back workers' wages, abolish the consensus of the safety net of award conditions and try to justify themselves by pointing to the United States, which is an example that they laud. In the US the minimum wage is derisory. The Republicans, on whom the coalition plans to model its next election campaign, want to abolish even minimal protections workers have in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The American Secretary for Labor, Robert Reich, went out of his way at a meeting of the OECD last week to express his concern at the attack on wages and working conditions in the United States. He stated:</PARA>

<PARA>The demagogues in this country are the members of the coalition. They think they have found some fertile ground but, when we explain to the Australian people the coalition's support for the Jeff Kennett alternative&mdash;abolishing all minimum standards&mdash;and its attack upon fundamental pay for the individual given through overtime, Australian workers and the Australian work force will reject the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mainstream Australians deserve the right of safety net conditions. They deserve to share in the prosperity they create through their wages. After playing their role in holding down inflation during the period of a worldwide recession, what would they get under the coalition? They would get further squeezed because all safety nets, protection and the umpire would be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere is this more evident than in the issue of overtime. The opposition does not believe in minimum conditions. Overtime is historically a vital income supplement for many working Australians. Tall poppies like those on the other side have never depended on overtime. Ordinary workers do, and those opposite have contempt for them. Those who want to attack safety net conditions will have all the support of the coalition. Those Australians who have suffered unemployment in the recession are now seeing a very substantial turnaround, with the creation of something like 560,000 new jobs since the last election and very considerable falls in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is different about this recovery and the current job creation is that this time the long-term unemployed are being picked up in the recovery&mdash;picked up through a set of interventionist Labor government policies directed at ensuring that we do not have intergenerational unemployment in this country and all the social and economic consequences that that would bring to society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not going to dwell on this&mdash;I was going to begin straightaway with the budget&mdash;but this is a related matter. I want to begin with a little story that first may appear to have very little to do with what we have just heard, but I will illustrate why it does in a moment. When I was in the UK about 18 months ago I was told a very interesting little story about something called BSE, or mad cow disease. It sends cattle mad when they get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this disease first emerged in Britain it did not seem to worry consumers very much until one of the infamous British tabloids ran a story about Mrs Smith's cat in some northern English city going mad after it had cleaned up the remainder of a Sunday roast. An instant panic set in, and consumers stopped buying beef. Beef sales dropped by something like 80 per cent. It took 18 months to get back up to normal levels of consumption. During that time mince sales remained largely unaffected. This reflects an extraordinary divorcing from the sort of commonsense approach that we once had and an awareness about what we are really doing and what is really happening. People were apparently unaware that mince was beef, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People operating in a void of real information and with an inadequate understanding of true realities will fall for glib-liners and misleading positions and make bad and unfortunate policy decisions. That has unfortunately become a very real feature of the industrial relations debate in this country. The rigid, highly centralised model we have is undermining wages and conditions for Australian workers. It is keeping them at levels that are simply unnecessarily low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can be further illustrated by referring to a very major export abattoir that I know of in this country. Like so many export abattoirs, it was driven to the brink of financial ruin by poor industrial relations. Those opposite have talked about cowboy managers. What about the cowboys we have seen in recent years in the industry leadership pertaining to the agricultural industries and the value adding industries? This abattoir was taken right to the brink. In fact, I still have my doubts about whether it will make it. This happened purely by virtue&mdash;nobody really disputes this&mdash;of poor industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable members know where that abattoir went to find a manager who understood the necessity for a team game?

About 160 to 170 of you will lose your jobs temporarily, but we'll get them back as soon as we can. We're going to do this together.' Do honourable members know where it had to go?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another Labor member, the member for Chifley (Mr Price), whom I have a great deal of respect for, touched on this subject a little earlier. He said he could not understand why we on this side were always so anti-union because in the private sector work force we have what we claim we wanted anyway: massively declining density of union membership in the private sector work force. That is right. He said it is down to 24 per cent. That is lower than I thought it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member asked why we keep criticising involvement of unions when they are no longer influential. The answer is found in the comments made by John Halfpenny. A little while ago he said something to the effect that it had never occurred to him, that he would never have dreamt, that during his lifetime he would see a situation where union membership declined to such extraordinarily low levels and yet the union movement had more influence than ever before by virtue of having&mdash;I think he used this term&mdash;what amounts to a de facto presence in cabinet. That is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chifley unwittingly highlighted the very thing we are so very critical of: the union movement still having a massive influence and massive capacity to disrupt when it so chooses. I know many union representatives are very responsible, but they still have a grossly undue capacity to influence workplace outcomes at a time when Australians are voting with their feet, when they are saying that they want to be able to do things independently of union representation. What we are saying is quite simple. It is actually pro-choice; it is pro-freedom. It actually fits in with the International Labour Organisation obligations that your mob, Mr Deputy Speaker, keep saying fits in with them in their commitment to freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the mob opposite does not believe in it. We say that every Australian ought to have the absolute right to third party representation in the workplace if they want it; if they do not want it they ought to have the absolute right to not be represented by a third party. What could be more free? What could display a greater commitment to the rights of the individual in a democracy than that position? I throw the challenge out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am as against bad and unfair management and oppressive employers as anybody else. But, until we get a situation where employees and employers actually identify their own future together in a spirit of mutuality and work together to take a place forward, like in the export abattoir I just mentioned, we will not get the better wages and conditions that, in my view, does need. I am quite happy to put on the public record that I believe many Australian workers are underpaid; that they are not receiving decent recompense for difficult, tough working conditions. But, until they are given a real opportunity to work constructively together to work out better ways to do things, I do not believe that that will change. It really means removing the monopoly rights of certain institutions in this country to interfere with genuine enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are times, such as the aftermath of a budget, when the community thinks that all politicians on both sides do is oversell their case. I thought today that I would begin by actually referring to some industry and media commentary on the recent budget. They are, if you like, the third party observers, the people who really know what is happening and who do not have a particular axe to grind&mdash;some do; some do not; some are on our side; some are not. Nonetheless, let us just see what business and industry have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us begin with the Australian Mining Industry Council. You, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, represent a seat where the mining industry is very important, so you might be aware&mdash;I hope you are; I hope that even in the wilds of the Hunter Valley you have heard this&mdash;that Australia has a massive trading deficit. We have a very real problem in this area. The major Australian exporter is the mining industry, so the Australian Mining Industry Council had a great interest in the budget. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The . . . Budget shuffles the cards with real risks for the economy in the longer term. It achieves a surprise surplus, but by way of measures lacking real credibility.</PARA>
<PARA>The Executive Director of the Australian Mining  Industry  Council,  Mr  David Buckingham, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a huge ask to expect outcomes of the kind foreshadowed with asset sales. It is a Budget that also relies unduly on revenue measures&mdash;such as increased company and sales taxes. These measures will be quite counter-productive in their effect.</PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that the government, with all the assembled wit of its advisers, could have seen that. It must have seen that. So why did it institute arrangements that are quite counterproductive? It obviously intended to look for a short-term electoral gain. It is a political budget, a political document, rather than one committed to sound long-term planning. On the proposed increase in the corporate tax rate Mr Buckingham said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will simply discourage business investment which is necessary to increase the level of economic activity and employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>So I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you put that point of view in caucus on behalf of those people who depend on investment in the mining industry in your electorate. The Business Council of Australia ought to know something about employing people and generating prosperity. That is what it is paid to do. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increased revenue measures of $2.4 billion fall primarily on business and are a disguised attack on the present and future incomes of ordinary Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>It also said that growth and jobs will suffer as a result. The Institute of Chartered Accounts, speaking about the sales tax rise on cars&mdash;and this is an interesting one&mdash;said that the increase on a small sedan like the Daewoo would be about $470 and on a family car like a Falcon or a Holden around $1,000. It also said that it is a burden the car industry will have to carry on top of the changes to the FBT arrangements, which had occurred just before, and that it would hurt our international competitiveness and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of hypocrisy spoken by those opposite about the car industry and the environment. That was highlighted to some extent in here today. We were told a couple of years ago that we had to increase the cost of leaded fuel to encourage people to use more unleaded fuel. In reality, the best way to do that is to encourage more Australians to buy new cars. But, at a time when we ought to be encouraging Australians to update their car fleet, at the very time when I would have thought we would have wanted to encourage the Australian car industry, because it is facing a new onslaught from Korea&mdash;the Japan of the 1990s where car exports are concerned&mdash;and it will be very difficult for it in the next few years, and at a time when the car industry desperately needs to get its volumes up on the domestic market if it is to increase exports, what does the government do? It kills off improvements in the motor vehicle industry just as they start to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come back to the environmental aspect. Government members are really a mob of absolute hypocrites where the environment is concerned. Ever since Graham Richardson's days, it has been perfectly obvious that it has been about votes; it has little to do with facts, sound policy or true environmental outcomes. Here is a classic example. I find this quite interesting. According to the Australian Automobile Association, Australia's car fleet is amongst the oldest in the Western world, on a par with Brazil and not far behind Mexico and Greece. </PARA>

It is a typical Labor approach. The minute the government sees an industry start to move again, what does it do? It cuts it off at the knees. The government hates success.

Unfortunately, it rarely has anything to do with the quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go on. What did the newspapers say? I think it is important to see what they said. Sometimes we on this side do not think the newspapers and the media are terribly friendly to us, but let us see what they said.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the situation where the Australian people were conned so that Labor would win the 1993 election.

What was promised by Mr Keating? He said, `I will not put up taxes. What I am promising is not to put up taxes.' But the government has put up taxes by about $9 billion a year. </PARA>

They spoke about the overseas debt, which is about 37 per cent of GDP, but they failed to mention our overseas investments and assets, which are about 31 per cent of GDP.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members have also concentrated on the difference between the headline surplus of $718 million and the measure of the underlying deficit of $8.2 billion, included in statement 7 of the budget documents, as if the government is being deceptive. They have talked about a political job. They are great at talking about government receipts and saying that we are falsifying the figures, but they are not very good at talking about government outlays. The government has made a number of outlays, and opposition members have never asked for them to be excluded from the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have never said that it was wrong to include in the budget outlays the cost of the Snowy Mountains scheme, which is about $800 million; the cost of the Antarctic division allocation, about $40 million; or the cost of the transport infrastructure allocation in the past year, about $210 million. They do not mind that we put that in the budget. In other words, they are quite happy that we include assets we are spending money on in the budget, but they are not particularly happy that we include the assets that we are disposing of. They cannot have it both ways. </PARA>

All these are outlays which opposition members have never objected to being included in the budget figures, yet they object to the inclusion of receipts if they involve assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are being quite hypocritical. They are telling only half the story when talking about the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The truth is that we have also made some major expenditure savings. It ought to be mentioned that, using the traditional measure, the budget result for 1995-96 is a surplus of $718 million. By any measure, there is a substantial turnaround in the budget deficit for 1995-96. By any measure, the budget will be in surplus in 1997-98 and in substantial surplus in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure savings have been achieved in employment, education and training. That is partly due to the success of the government's Working Nation program. In 1994-95 we had an estimated appropriation of $3.2 billion, with an estimated expenditure of $2.8 billion. We have achieved savings of about $300 million in labour market training and assistance. We have achieved this because we are getting people back to work more quickly than we anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment level has dropped and this has meant savings. It has meant that we have not had to keep training and labour market programs at the level that we had. That is a truth that ought to be known. It is being revealed now to people as we tell those in our electorates about the budget. Members of the government&mdash;and I hope the Independents&mdash;have been telling people what is happening; that is, the labour market training and assistance programs are working. </PARA>

The old RED scheme was improved on by the wage pause scheme&mdash;other than the fact that it was a wage pause. The wage pause scheme was improved on by the community employment program. The community employment program was vastly improved on by the current labour market training and assistance programs. Even if we get only a 20 or 30 per cent dividend, we are getting results and getting people off unemployment benefits and into the work force. Looking at it from a purely economic point of view, those people are paying taxes. There have been major gains. </PARA>

They do not always tell the story that we in Australia have other important likes apart from higher wages. For instance, we like a reasonable lifestyle. This became evident to me again last week when I was in Cooma and visited a local restaurant. I met an Italian who came out during the Snowy Mountains scheme and married a lady from Indonesia. They were both from countries with very hard working people. He said, `We have decided that we will have one day off a week&mdash;Tuesdays&mdash;so that we will work six days out of seven. We are adapting to the Australian lifestyle, and it is something that we appreciate. We don't want to die young. We have children to look after, and we think it is better for our children if we put some time in with them, because they have to put up with us working in the restaurant day and night.' They are people who have selected our lifestyle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to get agreement from the  honourable member for O'Connor on that matter. While I am talking about lifestyle, I mention the expenditure of $13 million over four years to reduce the incidence of youth suicide. I believe we have given far too little attention to young people and their needs. We give quite a lot of attention to older people, but we do not think about young people nearly enough and the trauma that young people are suffering out there today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy for older people to criticise young people and say, `They need to pull their socks up. It was much more difficult in my time, yet we were able to amuse ourselves. We weren't bored.' What people do not realise is the trauma that young people face. However, when I left work my problem was working out which job I would take. I had a choice of jobs. When young people leave work today, their problem is actually finding a job. This is due to technological changes. A lot of families have two people working and a lot of families have no-one working. There is a challenge for young people that we have to meet. The drop in our unemployment rate is commendable, but we need to do more. I applaud this funding over four years for research and development of a program which deals with youth suicide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far too little is being done not only for young people but also for families. In the enormous restructuring I have been very surprised. I have appointed a student inturn, Gerry Cirulli. He is a mature age student who has been doing work for me on the effect on families of restructuring in the timber industry and the threat that is imposed by indecisiveness by governments at both levels and by the prolongation of decisions relating to entry into logging areas. I am going to release these findings in the next few weeks. The report indicates that very little work has been done in Australia and worldwide on the effect on families of restructuring and uncertainty relating to their employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking forward to that report. We need to talk about what happens in families and in the home. What happens when people suddenly feel threatened about mortgage repayments; when women have to go out, as they do in the timber industry, and guard equipment when the male is at home; and when children are uncertain because their parents are often out either lobbying governments or guarding equipment from sabotage, as has happened in our own forests in the south-east region of New South Wales? This puts uncertainty into the family and it also creates divisiveness. It can discourage cooperation within the family. It can create problems at school. It can result in family breakdown. There are a lot of threats on families, I believe, at the moment through uncertainty in the timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the fact that there is a proposal by government to bring more certainty back into the timber industry. Just recently, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) released a wood and paper industries strategy which aims to cut through this forest impasse. The strategy is to establish a framework to support a vibrant, value adding industry based on ecologically sustainable forests and plantations. There are starkly different views across the community about the management and use of our forests, especially our native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope this report will lead to action which will bring more certainty into the forest industry and land management as a state and a territory responsibility. But it is clear that the community&mdash;not just environmentalists but also people in the forest industry&mdash;is looking to the Commonwealth to take a leadership role in breaking the impasse that exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic premise of the discussion paper is that it is possible and desirable to build strong, value adding wood and paper industries while protecting the high conservation values of our native forests. I support that and I look forward to its implementation. I look forward to early action so that we can have assessments and a combined scoping study with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy working together so that we do not have the fiasco of last year where we had different departments coming in at different times and material was not available to government until new licences were almost needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Licence needs to be by region, not by coupes. I appreciate that governments have had a lot of problems in getting together the state and federal policies, particularly in New South Wales where we have recently had a change in government. We have had real problems in developing coordinated action by government. There is no excuse for that continuing. We must have licensing by regions so that the state and federal government can get together and say, `Here is our region. We believe you can take X amount of tonnes in woodchipping for export. Here is where we propose that people should be allowed to go in.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also requires honesty. It is clear now that, when you are dealing with some of the environmental groups, you have people that have shifting goalposts, people who can never be pinned down. One of our Green senators from Western Australia said, `No, I'm not in favour of plantations. That's monoculture.' What would that do to our country, to our wheat farms, to our sheep farms, to our pine plantations if we wiped off monoculture like that? You cannot do it unless you are about pretty severe negative growth. We cannot accept that sort of argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major parties have learnt&mdash;if they have not, they need to learn&mdash;that we have to look at the truth. We are not going to have successful industries, taking into account the important environmental concerns, unless we face the truth about those industries. The truth about the forest industry is that we can have an integrated logging system which includes sawmilling, which includes adding value to that sawmill timber, and which includes woodchipping, preferably adding value here in Australia with pulp mills. This means you face the truth about the environmental concerns about the pulp mill, but you can have pulp mills that are environmentally sensitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the export of woodchips is part of a very important relationship that we have with Japan if we do not value add in Australia. We have a $4 billion trade surplus with Japan&mdash;it buys $4 billion more from us than we do from it. The woodchip industry is an important part of that trade relationship. I think it is wrong for us to condemn woodchipping for export when it is profitable for the forest industry. It would certainly be more preferable if we could add value in Australia. I believe that if we can develop our sustainable forest industries and add value in Australia then the primary industry part of this budget will bring successful results. </PARA>

This government's 13th budget is an example where Labor has, more than ever before, let this great country down.

That is really what Labor is starting to do to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are we seeing the damage that is being done to our economy, but we are seeing the damage that is being done to our sovereignty. I will address a couple of those issues. In relation to our sovereignty, I find it fascinating the way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seems to think that when he travels overseas he can take attention off his own domestic failings by telling overseas leaders what they can do in their countries. He has just been to Japan where he told the Japanese how to run their economy. He tells the Germans how to design cities. One wonders whether he will go to Egypt and tell them how to build pyramids or whether he will go to South Africa and tell them how to play rugby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister goes overseas he also seems to take great pleasure in denigrating his own country. He cannot speak about the Australian flag when he is overseas because he apparently feels that he has to denigrate it. One only has to look at television reports to see the astounded looks on the faces of some foreign leaders when he is in their countries and starts to attack one of our icons or to run domestic issues. If the Prime Minister wants us to gain independence and be a republic, obviously we need a stronger nation not a weaker nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at what has happened to this nation under Labor, there is one thing that really stands out&mdash;that is, the frightening rise in foreign debt. We have heard some lame excuses from members of the Labor Party for the poor level of Australian investment overseas. What they overlook is that the foreign debt keeps rising. The current account deficit has been over $2 billion month after month and the government keeps saying, `It's not quite as bad as we thought. It was not $3 billion.' The $27 billion deficit that the government expects this year amounts to a debt of $1,500 for every man, women and child in Australia. If we look at the forecast for next year, what do we find? We will have a deficit of another $27 billion. The government says that it is a record, but it has been stabilised. That means another $1,500 debt for every man, woman and child in Australia. That is some record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what will happen if we keep running up debts year after year. A good example is what Labor did in my home state of Victoria. The state is in dire trouble because debts were run up to the point where the government had to sell the State Bank. Many people have reminded me recently that you can never trust Labor with money. That sure is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should look at the way the financial markets of the world are rating our performance. We only have to look at what is happening to the Australian dollar. I find these figures quite frightening. In terms of the trade-weighted index the dollar is at an all-time low. This year we find that the Australian dollar has fallen by 22.8 per cent against the Japanese yen. Remembering that Japan is our No. 1 trading partner, this is a very significant point. We find that against the German mark the dollar has fallen by 17.3 per cent and against the New Zealand dollar it has fallen by 11 per cent. The Labor Party seems to like to belittle New Zealand, but it must be doing something right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find that the dollar has fallen by 10.6 per cent against the Korean won. Korea is our second biggest trading partner, having overtaken the United States. Against the pound the dollar has fallen by 9.6 per cent and against the US dollar it has fallen by 7.6 per cent. It is clear that, when the Prime Minister talks about trying to build up sovereignty, what he is in fact doing is undermining it because he is not running the economy properly. This budget is just another example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister desperately looks for his place in history he may well find one, but I do not think it is going to be the one that he wants. He will be known as the man who single-handedly, and more than any other Prime Minister this century, has set about running Australia down and making it a second-rate nation by sacrificing our economic sovereignty. When we talk about trying to build up the sovereignty of this country, we look at the economy and we find that we have failed the real test. In question time on the 11th of this month, the Prime Minister made an extraordinary statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When every member of this House has left it and been replaced by somebody else, the thing in Tuesday night's budget that will be there supporting the country will be the changes to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>On occasions government members have tried to make something out of this, but he is talking decades ahead. We know that the Prime Minister could not even keep a promise of three years ago and yet he is expecting us to believe that decades ahead somehow this magical promise will be fulfilled. If we look at the whole question of why this sudden shift to big promises in relation to superannuation and government funding for superannuation, we find that it is a smokescreen to hide the fact that the l-a-w tax cuts have completely vanished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to remind all honourable members, before the last election the Prime Minister told the people of Australia, `I am not going to make promises about tax cuts because they are law. We have passed them through both houses of the parliament. They are law.' After the election, what did he do? He made another law which reversed the first one. No wonder there is such cynicism in the community. No wonder people do not trust this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look closely at some of the big figures on superannuation that have rolled off the Prime Minister's tongue&mdash;such as over $400,000 and so on for retirement benefits&mdash;and when we look at the small print, we find that this benefit may be available to the grandchildren of the current members of this chamber when they are looking at retirement. A package of that size will not be available for anyone other than those who start work after the year 2000 and work for 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come back to what it means for people in the work force today. The average 40-year-old worker who is earning $600 a week and contributing three per cent of his salary to the government on a dollar for dollar subsidy, plus his employer's contribution, will retire on $5,616 per annum, or $108 per week, in super. That is what the Prime Minister is really promising people in that age group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at someone who is a bit younger, say, a 30-year-old in the same situation. He will get 33 per cent of his wages, or $10,296 per year. Someone who is 50 will only get seven per cent of his average income, or $2,184 per annum&mdash;$42 per week. That is the sort of level of superannuation that will be available for people who are currently in the work force. It is a far cry from the sorts of figures that the Prime Minister bandies around as though some magic wand will be there for everyone. It will not be there for everyone; it will be there for our grandchildren. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great con in this budget is the supposed balanced budget. Much has been said about the fact that these will be far bigger asset sales than have ever been undertaken by this government. Again, those proposed sales are far greater than what this government was able to achieve when it promised to do the same thing in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax increases are what I think the government has been desperately trying to hide. I have spoken about the fact that the l-a-w tax cuts have now vanished. But we find that overall an additional $9 billion will be collected by the government through tax in the coming year. Fuel levies are going to go up by another $1 1/2 billion, which, again, will hit transport. Transport is one of our most important areas in trade, yet the government keeps taxing it. Sales taxes are going to increase, including sales tax on cars, which will raise $2.1 billion. Company tax is going to go up about nine per cent from 33c to 36c in the dollar. As I have mentioned, the promised l-a-w tax cuts have now vanished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget, more than any other, has vanished very quickly as the public, the media and people&mdash;particularly those in the business community&mdash;have realised just how bad it really is. In fact, this budget has not even had a honeymoon period. It was rejected straightaway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to a couple of these taxes and look at a simple example of sales tax. Sales tax is going to hurt small business. On 10 May, the Prime Minister made an absolutely amazing statement about small business. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if they're feeling the pinch they ought to say, `small business is not for me'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because it's never going to get any better. This is as good as it ever gets.</PARA>
<PARA>That reminds me of a former Labor Prime Minister who said, `You have never had it better.' He did not last very long, maybe that is the message here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example of what a sales tax increase is going to do to a small business operator in my electorate, and this is typical of many small battling business owners. One of my constituents currently runs a small manufacturing business. The only way he can remain competitive is to stay below the threshold exemption for sales tax. In other words, he does not have to pay any. Currently, the sales tax on the product that he manufactures is 11 per cent. On 1 July it increases to 12 per cent, but the threshold remains the same. That means that the tax-free threshold, from the point of view of production, drops from $91,000 to $83,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the demand for his product has doubled, he was going to increase his work force and put on two people. He was on the verge of employing them but because of the threshold he is going to drop that idea. So two people are on the dole who otherwise would have been employed, which is another example of what tax increases mean in terms of employment. It is all very well for ministers to come in here and say, `Tax increases don't affect people.' Of course they do, and that is a simple, clear-cut example of a businessman in my area who is going to cut back on his production because of the tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what is going to happen with building materials. Every Australian's dream is to own a home.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about the increased sales tax on cars, it was a funny thing for the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to come in here today and say that the government only took the tax off while there was the recession&mdash;the recession we had to have&mdash;and now it was putting the tax up. The fact remains that Australia has one of the oldest car fleets in the OECD. The average age of cars is around 12 years. If the government wants to encourage people to upgrade their cars and use lead-free petrol, it should not be putting the price of cars out of the reach of ordinary Australians. It is pretty obvious that Australians are finding it difficult to replace their cars now, without this increase in cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another way the government is hitting the battlers is through the nice little slug coming in on fuel that will affect a number of people, including the railways. The removal of excise on certain light fuels in the budget will mean an additional $80 million tax on country railways. No doubt the government thinks that, by talking about the standard gauge link between Adelaide and Melbourne, it can cover that fact up. The point is that people in the country particularly who rely on rail for their transport are going to find that the costs are going to rise. Yet again, it illustrates a government that is really not that concerned about looking after people in country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at other areas in the transport field where the government has failed to deliver, it is again very illustrative of the fact that the government is no longer governing for all people but for its mates. Since we hear so much about the government's support for the unions, what better example than the scandalous story of the waterfront. If we look at the so-called reform on the waterfront, we find that the government has committed over $200 million of taxpayers' money to reform it and there has been a matching levy on all users of the waterfront. So over $430 million has been spent. Yet, since that reform, the performance of our waterfront has been slipping back. Why? Because the union there is starting to get back into its bad old habits and no-one is going to do anything about it. Frankly, this is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point about the extraordinary level of our indebtedness and the fact that we are running into the red by over $2 billion a month. We are expecting a current account deficit of $27 billion. In looking at one of the key areas that we could reform to make Australia more productive so we could trade our way out of some of these problems, and in looking at what has happened on the waterfront, we find that in Contship's most recent rating of 46 ports Sydney has dropped from 24th to 31st on that list, and Melbourne has gone from 28th to 37th. The productivity of Melbourne is now only 40 per cent of that of Antwerp and 66 per cent of that of Auckland&mdash;not a very pretty picture. I think it really is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at this budget, we will see that it is going to do nothing for this country, but it will be noted for two things: first of all, for being the fudge-it budget, as it has been so aptly named; and, secondly, how quickly it has been dismissed by informed people throughout the community as not doing anything worth while to help this country get back on its feet. Clearly, it shows just how tired this government is. It shows how the time has come for a change in government. I think this budget must surely be the last that Labor has the opportunity to deliver in this decade. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Much as I respect the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), after listening to his contribution over the past 15 to 20 minutes, I am disappointed that he runs out the same old cliches, the same old excuses, the same slogans, that the opposition has lived on for so many years. I have to spend some of my time now rebutting the same old cliches. It is like the opposition has learnt a song but can never forget it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the tax cuts were legislated prior to the last election, the unanimous call from the opposition was: `You cannot afford it; you shouldn't be doing it.' The opposition has been saying the same thing ever since&mdash;`You cannot afford it; you shouldn't be doing it. You shouldn't give people those tax cuts.' Even now when the tax cuts and the benefits are coming through in superannuation, which I will deal with a little later, we get the same old thing&mdash;`We wouldn't do it, but you shouldn't do it either.' Over and over we get that repetition. One day we will hear something constructive. One day we will hear something that is thought through rather than hearing the same old repetition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one could possibly forget the great catchcry of the 1977 election campaign in all of those TV commercials and newspaper ads&mdash;the fistful of dollars, the tax cuts that disappeared six weeks after the election was won by those opposite. This was when the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer. Please, do not belabour us with claims that you have some credibility. You do not have credibility on this issue. Your record speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You come in here whingeing because the Australian work force is going to get access to greater superannuation benefits and a decent sort of retirement income because this government is addressing that issue of retirement income through superannuation. If you do not like it, just say that you do not want people to have superannuation, because that really fits in with the policy the conservatives have had year after year after year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to government in 1983, less than 40 per cent of Australians had access to superannuation. Today, just under 90 per cent of Australians have access to superannuation. If one looks at the opposition policy&mdash;the little bit of it that we can see that seeps out between the cracks&mdash;we see that it is for optional superannuation, which takes us back to the old system that we had when the opposition was in government previously and in the decades before that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the great problem that we have to overcome in this nation&mdash;that is, to increase private saving. One cannot have legitimacy and credibility and talk about foreign debt and living off the savings of people abroad on the one hand and oppose measures that are going to substantially improve the level of private saving in this country on the other. The government's moves in respect of superannuation have those two objectives: the first is to generate a substantial increase in private saving in this nation; and the second is for that private saving to then be utilised to develop Australia's industry, develop our own plant and equipment, provide our own investment capital, so that the reliance on private firms and private sector borrowing abroad can be reduced. The great bulk of national debt abroad that is outstanding is not government debt&mdash;certainly not debt from this government&mdash;it is private sector debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the overall attitude of the opposition to taxation, superannuation and savings, it is totally transparent. It just does not have credibility. I find it very difficult to listen to the member for Wannon, who is usually much more researched and more factual in what he has to say in this place than he has been just now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He complains about the increases in indirect tax, as I have heard previous opposition speakers in this budget debate comment on, politely forgetting what coalition policy was at the last election. They can carry on and say, `Yes, we were going to reduce that tax, get rid of that one; we were going to bring in a 15 per cent GST and prosperity would reign forever.' The reaction was that people did not believe you. They did not believe you then; they do not believe you now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not believe it yourselves really. One of the fascinating things in the last parliament was watching the faces on the other side when out the front leader Hewson would say, `All those in favour of GST.' You were mutinous over there. One could see that you did not really believe it, but the leader was saying it, and he ought to know because he was a good economist, but he was not really a politician. So those behind all sat there watching. They went like lemmings to the precipice. That is what happened. But the reality is that the people of this country will not accept that kind of measure. No matter how you whinge now about some changes that have occurred in indirect tax, they pale into insignificance in comparison to what was being proposed by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the budget was brought down, I have also seen the organised clamour by the opposition and some of its agents, in respect of small business, and heard how badly done by small business has been in respect of the increase in company tax from 33c to 36c. One needs to put this in perspective. When we came into government the company tax rate was 46c in the dollar and there was double taxation of dividends, which had a horrendous impact&mdash;it had been there for decades under previous conservative governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We increased the corporate rate to 49c, then cut it back to 39 per cent and then reduced it further to 33c. Then, of enormous benefit to companies, in the mid-1980s we abolished the double taxation of dividends. That has been of enormous benefit to business in this country. It is never recognised, never adverted to by those who sit opposite&mdash;they probably do not understand it&mdash;but certainly is adverted to by most businesses when they look at budgets and talk about measures that have been achieved by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come back to small business. About 80 per cent of small businesses are not companies, so the change in the company tax rate does not affect them. Yet that is the line being peddled out there by those opposite. The most important issue for small business is how to improve and maintain sales. What do you need to improve sales? You need a growing economy. What have we got under this government&mdash;a growing economy. From the middle of last year we heard from those opposite, `The economy is growing too fast; there's going to be inflation; there's going to be a boom and bust cycle again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy has steadied down due to the measures taken by the government. What we are about in this budget is maintaining a rate of growth that can be accommodated in this country without inflationary pressures, that at the same time generates jobs and creates a climate in which the pressure for further increases in interest rates recedes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very much what is being achieved and has resulted in the days since the budget was presented on the 9th of this month. Interest rates have dropped. There is an expectation that the economy is settling down. Recent figures are pointing to that, and it is clear from the business sector that that is what is happening. The most important issue after sales for small business is lower interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is utter hypocrisy to be running around the country clamouring to small business how terrible it is that the company tax rate is up. Four out of five small businesses do not pay company tax; they are not companies. The opposition says that inflation will go up. The inflation rate is forecast to be 2 1/2 to three per cent over the cycle. We have had 2 1/2 to three per cent inflation for the last three years&mdash;the longest period in more than 20 years that there has been such stability in the inflation rate. Interest rates have gone down&mdash;not up. If one is genuinely looking to assist small business we need a steady growth in the economy, lower interest rates, a lower rate of inflation and steady growth in employment. From that growth in employment comes the additional demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite refer to a $9 billion increase in tax revenue next year. If we have more people joining the work force, there are more people paying tax. A major contribution to that increase comes from the fact that there are more people at work and able to pay tax. So I have great difficulty with some of the comments we hear from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment is also made that the increase in the excise on light diesel fuel is taking extra money from users of that form of energy. If you look through the budget papers you will find that distorted demand developed for that quality diesel. People were previously using a heavier form of diesel which carried a higher excise rate. Because there was a difference in the rates there was a distortion in demand and demand just shifted across so users could avoid the higher excise rate. It is not a matter of suddenly increasing the rate; it is really restoring the status quo. I know that there will be some changes in it but you cannot compare one without the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go back to the old catchcry of `the waterfront, the waterfront, the waterfront'. How many times do we have to hear about the waterfront? Maybe some day someone on the other side will actually go down to the waterfront and see what happens, see how things work, see how those 25-year-old cranes function and how fast they can lift up. Maybe one day they might even try driving one of those cranes themselves, and see if they can drive it faster or if they can move the truck faster, or if they can drop the container onto the truck faster. I doubt whether they will do it. We will be back here again hearing, `the waterfront, the waterfront, the waterfront'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is $1 billion in potential savings to be made by businesses in moving their products, their goods, to and from the waterfront. It has nothing to do with members of the Waterside Workers Federation, who are now the Maritime Union of Australia. It has nothing to do with government regulation or decisions by this government. It has all to do with the competence of business management. Show me a transport decision maker in any firm&mdash;importer or exporter&mdash;who is on the board. The people who make decisions about despatching goods and receiving goods are well down the totem pole. It is usually the purchase clerk or the dispatch clerk. There is a host of inefficiencies, mismatches and a lack of coordination all along the chain, from the warehouse to the wharf and return, from shipside to warehouse destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not help industry or business to become more competitive by encouraging people to sling around slogans and chants. If the major firms are having difficulties with waterfront services, they are privately owned stevedoring firms. It is not just a matter of members of the union. The work force has virtually been halved. We have gone into record levels of imports compared to when the waterfront reforms were made. Yet we hear the same old cry. One issue that has been deliberately avoided in all of the shouting and screaming that has come from sectors of industry and from the opposition is that when the changes and reductions in numbers were made on the waterfront the demand and the container throughput were considerably less than what they are today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You cannot have it both ways. You cannot halve the work force and increase the throughput of containers and say, `We have not improved anything'. Something has got better. When we look at the performance indicators that came out of the committee of this parliament, the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, and the indicators prepared by the Bureau of Transport Economics, we see that there has been improvement. If there is something happening at the moment, the way to go about it is to examine it and get people together, identify the problem and develop the solutions&mdash;not hark back to the old slogans of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined to an extent the key objectives of the budget. They are to maintain growth in the economy, to reduce the pressure for further increases in interest rates, to maintain a low rate of inflation and to maintain growth in employment. Generally that is happening as a result of the budget that has been introduced. That will proceed. I am very confident about that. In the past year we have had a growth rate in employment, which looks like concluding at the end of next month, of about 4 3/4 per cent. We are looking to a growth rate in the coming year of about 3 3/4 per cent. We are looking to a growth in the number of jobs, or percentage rate increase, of around three per cent. The inflation rate I mentioned is 2 1/2 to three per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to be said in this place is that we promised at the last election that we would create 500,000 new jobs in the life of this parliament. We have created 550,000 new jobs already. The unemployment rate is down to 8.3 per cent. We have also seen a variation in the participation rate, and that has an impact on the unemployment rate. There has been a considerable increase in employment. As we said in the Working Nation statement of last year, we were going to give preference to the long-term unemployed. There has been a reduction of 25 per cent in the number of long-term unemployed. The provisions in this budget under the Department of Employment, Education and Training will continue to give that preference and continue to reduce the number of long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term unemployed are the people who have been suffering most in this period of high unemployment. They are the people who have the greatest difficulty in getting back into the work force. That is why I am so pleased, particularly in my own region of the Hunter, that we see people getting back into the work force, getting a start, getting some current skills, getting some independence and getting back that dignity and freedom that come with having real work. It is not an easy job and it is not all going to be done rapidly. The important thing is that it is happening and continuing to flow through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part that you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, are both aware of is the development of regionalism by this government. I am pleased that there seems to be recognition from state governments that regionalism, led by the federal government, is something to be a partner of and not something to be afraid of. Whereas in the past we saw state governments opposed to regionalism, now my observation is that the state governments are more receptive of regionalism and more likely to participate in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Hunter we have developed the Hunter Regional Development Organisation. We have had a number of regional organisations over the years, the first one dating back to the floods in Maitland in 1955&mdash;the Hunter Valley Research Foundation. In the years since, various organisations have been developed, with differing purposes and at differing times. They all see themselves as important. They all see themselves as having a prime function in the regional economy. What I am so pleased about in regard to the development of the Hunter Regional Development Organisation is that we have brought together at a most senior level, at chief executive officer level and at chairperson level, those organisations. They are all marching in the one direction for the first time in the history of our region. It does not matter how fast they are marching; the important thing is that we are all going in the one direction, sharing in and developing a regional approach to the economy of which we are all part. That development is very special to me and very special to the people of our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one last matter I will mention in the time available to me. I pay tribute to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). He brought the legislation through this parliament in the latter part of the last financial year that gave merchant mariners who served in World War II access to the same benefits as defence personnel. That is something he has been praised for right across Australia. But we also must praise former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys), and his successor, Senator Faulkner, as the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, for giving recognition to the need there. </PARA>

They are tired of the gloom and doom so evident in recent years and which seems to have been overcome, but only with five minutes of sunlight&mdash;and we are going back into the doom and gloom again. They are tired of that talk. They are tired of being taken for granted by this government&mdash;and really they are tired of this government.

I also asked my constituents that, if they were to spend 30 minutes with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), what they would talk about. Each of them has suggested that they would like to talk about his retirement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in my electorate are very concerned about this particular budget. The budget is a typical example of the corrupt way this Labor Party will do whatever it takes to hold on to power. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might recall former Senator Richardson talking about `whatever it takes'. There are no truer words being used when speaking about and reviewing this particular budget. There are three points I would raise which will identify how corrupt this government is about drawing up this very shonky budget&mdash;in particular `whatever it takes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget delivers nothing but delusion in a lot of areas, and delusion so great that Harry Houdini&mdash;you might recall that movie; I saw it just recently&mdash;would be proud. The first point I would talk about is whether we are in debt or in surplus. Some of the government speakers have waxed lyrical about this great achievement&mdash;a surplus. In fact, they have suggested that we have a surplus of $718 million, or thereabouts. The Prime Minister has made a point about the significance of this figure; he has said, `It's great, the Labor Party's back on track again, and we're now winning; we're winning, we are in surplus'&mdash;but are we really?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we observe the budget papers, we can see that the government has tried to con the people of Australia again. If we turn to page 7.3 of Budget Paper No. 1, we can see the truth being revealed. On this page we can see that the great con has been exposed. According to ABS figures, the actual figure&mdash;that is the true, the real figure; the most important figure, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister have said&mdash;is an $8.232 billion deficit. That is a deficit, not a surplus. Hasn't the Prime Minister bragged about a surplus? But this actually says a deficit. Haven't all the other speakers raved about this particular surplus? How come there is a real deficit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this, I think, is that we have had some creative accounting by the Treasurer. I think the Treasurer should do my tax refund this year because then I would get a refund. He has virtually done the impossible with some creative accounting. He has turned a deficit into a surplus. The amusing thing about this fact&mdash;that is, turning a deficit into a surplus&mdash;is that a lot of people on his side of politics and his back bench actually believe what he says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do not think it is the Treasurer. I think there is a bit of a conspiracy theory here.

Total collections are $124.5 billion. So there is a bit of a deficit there. We are talking about a surplus, but we are seeing that we are collecting less than we are spending.

Would you retire some debt and reduce your overhead that way, or would you spend it on the gro ceries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people would retire their debts, particularly the mortgage, but the government is actually spending the money on the groceries. It is actually spending it on expenditure. That is not to say we should not sell our assets, but the profit we make really should be used to retire debt, not to pay for the way we live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To gain a book surplus this year, we sold assets to cover our operational costs. Any small businessman would know this, but the trouble is that business is very lacking from those on the front bench, and even the second bench, of those opposite. They do not have the experience in business to understand what it means when you spend more than you actually collect. The budget is shonky because the figures just do not add up. A deficit is a deficit no matter how you try to hide it, and hide it the government has really tried to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I wish to discuss is the myth about the Labor Party. That so-called caring, sharing institution is so caring that it will provide tax reductions and even tighten up expenditure until it really hurts. That is basically what it said it was going to do in this budget, all for the sake of its own constituency, the true believers. They are probably called the few believers now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaker after speaker for the government, and those interjecting, probably believe this particular bit of rhetoric. They have tried to convince us that they are responsible and that they are working hard to reduce tax and reduce tax on their own constituency and the needy, et cetera. How can this be? Those in the Labor Party try to tell us that they are a low taxing party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is stretching credibility to the limit to suggest that they are a low taxing party, because the figures in the budget just do not add up. For instance, the Medicare levy, which is a tax, is going up 7.5 per cent. Building products are now to be rated at 12 per cent for wholesale sales tax. Sales tax on cars has shot up 33 per cent. Company tax is up nine per cent. In fact, revenue will increase a staggering $2.4 billion. That sounds like a tax hike, yet those opposite seem to fall at the feet of the emperor and try to convince the Australian people that they can expect some tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the Australian people expect tax cuts when taxes are going up? No-one really believes this claim of l-a-w tax cuts, least of all those who voted for this party at the last election in marginal seats currently held by Labor. I suggest to those opposite that they should consider the marginal seats held by them and perhaps start having some farewell parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer says that we are a low tax country within our region. This is truly a ridiculous claim. Only Japan, the country that Dr Paul tried to give advice to recently, is of similar taxing standards. All other countries, the so-called tigers like South Korea, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia Philippines and New Zealand, have less company tax than does Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wait for a speaker opposite to explain how we can remain competitive within these markets when such high tax rates still exist. They are unable to because they come from a non-business background, a non-wealth creating background, and they cannot really seriously know how to create a dollar out in the market. It is a joke really, but it should not be a joke because it is very serious. The Australian community is beginning to wake up to the bluster of those opposite. The Labor Party is a high taxing party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I will talk about concerns the real achievements of this government, so proudly bragging that it is working for the community and that it has all these policies that are helping the community. Where is the social consciousness of those opposite? They always say that they have it, but where is it, in fact? Let us look at some of the facts concerning the community at the moment, the constituency that they say they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average duration of unemployment at the start of this parliament was 57.5 weeks. This compares with 32.9 weeks that prevailed when the Labor Party first came to power. The facts suggest that it is harder to get a job under Labor now than it was when it first came to power. Where in this budget is this issue addressed? It does suggest that expenditure on training programs has been reduced. Of course, employers have been slugged with tax increases which will ultimately affect their prospects of employing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some more facts to ponder are that, after 10 years of Labor being in power, we now have the startling figure of one in 10 Australian families with both parents out of work. Nineteen per cent&mdash;that is, over 700,000&mdash;of Australian children under the age of 15 live in a family in a household with no breadwinner. Twenty-five per cent of Australian families has no working member. Where are the benefits in the budget for these families? We should not forget that sales tax will rise by between three per cent and nine per cent on 1 July of this year as a result of the Dawkins horror budget of 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some more figures which cannot be ignored are that the number of so-called traditional families in the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. The number of children who are members of welfare dependent families rose a staggering 166 per cent to 1.6 million in that same period. One hundred and six million Australian children are in welfare dependent families. Surely this is totally unacceptable in a wealthy country like Australia. But it does confirm that under this government the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One in eight families falls below the poverty line. Poverty is increasing in almost every population group except the aged. Over two million Australians now live below the poverty line. Of all Australian families living in poverty, one half comes from traditional `nuclear' families. Forty-four per cent of Australia's single parent families live in poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking inflation into account, one in 10 earners have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since Labor took office. Over the same period, real wages for the bottom 10 per cent have fallen by five per cent. The top 20 per cent of income earners get 42 per cent of total earnings. The bottom 20 per cent get 5.4 per cent of total earnings. This budget does not address these particular issues, so where is the great Labor Party and its caring attitude for the Australian people in this budget? The fact is that this budget is a sham. It is pitched to an already cynical electorate for the next election, but it will not work, certainly not in marginal seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give another example. The Labor Party says say here in this social security aspect that it is going to increase rent assistance by $5 per fortnight for families with children. That is a great initiative. It is actually going to cost outlays of $8.58 million. At the same time, the government increased rent assistance thresholds by $5 per fortnight. In the first year of operation, it will outlay $1.7 million, which is not too bad. We are actually outlaying it, so it is not bad. But in 1996-97 we actually win $2.6 million; in 1997-98, $4.4 million; and in 1998-99, $4.7 million. Those opposite are basically saying that they are going to increase rent assistance by $5 for families&mdash;$5 does not buy a hamburger&mdash;but at the same time they are increasing thresholds and they are actually going to increase their income over the next couple of years. So this budget is really a bit of a sham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has fudged figures. The evidence for this is the rubbish about the surplus and, in particular, the allocations of expenditure on the budget rent-a-car process of selling off the fleet. The budget is a high taxing budget. The evidence for this is the increases in taxes and the greatest collection of taxes since Gough Whitlam. The budget does nothing for the real social issues within the community. The evidence is that there is no mention of any substance at all within the budget in relation to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government really is on its last legs. Yes, IT is important; yes, APEC is important; and, yes, trading with our Asian neighbours is important&mdash;I think the government should consider the Indian Ocean region as well, in particular, India&mdash;but so, too, are the Australian homeless and those in desperate need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Labor Party should get its priorities right. In this budget it has not got its priorities right. It thought it was going to the electorate with an election budget, but it has not got it right. I think it is a budget that is seen by the community for what it really is; that is, a sham, a shonk. There are no real benefits in there for anybody except the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we know what will happen in a couple of months time. Certainly in Cowan, I know what will happen.

Stock Exchange records show that Takumi became a director of this company on 14 January 1987. On 12 September 1988, the name of the company was changed to Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd, nominating its principal activity as `real estate ownership'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret to inform the House that, despite Masaru Takumi's Australian and international notoriety, he is still a property owner in Surfers Paradise.

An ASC extract as at today's date shows that John Shand ceased to be the principal executive officer of Takumi Enterprises Pty Ltd on 6 August 1993, and as from that date has been replaced by an Edward Beaumont of Coomera.

A few days ago, with much political fanfare, Attorney-General Lavarch and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced a new justice policy. Undoubtedly, the choice of Brisbane as the policy release venue was done to buttress the flagging fortunes of the Goss government, and the poor light in which that government currently appears on the issue of law and order.

It has the motto `Strive for success', which I guess is a very good motto to have. Within this newsletter I picked up a small page commencing with `A flying start'. It deals with children in their early years starting off and how important those first three years of schooling are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newsletter mentions the work that the school is doing with its prep literacy program, how well that program is going in years 1, 2 and 3 and that the students need all the support they can get. In this school they certainly are. There is a program operating in Tasmania which allows schools to pick up other resources to continue with this program and to start this program in other schools in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess a primary school has got every right to go out and bat for itself in primary education. It is good to see. The newsletter mentions there is no reason why we should have five secondary teachers while we only have four teachers in the primary area for the same number of students. That is certainly true; it should not happen. We need to address that right throughout our country in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw in the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> last weekend that there seems to be an argument going on internally in Victoria on education, which has been happening in recent times. I think that has got something to do with the attitude of that government in the way it treats people as it tries to come to grips with its policy areas. The editorial mentions a program called LAP, which I do not know very much about other than it is an attempt to try to get a measuring stick on children between years 3 and 5. I wish them well in that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Primary Principals Association is giving support to the need for literacy skills to be developed in those early days at school between K and 3. A Canadian educationist, Professor John Novak, is apparently visiting our country and speaking on those early days. But I understand that there are concerns in using measuring sticks. This editorial touches on the need to be very careful in that some parents feel their children can get stigmatised by not passing some test and therefore they have got some brand on them. That is true. We have to be very careful in how that measuring is done so that it is not used to regress or send children backwards in some way. That is an important point which I am very pleased is picked up in that editorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The editorial also mentions the inadequacy of resources in some schooling systems. Of course, you cannot do anything unless you have resources. There is a great need to make sure that the schools in our education system have the resources.

At the end of last year we debated a bill which abolished the system that was known as the all milk levy. It was originally the Kerin plan and more recently the Crean plan, named after the minister at the table, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). It served to stabilise the dairy industry and bring it into the 1990s.

I recently received in the mail the April edition of the Australian Dairy Industry Council's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Milk matters</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I urge the government and the responsible ministers to be vigilant in this very important next stage of the implementation of the Uruguay Round. It is very important to what is an essential primary industry in Australia that is generating a lot of export income for this country. I know that the minister at the table put in a hell of a lot of work to maintain that industry at its current level and to see it go on to stronger things. There is this challenge before us now where the USA and the European Union are flagging the fact that they are going to fly in the face of that agreement that is yet to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study by the World Bank has recently suggested that the full benefits of the Uruguay Round agreement would be less than was first thought, as a result of some countries evading their full obligations under the agreement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May 24 commemorated the 50th anniversary of the death of Lieutenant Derrick on the remote island of Tarakan in 1945. Diver Derrick enlisted in the 2nd/48th Battalion in June 1940. Through four bitterly fought campaigns at Tobruk, El Alamein, Sattleburg in New Guinea and Borneo he revealed through his exploits the most incredible and extraordinary courage. Some say that in his early life there was nothing to suggest that one day he would receive the highest award for gallantry&mdash;the Victoria Cross. However, I believe his early life in Port Adelaide indicates otherwise. His early struggles were a portent of what was to come later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thomas Currie Derrick was born in 1914 in Menindie, a suburb of Adelaide. He&mdash;like many other South Australians, particularly in Port Adelaide&mdash;knew poverty and hardship as a child. He was enrolled at Le Fevre Peninsula Primary School, which was situated within 100 metres of the Port River. He left school aged 14 and was highly proficient at swimming and diving&mdash;perhaps an early indicator of the nickname Diver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around 1920, Tom's father, David, secured a job with the South Australian Harbours Board in Port Adelaide and he rented a house in Exeter. A little later, in 1924, more than 6,000 South Australian families were homeless. As the Depression grew, Diver was a 14-year-old onlooker when mounted and foot police clashed violently with wharf labourers and seamen in Port Adelaide. This happened in the winter of 1928, but the incident remained, as it did for many people, indelibly imprinted on him and he often spoke about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During these years, unemployment continued to soar. Photographs taken in 1931 show the banks of the Torrens River in Adelaide literally lined with humpies. Thousands of men were housed in shanty camps by the zoo. Weekly rations for a jobless family consisted of 1.3 kilograms of meat; four loaves of bread; some sugar, jam or honey; oatmeal or rice; tea; raisins; and soap. They were tough times indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1931 Tom Derrick and 13 other young lads gathered one morning at Exmouth Road, Glanville, and rode off on bicycles to Berri and hoped for work on the fruit blocks. During the next nine years he worked on fruit blocks in Berri but he commuted regularly to Port Adelaide. He married Beryl Leslie, a childhood sweetheart who lived in Largs Bay, in March 1940&mdash;four months prior to enlistment. His citation for the Victoria Cross award reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 24th November 1943 Sergeant Thomas Currie Derrick DCM was in command of a platoon of a company of Australian infantry ordered to attack a feature 150 yards from the township of Sattleburg. For over two hours many unsuccessful attempts were made, under heavy fire from enemy strong points at the top of a precipitous cliff which the company had to scale to reach the objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task appeared impossible, and shortly before last light the company was ordered to retire. Sergeant Derrick requested, and was granted, permission to make one last attempt. Moving ahead of his forward section he personally destroyed with hand grenades an enemy post which had been holding up this section.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Undoubtedly the capture of Sattleburg&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) is the person at the table during the adjournment debate tonight because I have something I wish to raise with him. I preface my comments by making a couple of qualifications. I share his concern about youth unemployment. Today he mentioned a figure of about 30 per cent. I also wholeheartedly and enthusiastically want to see programs put in place that will help youths gain employment. I also say that I am a supporter and sponsor of the Royal Life Saving Society. I wish to raise a couple of points with the minister that hopefully he will be able to take on board and perhaps think about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Life Saving Society is a successful tenderer for employment programs through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It has three programs at the moment: a jobskills program, a new work program and a new work opportunity program. After becoming a successful tenderer, the society was granted a program in about December last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I spoke to a person from the department in Perth to confirm the fact that, if people are not successful in getting a job after six months of training, they lose their long-term unemployment status. They then go back to the start of the queue and work their way through it again. That is the preface I make about the new work opportunity program&mdash;a program that the minister may or may not be aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problems with the Royal Life Saving Society conducting this program. It is doing a great job. It has advertised this program as being `desperate to find young people to spend six months of fun in the sun'. The society is offering a new work opportunity program called the aquatic care program. The pamphlet advertising this aquatic care program states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To further your experiences, throughout the program we will be taking time off for surfing, windsurfing, body boarding, canoeing, abseiling and a variety of other cultural experiences.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the pamphlet, these cultural experiences include fishing, sailing, powerboat driving, snorkelling, and pool and river care. I have to question the employment opportunities from a program like that. There may be some in the recreational area or maybe pool lifeguarding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having talked to the project manager of this program, I know that the people starting this program have very low self-esteem and they are not, I guess, enthusiastic towards the employment processes they are going through at the moment. They have been treated very disrespectfully. The people who are joining this program are quite young. I think they are aged between 15 and 20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The course had 90-odd vacancies. Fifty-six registrations came from case managers, but only 36 people turned up when the course started on Monday. I have spoken to the project manager. He says that it is very hard to attract people for an extended period. This course has two periods of eight weeks where the participants are weeding the local riverbank. I question whether or not this is relevant employment training for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister to consider this: if these people cannot find employment after this period&mdash;they may; who knows?&mdash;how can we build them up with self-esteem training over a six-month period that gives them some purpose in life and then just drop them off the system and put them back where they started? We are talking about 15- to 20-year-old people who are suffering from low self-esteem. Considering the high rate of youth suicide in Australia, particularly with males, how can we just drop them off the system and put them back at the start again where they have to wait another 18 months before they are considered for training for the long-term unemployed?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Crean" NAMEID="DT4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they are considered at risk of long-term unemployment, they can go immediately into case management. It goes back to the case management function. They can be picked up.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V5">Mr RICHARD EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that comment, but some of these people are coming from case managers now. I am concerned about the people who are on this program. I am concerned about their job opportunities at the end. This may be just a self-esteem program. Although that would be good for them and that is what it should be, I am concerned about their employment opportunities in areas like abseiling and powerboat driving. I do not think there is a lot of employment opportunities in those areas. At the end of the course perhaps the minister's people in Perth could review the people concerned. If they do get jobs, that is great. But, if they do not get jobs, I ask that they not be put back at the start of the queue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other points I would like to make in the last minute I have to speak is that this particular person who brought this to my attention suffers from sensitive skin and skin cancer and was told, `Unless you appear at this particular training, your benefits will be cut off.' For medical reasons he can't do it. That is why it came to my attention in the first place. I am wondering whether the minister could review some of those programs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is entirely appropriate on a night such as this for the House to discuss the great game of rugby league. At the outset, let me declare my interest. I proudly serve as a patron of the Western Suburbs club at Campbelltown but experience a conflict of interest whenever the team plays St George, having followed the mighty Dragons since the age of seven. I grew up in a rugby league home, like most working families in Sydney. It was our source and subject of entertainment, loyalty, fanaticism and even a little ambition. As my mother still reminds me, our choice of Sunday night television viewing was entirely dependent on whether St George had won or lost that afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has undergone a vast sea change in our economy, social values and national culture over the past 20 years. As the House would appreciate, I could not be classed as an opponent of internationalisation but rather a strong, some would say fanatical, supporter. I remain, however, just as strong a supporter and participant in Australia's various modes of popular culture. For this reason I lament the advent of the superleague and those things it is taking from the game of rugby league. I do not believe that large corporations, particularly media companies, should own an entire sporting competition&mdash;a part of our national culture&mdash;such as rugby league, AFL or cricket. Australian sport&mdash;through the Broncos and NBL&mdash;has already experienced corporations owning teams. My point is that no one corporation should own all the teams and thereby establish anti-competitive practices. The administration of the game should involve much more than maximising profits for either Rupert Murdoch or Kerry Packer. The interests of rugby league supporters and the code's junior players should not be sacrificed for the sake of corporate dollars. Corporate sponsorship and television rights should be kept separate from the collective club based management of the code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A club like Wests in my electorate, covering such good and growing rugby league areas such as Campbelltown and Liverpool, would have a great future if it is allowed to expand and develop. I would suggest for all parliamentarians on both sides of the House an interest in this issue, not just as supporters but also as legislators. With the advent of pay TV and superhighway technology, we need to address this simple question, not just for league but for all Australian sport: will the public interest be best served by the commercial media-based ownership of sporting competitions or by a form of collective management controlled by the clubs themselves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The News Ltd takeover bid for rugby league should be viewed as part of a fundamental shift in media strategies. Rupert Murdoch is already a dominant player internationally in the ownership and provision of media content, especially for entertainment services. His aggressive move into the Australian market for sport content should be marked out as a first order concern for regulators. This assessment, however, should not be taken as condoning the position of the Australian rugby league and its administrators. Indeed, they were foolish to sign away exclusive commercial broadcasting rights to Kerry Packer's Nine Network for seven years from 1993 to the year 2000, knowing that during this period the advent of pay TV would substantially alter the market value and coverage of their code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the superleague administrators talk about `our game' they are really talking about Rupert Murdoch's game because he has the clubs, and hence the players, under contract. The future of the superleague is entirely dependent on Murdoch's financial commitment and corporate strategy. I am just as concerned, however, that Kerry Packer has been presented with a spot on the ARL board and Optus Vision has now taken the major ownership share of ARL player contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what needs to be done to protect the public interest and regulate corporate interests? Immediately it should be recognised that the parliament already has in place extensive regulation of media companies in the form of cross-ownership laws, foreign ownership restrictions, anti-siphoning pay TV limits and the general provisions of the trade practices and corporations law. In that respect, I am delighted to see the Minister for Communications and the Arts, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), back from a productive overseas trip, actually in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament and the government should consider amendments to these laws consistent with the following three principles. First, our national sporting codes should be included among the cross-ownership laws covering media corporations. This would prevent the vertical integration of the media industry and of the ownership and potential monopolistic control of sporting content. Second, foreign ownership restrictions should apply to our national sporting codes. Sport is an intensely nationalistic activity and as such is best kept in Australian hands. Third, an access regime should be established for the broadcasting rights for sporting content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now conclude, hoping that other honourable members will join this important discussion and debate. At least those from New South Wales can join with me in barracking for tonight's game. As they are about to kick off in Melbourne, I end by saying, `Carn the Blues!'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep the House for long. I just wanted to respond very briefly to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) by saying that the government's main concern throughout the long running debate about the future of the coverage of rugby league and the future coverage of many sporting codes is to ensure that the public continues to have access to major sporting events on free to air television. That is why this parliament has enacted the laws that deny pay television exclusive rights to the so-called anti-siphoning list.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay TV can secure the Australian pay TV rights to those events only if the free to air broadcaster has first secured those free to air rights for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I will naturally give due consideration to the suggestion of the honourable member for Werriwa that codes be incorporated in the cross-media ownership laws in some way, I have to say that my immediate reaction, having heard his persuasive arguments, is that I think he is yet to persuade me that that is the way we should be going. To seek to allocate codes between one media owner and another media owner in some way would become rather difficult to regulate. Given his propensity to argue for market forces and competition to reign in many other areas of the economy, I suspect that that might be one suggestion that could be more difficult to implement, despite the honourable motives that are, no doubt, behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Werriwa also raised a number of other very important issues which are the subject of a lot of debate on both sides of the House, about the Speaker seeking to encourage a compromise between the ARL and the Super League. I know the honourable member for Werriwa, the Speaker and many other members are motivated by seeking to ensure that the fans and the players determine what is best for rugby league in Australia. The government has always sought to encourage the players, the clubs and the fans to determine their own future, rather than have the government intervene to anoint one side as the winner or loser in this battle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the government remains committed to ensuring that the best of rugby league, whatever the name of the competition or code, remains freely available on free to air television. We have received assurances from both the ARL and Super League that two or three events from whatever the competition may be called will continue to be available on free to air TV. That is the main issue that is in my mind in looking at how we can address this particular battle between Super League and the ARL. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill makes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953, the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992, and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The bill also makes minor technical amendments to a number of acts, as set out in schedule 2 of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important element of the government's child-care policy is the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate. Introduced in July 1994, this cash payment helps offset child-care expenses for children while both parents are, or the sole parent is, working, studying, training or looking for work.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents who are using child care for any of these work-related purposes can claim a rebate on the cost of formal child-care services, such as centre based long day care and family day care, or informal child care, such as care provided by nannies and baby-sitters. The child-care cash rebate is administered by the Health Insurance Commission&mdash;Medicare. The introduction of the child-care cash rebate recognises the fact that the cost of the child care is a legitimate work expense for parents in the labour force. It has improved the affordability of child care for many working parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill includes amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 to ensure consistency with the intentions of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>The first group of amendments provide hardship provisions to assist certain groups of persons who are currently precluded from receiving the rebate but who should be entitled to the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA>These groups are:</PARA>
<PARA>-children over the age of 13 years who have a disability or other specified special need which requires ongoing child care;</PARA>
<PARA>-parents who should be considered to have work-related commitments, such as those who are eligible for, but not in receipt of, a carer pension; and</PARA>
<PARA>-families in which one parent has a work-related commitment, but the other parent is unable to work or look after their children due to extenuating circumstances, such as a medical condition. </PARA>
<PARA>An amendment is sought to allow carers under the age of 18 years who have specified formal child-care qualifications to register under the scheme. Further amendments are proposed to confirm in legislation that family registration is able to be backdated to the date at which the family was first eligible to register, and that the rebate can be paid when a child is absent from child care for specified reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are some administrative amendments proposed to rectify a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen, and to make consequential amendments to the act to bring it in line with changes to other Commonwealth legislation. These include amendments to allow the suspension of family and carer registrations if cancellation of registration is being considered. This will avoid unnecessary recoveries by government, while ensuring that individuals maintain their right to appeal against long-term decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other administrative amendments are proposed to:</PARA>
<PARA>-allow the Health Insurance Commission to backdate carer registrations to the date at which they were first eligible to register;</PARA>
<PARA>-cancel family or carer registrations and recover payments when an administrative error has been made;</PARA>
<PARA>-ensure that the rebate is not paid for child-care expenses which have been, or will be, reimbursed by another agent such as an employer;</PARA>
<PARA>-clarify the eligibility of persons who are not Australian citizens by correcting the description of visa categories to bring the act into line with changes in the Migration Act;</PARA>
<PARA>-broaden the nature of courses which overseas students can be undertaking in order to be eligible for the rebate;</PARA>
<PARA>-allow the managing director of the Health Insurance Commission to delegate powers;</PARA>
<PARA>-allow the minister to have some discretion over receipting requirements; and</PARA>
<PARA>-remove technical defects in the original act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the proposed amendments will be retrospective back to the introduction of the rebate on 1 July 1994, so as to provide maximum assistance to families who should have been entitled to the rebate. Whilst the financial impact of these amendments will be minimal, they serve to strengthen the original intention of the act and to clarify and facilitate certain procedural aspects of the child-care cash rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed to the Health Insurance Act 1973 are designed to correct a number of minor drafting errors in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994, which established the professional services review scheme. In addition, the amendments will allow the appointment as a president of a professional services review tribunal of a person who holds or has held judicial office in a state or territory jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professional services review tribunals consider requests from affected practitioners for a review of a determination of a penalty&mdash;which may include the disqualification from Medicare&mdash;following a finding by a professional services review committee that the practitioner has engaged in inappropriate practice. It was not realised at the time the legislation was drafted that section 21 of the Acts Interpretation Act specifies that a reference in any act to the word `office' shall be construed as a reference to an office in or for the Commonwealth. The proposed amendment corrects this oversight, which has limited significantly the number of persons who can be considered for appointment as a tribunal president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 are designed to correct a deficiency in the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Act 1994. That act, which gave the Health Insurance Commission the power to investigate fraud under Medicare and to deal directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions, does not allow the Health Insurance Commission to retain evidential material seized under the authority of a search warrant for more than 60 days unless proceedings for an offence to which that material may afford evidence is instituted within that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the powers of investigation legislation is modelled in large part on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has pointed out that the provision relating to the retention of seized material was based on a similar provision in an early version of the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1994. That latter provision was subsequently altered to allow the retention of evidential material until the reason for its seizure no longer exists or it is decided that it is not to be used in evidence. The proposed amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act provide for the retention of such material in similar circumstances. The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has advised that, without the proposed amendments, the commission's search warrant powers are effectively unusable&mdash;not a desirable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also empowers the Health Insurance Commission to engage in hedging of investment transactions, provide consulting, management and related services and exercise its powers and perform its functions overseas. The commission has undertaken a number of consultancies primarily, but not exclusively, under the auspices of the World Bank. As these activities are expanding, and moving beyond the use of spare capacity in the commission's operations, it is desirable to make explicit provision to cover this activity. The Health Insurance Commission is an Australian organisation at the forefront of international best practice in the performance of its various functions. Its expertise is recognised both within Australia and internationally. The commission is in a position to perform a flagship role for Australia in areas attracting growing international attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the proposed hedging power is concerned, this is consistent with other Commonwealth legislation and has been addressed, on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, to resolve any doubt about the commission's ability to enter into hedging transactions. Hedging is, of course, one of the tools necessary in a prudent and balanced investment program which includes some overseas investments. The commission operates Medibank Private in competition with other private insurers and must have available to it the same opportunities to manage the funds vested in it by its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also contains amendments to parts of the National Health Act 1953 which regulate the administration of nursing homes. The government has decided that these amendments should not await the introduction of the new Aged Care Act. The amendments to the current legislation are essential to address two immediate concerns that have been identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first concern relates to the complexities of the current payment system. The second concern relates to nursing homes which are able to charge increased fees to their residents and yet fail to provide the basic standard of nursing and personal care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first concern is addressed by a series of minor amendments that relate to the simplification of the nursing home payment system. Many of the criticisms of the administration of this program relate to the complexity of the current system. Both the November 1994 report of the Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee on the validation of CAM and SAM funding of nursing homes and the Auditor-General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 19: 1994-95 Efficiency audit&mdash;validation of nursing home funding</EMPHASIS> acknowledge the complexities of the current system and have identified problems which have arisen as a direct result of these complexities. For example, the Auditor-General has identified problems in the delivery of appropriate information to nursing home proprietors relating to the Commonwealth's requirements for the payment of benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these simplification measures can be legally achieved by changes to subordinate legislation&mdash;that is, the nursing homes financial arrangements principles, a disallowable instrument&mdash;it is proposed to proceed down this path. This would allow simplification to proceed quickly and therefore result in a clear and demonstrable response to one of the concerns of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of these simplification measures will not result in any change in the entitlement of nursing home proprietors to Commonwealth benefits. These measures will not result in any change to the level of advances paid to nursing home proprietors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplification measures will make it easier for a nursing home proprietor to see how the level of Commonwealth benefit was calculated. The current daily calculation of `loadings', under or over expenditure of amounts paid for nursing and personal care, and OCRE, other cost reimbursed expenditure, will cease and these amounts will be included in the level of advance payment on a monthly basis. These amounts will no longer form part of the `scale of fees' determined under subsection 40AA(6) but will be included in calculation of the `notional scale of fees' determined under section 46D of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to sections 40AD, 40ADA and 51A of the act are consequential to the above simplification measures. These amendments will preserve the right of a nursing home proprietor to seek a `merits review' of the decision as to how much Commonwealth benefit is advanced under section 51A. An aggrieved nursing home proprietor will continue to be able to seek the referral of an appeal to the Nursing Homes Fees Review Committee of Inquiry of a decision on the level of Commonwealth benefit paid under section 51A. The retention of a right of `merits review' is essential to ensure that unnecessary and costly appeals to the courts are circumvented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern is addressed by a series of minor amendments that relate to nursing homes which have been granted `exempt bed status.' Recent newspaper reports relating to the compliance of nursing homes with the standards made under section 45D of the act have highlighted an anomaly in the current legislation. The anomaly is that the current provisions of the act do not enable the revocation or suspension of `exempt bed status' for those nursing homes which have failed to satisfy the standards for nursing home care. The anomaly must be immediately addressed and the amendments contained in the bill will overcome this concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The granting of an `exempt bed status' under section 39AB of the act enables a proprietor to charge additional fees to nursing home patients. One of the criteria for granting `exempt bed status' is that the nursing home provides a higher level of accommodation and services than are normally available at a nursing home. It is clearly incongruous to continue to allow a nursing home to charge additional amounts for a supposed increased level of accommodation and services, when the level of nursing and personal care fails to meet the basic standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in this bill provide the power to suspend or revoke the `exempt bed status' of a nursing home where there is a declaration in force, under subsection 45E(1), that the nursing home does not satisfy the standards determined under section 45D of the act. The amendments make it clear that while the `exempt bed status' of a nursing home is suspended, or revoked, a proprietor will be unable to charge the increased level of fees that would otherwise be payable by the nursing homes' patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the exercise of this new power will only occur where there are serious breaches of the section 45D standards. The decision to suspend the `exempt bed status' of a nursing home will be made where there is some prospect of the standards being reached within a short period of time and where both the nursing home proprietor and management show a commitment to taking remedial action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to revoke the `exempt bed status' of a nursing home will be made where the nursing home proprietor or management fail to show a commitment to taking appropriate action within a reasonable time frame. Where there is little prospect of standards being reached within a reasonable period of time, then the current power, in section 44 of the act, will be used to revoke the approval of the nursing home altogether. The decision to suspend or revoke `exempt bed status' is to be subject to internal review, as well as review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment to the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 is to specify directly the health ministers to be consulted by the minister before appointing the chairperson of the council, the chairperson of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, a principal committee of the council, and the member of the Australian Health Ethics Committee classified as a person with knowledge of the ethics of medical research. Currently, the act provides that the minister is to consult in relation to these appointments with other members of the Australian Health Ministers Conference. The composition of that membership can of course vary from time to time and currently includes the New Zealand minister for health. The proposed amendment would specify that it is the health minister of each state and territory who is to be consulted in relation to the appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the amendments made to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. One of the principal purposes of these amendments is to establish the basis for a new accelerated process for placing listable drugs supplied in Australia on the Australian register of therapeutic goods and to provide better definition to some poorly understood aspects of the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods which have been identified in its first four years of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A mechanism to address shortages or the absence of essential drugs required by the public in emergency situations has also been included in the bill. Amendments that update and consolidate the entry, search and warrant powers in the new part of the act have also been included, together with changes to align the monetary penalties in the current legislation with the `penalty units' classifications used in other Commonwealth regulatory legislation. The bill also closes a gap within the current regulatory scheme, by which legal therapeutic goods of unknown quality, safety or efficacy are at present not able to be removed from the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments in the bill include a provision to replace the Therapeutic Goods Administration trust account with the Therapeutic Goods Administration reserve, consistent with changes to be made by the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1995 and related bills that will replace the Audit Act 1901. The appeal provisions in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 relating to the review of decisions to register therapeutic goods have also been tightened. This is intended to ensure that technical and scientific data sought to be relied upon in connection with a general marketing application will be properly evaluated before a review on merits is undertaken by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the success stories of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 has been the orderly transfer of listable products&mdash;vitamin and minerals, homoeopathic, herbal and sunscreen preparations above SPF4&mdash;into the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods. Since the commencement of the legislation on 15 February 1991 some 14,000 listed drug products have been placed on the Australian register of therapeutic goods, and are currently being added to at the rate of some 2,000 per annum. This very strong demand for listing new products on the Australian register of therapeutic goods reflects the keen interest in the community in having access to safe and well manufactured alternative medicines, and the expectation is that the present very high level of product applications will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact on the Therapeutic Goods Administration of the very high number of product applications has been substantial, with the average approval times for individual products averaging five months&mdash;well in excess of the initial target of 30 days. To address this problem, the government provided $0.775 million in the 1994-95 budget for the development of a new streamlined process for listing products on the Australian register of therapeutic goods which would cut product approval time to a matter of weeks, without in any way affecting the quality or safety of the medicinal products. The new process makes absolutely no changes to the policy on listed products but does provide a fully automated document lodgment and assessment process, which will be available to industry from 1 July 1995. The new electronic lodgment facility and all supporting documentation have been developed through a steering committee with membership drawn from the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the three affected industry organisations and the Consumer Health Forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new accelerated listing process continues the pre-market assessment of applications which is one of the central planks of the national regulatory scheme. Responsibility for making the assessment will be vested in the applicant, who will be able to undertake the assessment against published criteria and documentation and submit an application in a form which is electronically compatible with the Australian register of therapeutic goods database. Applications are to be accompanied by a certificate that the goods are eligible for listing, are safe for the purposes for which they are to be used, their presentation is acceptable, they conform to standards and have been manufactured by an appropriately licensed manufacturer in Australia. Goods which are manufactured outside Australia will still require TGA approval of the manufacturer before a listing application can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lodgment of an electronic application under the accelerated listing process is expected to be able to reduce the time frame for product approval from an average of five months to approximately two weeks. Subsequent to the approval, the TGA will carry out a 100 per cent audit of product eligibility, both in terms of formulations and claims made, and will subsequently undertake a random audit of applications which are lodged annually for listing on the Australian register of therapeutic goods. The accelerated listing process will meet the requirements of industry for certainty in terms of product launches, whilst maintaining the existing high level of surveillance of product quality and safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that the TGA surveillance demonstrates that certification by a sponsor was false, then provision is included in the bill for cancellation to be immediate on any safety related issues but, in other circumstances&mdash;for example, less serious label errors&mdash;sponsors would have the opportunity to make a submission before any decision is taken to proceed to cancel the product. Any decision by the TGA to cancel the product listing is subject to appeal to the minister and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new provision, section 19A, has been included in the act to provide the government with the means to deal with acute shortages of drugs supplied in Australia or that no longer are supplied here by their sponsors, or to temporarily allow into the Australian market a drug that is not available in Australia but is required to address an emergency. The act as it stands allows individual patients to access unapproved drugs in limited circumstances. This entails prescribers to gain individual permission for each patient from Canberra, or for a prescriber to seek the status of an authorised prescriber under the special access scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although both of these schemes are used with advantage to permit the supply of small volumes of unregistered drugs, they are too unwieldy and too slow to make available substitute drugs, or new drugs, on a larger scale to meet an unforeseen emergency or to permit interim supply of a product registered overseas during the period of evaluation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons why approval may be sought and granted for supply of drugs under this provision. For example, a company may find itself out of stock of a particular product and wish to supply the same product as registered in the United States or Canada. Recently, there has been a shortage in Australia of lithium drugs used in the treatment of mental illness. It has proved very difficult to obtain a substitute product from an overseas source because of the requirement to have the product registered prior to supply in Australia. Companies who have the product have been understandably unwilling to go to the trouble and expense of registration as a stop-gap measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although vast improvements have been made in the approval time for new drugs in Australia, it remains inevitable that companies will register their drugs in America or Europe prior to introduction into Australia and that Australian patients and their doctors may have to wait until a company applies to register a drug in Australia. Provided that an application is in place in Australia and that the drug is deemed to have a unique therapeutic potential by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, it is proposed to permit limited supply on the basis of one or more overseas approvals. In this context, Australia has a number of arrangements in place for the interchange of information with reputable drug regulatory agencies around the world. These include the United States, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Through its membership of the PER&mdash;that is, the pharmaceutical evaluation reports&mdash;scheme, Australia is in a position to deal with most European agencies and with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emergence of new diseases, new treatments and medical emergencies may mandate the supply of unregistered medicines as an emergency measure. Such an occasion might be the need to immunise a large number of people against a tropical disease with a vaccine held in insufficient quantities in Australia. If such a vaccine is not registered in Australia, supply is presently cumbersome requiring individual approval from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety measures to be put in place will include resorting to temporary approval under section 19A when no registered substitute produce is available. Furthermore, delegations under this section are to be limited to the national manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the head of the drug safety and evaluation branch. Restrictions and conditions relating to the supply of such substitute products may be imposed to ensure that this provision cannot be used to avoid the process of drug evaluation and registration in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interface between food and drugs has been a source of considerable confusion since the commencement of the Therapeutic Goods Act in 1991.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was referring to these very important negotiations between the National Food Authority, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, state and territory health agencies, and the food and pharmaceutical industries, which were aimed at clarifying the food-drug interface. The outcome of these negotiations was agreement to introduce a definition of `food' into the Therapeutic Goods Act which made it quite clear that decisions on what constituted a food or a therapeutic good were closely linked to its presentation and promotion and that a food could not be restricted by any specific dosage limit. The words `prescribed dose' and `frequency of administration' have been included in the definition of `food' and are to be read in a pharmaceutical sense, and are not intended to encompass serving suggestions applied to or normally associated with food and beverages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing legislation has an anomaly in that it contains provision for a product to be removed from the market if it is cancelled from the Australian register of therapeutic goods, but has no similar provision for removing from the market illegal therapeutic goods that were never included in the register, whose quality, safety and efficacy are unknown. Where such products are detected and action is taken against sponsors, there is no existing basis whereby these products can be removed from the market pending either prosecution or submission of an application to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for inclusion of the product on the Australian register of therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision has therefore been included in the bill to enable the secretary to require persons to take steps to recover from the market any illegal therapeutic goods or to inform the public in a specified manner, and within a reasonable time frame, that the product has not been reviewed for quality, safety or efficacy by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Decisions of the secretary in this matter are appealable to the minister and to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also proposes to redraft the main offence provision in the legislation, which currently provides that offences of import, export, manufacture or supply of goods in Australia are committed by a person who is the sponsor of therapeutic goods. The definition of sponsor does not, however, include a person who exports, imports, manufactures or arranges for the export, import or manufacture of goods on behalf of another person who is a resident of, or carrying on business in, Australia. The effect of the current provision is that the TGA must undertake intrusive investigations into the business affairs of persons that still fail to establish who the sponsor of the goods is, precluding any proceedings from being instituted to deter or prevent the unlawful supply of unapproved and sometimes dangerous therapeutic goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to clear away the need for such investigations into matters that can best be established by those in possession of facts best known to themselves, the sponsors, by establishing that the offence of import, export, manufacture or supply of goods in Australia for use in humans is committed by a person, and by including a statutory defence for the person to demonstrate that he was not the sponsor of the goods at the time the offence was committed. This arrangement will protect the innocent agent from prosecution, and remove from the TGA the requirement to undertake extensive investigations into the business affairs of persons who are simply acting as the agents for product sponsors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act currently contains provisions for entry, search, inspection, sampling and seizure in relation to premises of sponsors, manufacturers and other premises for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the act, ensuring compliance with standards (GMP audits and post-market surveillance) and gathering evidence of offences committed against the act. These provisions are restricted to authorised persons, are provided for both with and without warrant, and are spread across a number of sections and subsections contained within parts 3 (sponsors), 4 (manufacturers) and 6 (any premises) of the act. The bill proposes to consolidate these provisions into a new part 5A entitled `Entry, searches and warrants', the existing powers have been reviewed and the provisions have been redrafted to bring them into line with the current legal policy cited in part 1AA of the Crimes Act 1914, which was inserted by the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Act 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill now makes it quite clear that entry without warrant to the premises of sponsors and manufacturers cannot be exercised at residential premises unless the sponsor or manufacturer uses the premises for commercial purposes in relation to therapeutic goods as well as a residence. The bill also introduces a power of entry to enable authorised persons to enter premises where it is necessary to do so in the interests of public health so as to avoid an imminent risk of death, serious illness or serious injury. This provision is sought to enable, for example, the prevention of extremely dangerous products from entering the market (in the case, say, of toxic contamination); or the halting of dangerous manufacturing process (in the case, say, of a clandestine laboratory utilising volatile chemicals). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also proposes that a number of indictable offence provisions in the act be reduced to summary offences. Since the inception of the act, experience has shown that these matters can be more appropriately dealt with by a court of summary jurisdiction rather than through the much more lengthy trial process. This change will convenience both the Crown and the accused as well as the judicial system. The act currently contains forfeiture upon conviction provisions in relation to illicit goods. This provision currently applies only to summary offences. The bill proposes that the illicit goods, the subject of indictable conviction, also be forfeitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments detailed in this bill largely address process and safety:</PARA>
<PARA>-the process by which drug products supplied in Australia are listed on the ARTG, as well as providing a basis for distinguishing between foods and drug products, and</PARA>
<PARA>-safety, in providing a mechanism to remove products of unknown quality, safety and efficacy from the market. </PARA>
<PARA>The bill also reviews and consolidates the enforcement provisions under the Therapeutic Goods Act, and brings them into line with the most recent Commonwealth policy in this area. As such, the bill will substantially assist the sponsors of listable drug products in getting good quality and well manufactured medicines onto the market in a short time frame, whilst improving the ability of the Therapeutic Goods Administration to protect the Australian public from substandard, unsafe or ineffective products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other changes included in the bill are provisions to replace the Therapeutic Goods Administration trust account with a new reserve account, consistent with changes to be effected by the new financial management package, including the proposed Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 that will replace the Audit Act 1901. Section 45 of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 will establish a Therapeutic Goods Administration reserve and make provision for the annual appropriation of moneys into the reserve equal to the receipts identified under that section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to the appeals procedure for the review of decision to register or not register therapeutic goods under section 25 of the act have also been included in item 148. These changes are designed to encourage applicants for general marketing of registrable therapeutic goods to provide all relevant scientific and technical data to the secretary before a decision on registration is made under section 25 of the act and to ensure that any new technical and scientific material not previously before the secretary will undergo proper evaluation before a decision on review based upon merits is made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak on the first portfolio under the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. I hope calling it No. 1 does not mean that it is the first of a number of omnibus bills to come through this year. There is no miscellaneous provisions bill here, no tidying up of an act here and there. This is an act with almost 150 different items which introduce substantial amendments to three acts: the Childcare Rebate Act, the National Health Act and Therapeutic Goods Act. Just how substantial the act is is shown by the length of the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech. I hope this sort of legislation is not something that will be copied too often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the parliamentary secretary has pointed out, this bill amends six enactments: the Childcare Rebate Act 1993; the Health Insurance Act 1973; the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973; the National Health Act 1853; the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992; and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. My colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) will have something to say about the Childcare Rebate Act. I will make some comments about the amendments to the other enactments. I will say, however, that I will not require as much time as the parliamentary secretary. This is essentially because the coalition, whilst being somewhat irritated at the way these amendments have been lumped together, does not oppose the provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted that, in contrast with some other legislation that I have had to deal with of late, the government has consulted effectively with groups involved&mdash;the aged care industry, the therapeutic goods industry, the Attorney-General's Department and other interested parties&mdash;to ensure that the legislation reflects sound day-to-day practice. The results are some commonsense approaches to commonly agreed problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before saying anything in particular about the proposed changes to the National Health Act and the Therapeutic Goods Act, I just say for the record that the proposed amendments to the other enactments covered by this bill are basically straightforward and are, on the whole, cleaning up some definitional uncertainties. In respect of the National Health and Medical Research Council Act, for instance, these amendments will not affect the council's operations but will simply clarify the definition of health ministers by referring to their offices rather than membership of the Australian Health Ministers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say something briefly about the Health Insurance Commission Act amendments. We accept the government's assurance about the need to recast the commission's power to retain seized evidentiary material to ensure that its search and seizure powers are effective without intruding inordinately on the liberty of the citizen. Similarly, we do not oppose the proposed empowerment of the commission to engage in the hedging of investment transactions, although we notice that the commission would largely be exercising this power on behalf of Medibank Private. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government believes that the commission, as the operator of Medibank Private in competition with other private health insurers, needs to have fund management powers consistent with its competitors, perhaps it will also admit that the commission's high level of infrastructure support actually gives Medibank Private a cost advantage over its competitors. Surely this cost advantage is one of the reasons why Medibank Private, as was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne last weekend, is able to offer the best deals under the government's new legislation, while paring its reserves back to the statutory bone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before leaving this act, I should say that I am somewhat ironically impressed that the Health Insurance Commission has the resources to spread its wings formally into the consultancy market. I hope that the new found entrepreneurial drive does not distract scarce taxpayer funded resources from the important primary role the commission has in the administration of the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits schemes. Presumably, any consultancy fees will in some way be ploughed back into the commission's operations, thus reducing the Health Insurance Commission's need for recurrent Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the National Health Act amendments in relation to ministerial and regulatory powers relating to exempt bed status nursing homes. As honourable members will be aware, exempt bed status homes provide above normal standard accommodation and can share residents' direct fees for this level of service. They meet a growing demand for premium nursing home accommodation for those who are willing and able to pay for it. About six per cent of nursing home beds are now exempt, something the coalition in government may well look at boosting if there is a proven demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the government has pointed out, there is presently an anomaly relating to the compliance of exempt bed homes with the statutory outcome standards. That is, the act as presently worded does not enable the suspension of revocation of exempt bed status for those nursing homes which have failed to meet the outcome standards. This has attracted some attention as a result of an investigative report by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If exempt beds provided at a direct cost to the user are going to be a viable and attractive alternative in residential aged care, users and their families must have full confidence that the product they are purchasing is of the highest possible quality. Therefore, we do not oppose the government's amendments to the act to ensure the power to revoke and suspend exempt status, especially since our understanding is that the amendments also protect the interests of those residents who may enter the home on a normally funded basis in a period of suspension or revocation of exempt status. If these people find themselves hit financially if they want to stay in a home, or in an individual bed restored to exempt status, they should not be penalised unfairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the aged care industry organisations support the government's intentions. Having said this, I must say that the solution to the problem is driven by the nature of our present centralised and bureaucratic funding and management of residential aged care. I have made no secret of the fact that I would like to see a greater role for industry peer review in the nursing homes standards monitoring process. It certainly does not mean a deregulation of nursing home standards, nor does it mean the federal government walks away from standards&mdash;it should not&mdash;but the present system is cumbersome and bureaucratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also a little concerned that the inconsistent operation of the standards monitoring process around Australia may lead to unnecessary or premature imposition of suspension or revocation sanctions in some cases. We have had complaints of monitoring teams applying standards subjectively or unduly heavily, and I get the impression that different officers in different state branches of the Department of Human Services and Health themselves sometimes have varying interpretations of what is good practice against outcome standards and what is not. I note that any decision to suspend or revoke exempt bed status is reviewable internally and by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I simply hope these changes will not mean an undue expansion in the use of the review processes and therefore the drawing off of scarce public resources in relation to these reviews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to comment briefly on the proposed amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act. We welcome these amendments, which will facilitate the more streamlined listing of many low risk listable products under the national regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods. I am impressed by the new combined self-assessment and electronic checking process to ensure that pre-market assessment of such therapeutic goods is as swift and cost efficient as possible. This represents savings to manufacturers and marketers, and it represents savings to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, on the measures to deal with acute domestic shortages of drugs normally supplied in Australia, no longer supplied by an Australian sponsor or to allow temporary entry of the drugs still to be listed on the Australian register, provided that quality assurance exists&mdash;and I am assured this is the case&mdash;any reasonable freeing up of the importation requirements is a sensible step. I would urge the Therapeutic Goods Administration to monitor the operation of these and other liberalising measures in this bill to ensure that user and public safety is not being compromised by their operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the prosecution, search and seizure amendments contained in this bill, I will certainly say they make sense to me. I welcome the amendments ensuring that the innocent sponsor of a suspect therapeutic good is not prosecuted for something where he or she was in all innocence party to import, export, manufacture or supply. I welcome the general recodification of the Therapeutic Goods Act's penal, investigative and seizure powers in a clearer and centralised form and the making clearer of the powers under warrant of TGA officers acting within the law. I am a little uneasy about the extension of the seizure period from 60 to 90 days, but I understand the importance in some cases of needing to undertake or commission detailed evaluation and scientific analysis of seized substances as part of the evidence gathering process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I also welcome the opening of an added opportunity to have expert consideration in listing application decisions incorporated into the loops of internal or Administrative Appeals Tribunal reviews of what are invariably highly complex technical data and related information. I believe that the government's hope is that this will discourage applicants from doing `quick and nasty' listing applications with limited information available to the primary decision maker, in the hope of speeding up the process and reducing the need for review. I have to say, however, that in many ways we live in a `quick and nasty' world where there will always be people who hope to manipulate the system for their advantage. While commending the government's intention and supporting it, I will wait and see what its actual effects will be over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, the coalition does not oppose this bill. We accept the need to take the steps outlined in it and we believe that, on paper at least, the changes implemented by these amendments will be for the better. Once again, though, I point out that in this bill there is material for at least three, and perhaps more, bills of real substance which would have better been taken separately rather than in this omnibus form. It certainly would have helped us get a quicker understanding of what these amendments are trying to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the items refers to the temporary approval and supply of unevaluated drugs for use in Australia in limited circumstances, covering situations where there is a shortage of a registered drug in the Australian market or where a registered drug ceases to be available and there is no other equivalent registered product. I refer to a drug which has recently been very successfully used in Australia and emphasise the importance of the government accommodating its introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of illnesses under the broad definition of schizophrenia require a combination of drugs and psychological therapy. Until about 40 years ago it was almost impossible to find a satisfactory drug to deal with schizophrenia. People were hospitalised&mdash;I should say `institutionalised' because one could hardly call them hospitals&mdash;and were seen in the grounds hugging themselves and rocking or extremely violent in padded cells, perhaps having been given electric shock therapy. Very rarely were the drug therapies successful, and psychological therapy on its own was not particularly successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schizophrenia covers a wide range of illnesses, but it is really an extreme form of what has been described by Dr Ainslie Meares as `atavistic regression', regression to a primitive mode of thinking, which is an important facility in humans who seek relief from anxiety situations. Most of us get that: we are able to obtain regression to that primitive mode of thinking through a range of means, for instance, by listening to classical music for some. For others it might be sitting with a tinny in front of the footy, so the methods can vary a lot, although I must say that tests with students show that they study best using classical music, even if they think they do not like it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various ways of regressing to that primitive mode: relaxation is one; yoga is another. Having a holiday might be regression or even&mdash;I do not know that many do it now&mdash;chopping the wood, digging the garden or feeding the chooks. These might be ways of getting away from it all, where one can regress to where the mind is not particularly active. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schizophrenia was seen by Dr Ainslie Meares as an extreme form of regressing and not being able to come back into life. In other words, the person regresses as a defence against what might be some very major trauma. The condition is manifested in a range of behaviours, such as totally unpredictable, violent behaviour and aggression, or there could be just a placid withdrawal&mdash;someone may appear to be superficially pleasant but behind it all have suicidal tendencies. He or she regresses to that primitive mode of thinking, does not come away from it and `schizophrenia' is an all-embracing sort of definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clozapine has been used in Australia. The program at Woden has been available to people not only in the ACT but also to people in south-eastern New South Wales. The drug has had a great deal of success while on trial in Australia. A disease such as schizophrenia, which could be due to a genetic tendency, could be triggered, though, by trauma at home, at work or even, I believe, by smoking marijuana. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, the drugs that have been used before Clozapine have been successful with a range of people who suffer from schizophrenia. Drugs such as Melleril, Largactil, fluphenazine, Anatensol and Modecate have very often been effective. But there were patients&mdash;some of them caught on the borderline of schizophrenia&mdash;for whom these drugs were not very effective at all. They had a number of side effects, without having particularly beneficial effects in treatment of the disease. Clozapine was found to have side effects too, particularly a granulocytosis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woden Valley Hospital established a controlled program with Clozapine, where, after being hospitalised for some time, people were able to visit a therapist&mdash;first of all a pharmacist and then a nursing staffer was provided. Those patients were able to visit that therapist at required intervals. They were given blood tests and a range of other tests and discussed their experiences with the therapist. The dosage was adjusted appropriately on occasions when they returned to the therapeutic adviser. It was very often started at a high level and then reduced gradually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clozapine has shown a very high level of success in a number of areas. First of all, people were able to return to the work force after, in some cases, many years absence. They were able to return to study, when they had not been able to study&mdash;at school perhaps&mdash;for years. There was a reduced tendency towards suicide, and those people could take a better part in society, socially and at home within the family. Paranoia was reduced in many of the patients. In a number of them, the anxiety level was stabilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with other medical treatments, people need to be balanced with their dosage in order to cope with life, but not to have so high a dosage as to protect them from the normal psychological trauma which we all suffer. That is the difficult time. When the dosage is being reduced the patient experiences some trauma. The patient, the therapist and the family have to decide whether that trauma is the sort of trauma we all suffer in life from the pressures that come to bear on us. That is the challenge when people are being stabilised on a drug like Clozapine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe Clozapine ought to be extended&mdash;and this is an aside&mdash;to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, so that it is available to patients on an authority, rather than, for instance, patients in Eden having to travel some 250 to 280 kilometres to Woden Valley Hospital to see their therapist regularly, and to get the supply from the hospital. Once the therapy has been stabilised, surely the patient's doctor should be able to obtain an authority in Eden and supply the medication with the concurrence of the psychiatrist who is in charge of the patient, so that this patient is able to receive drugs and perhaps attend less often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attendances for drug supply, particularly at the beginning where there have been suicidal tendencies, need to be monitored very carefully. The amount of the drug given needs to be fairly limited. For that reason, any supply from the local pharmacist through a local doctor should be limited in quantity, especially at the beginning. Sometimes, if there are situations where patients are not being properly monitored, the general practitioner can at least ask those patients how they have been faring and, if they do not turn up, can contact them. This is an extremely important drug, which is now available to people who have schizophrenia, who have had no success with other drugs and who have been continually returning to hospital for further treatment. The number of returns to hospitalisation has also been reduced by the use of Clozapine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary has shown tremendous interest, and his appointment and his interest have encouraged people in the health field. I would say to him that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme ought to include Clozapine, and I know that the evidence which has come to me from the people who run the scheme in Woden and which I am happy to supply would substantiate what I have been saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the government on the bill as a whole. For instance, I have had people who have made representations to me who have been excluded from the rebate scheme under the Childcare Rebate Act but who should be eligible for the rebate. Specifically, children over the age of 13 who have a disability or other special need which requires ongoing care have been mentioned, as have their carers under the age of 18 who possess certain child-care qualifications. I believe that this may involve a slight increase in expenditure. Of course, we actually included these people in the estimate for the rebate scheme and then&mdash;I believe, inadvertently&mdash;they were not able to take advantage of the scheme. That is important. It is also important for the government on behalf of the taxpayer to get away from the situation where people are getting double payments for child care through, for example, an agency or an employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that have been made to the new procedures, requiring the secretary of the department to give marketing approval for drugs, where the sponsor of the product certifies a list of matters that relate to the safety and quality of the goods, are important. Also important is the requirement for the sponsor of goods that have been unlawfully supplied to inform the public that they were wrongly supplied and to take steps to recover any of the goods that have been distributed. I commend the bill to the House, and reiterate the importance of the ability of government, when it has a lot of information from overseas, to use the latest available beneficial drug as the treatment of choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As previous members have pointed out, this bill is an omnibus bill containing amendments to various pieces of legislation in the human services and health portfolio. This morning, I want to deal with the amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. According to the explanatory memorandum on the bill, these amendments are being presented to ensure consistency with the government's intentions for the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendments to the act provide hardship provisions to assist some people who are currently excluded from the child-care cash rebate, including children over the age of 13 who have a disability or other special need which requires ongoing child care, carers under 18 possessing suitable child-care qualifications, and parents who are currently unable to have work related commitments. In addition, the amendments allow for the suspension of family and carer registrations if cancellation of registration is under consideration. This measure is to avoid unnecessary recoveries by the government, while not abrogating individuals' rights to appeal longer-term decisions, presuming that the appeal is not upheld and that financial adjustments by government may be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments deal with a raft of issues, including backdating of carer registrations to the day the carer was first eligible to register; the cancellation of registrations due to administrative error; ensuring that rebates are not paid on child-care costs which are reimbursed by an employer; and other amendments of what is described as a clarifying nature. These include availability of the rebate for certain absences from care; backdating of family registration; eligibility of overseas students to claim the rebate; and correcting technical defects in the principal act which relate to recovery of overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of amendments and of the issues which they address highlights a number of the shortcomings of the government's child-care cash rebate scheme and underlines the lack of certainty and stability in the government's child-care policies. The child-care cash rebate was originally targeted to parents who have children aged under 13 and who use child-care facilities outside the home while they work, seek work or are in education. It was expected that some 230,000 Australian families would make use of the scheme. The government allocated $152 million to the scheme in its first year of operation. Now, less than one year after it has come into operation, the government has realised that its original assessments were wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimate for child-care cash rebate expenditure has been scaled back by over $60 million to $90 million&mdash;a massive underspending on the rebate in its first year. The government, to my knowledge, has not been able to satisfactorily explain this extraordinarily large discrepancy between its initial assessments and the actual outcome. Of, course, there is a possibility that claims are being `hoarded' by parents to be claimed in bulk at a later stage. If that is the case, it is possible that there will be a substantial blow-out in the estimates which have been provided in this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around the same time as the child-care cash rebate was introduced, the government also introduced the home child-care allowance. This payment to those parents who choose to look after their children at home, rather than participate in the paid work force, was to provide&mdash;and I quote the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an independent source of income for women in unpaid employment in the home. It will not be income tested on family income.</PARA>
<PARA>That was&mdash;as he usually does&mdash;putting the best light on things, because it was, of course, to be income tested, but to be income tested on the income of the principle carer. That was not highlighted in the Prime Minister's statement. The home child-care allowance was to replace the dependent spouse rebate and, as a payment direct to the primary care giver, recognised the unpaid work of women caring full-time for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the home child-care allowance was introduced, it was means tested, as I have said, on the income of the primary care giver. The promised $60 per fortnight was available to those care givers whose income was less than $10 per fortnight. Thereafter, the amount payable was reduced. This has impacted quite severely on low-income parents who may want to supplement their income by a small amount of part-time work. It is typical, really, of the way in which the government's child-care policies, including announcements made in the recent budget, have impacted adversely on lower income people and the way in which one would have to say that the battlers in this society have been extraordinarily, gravely disadvantaged by the policies that are being pursued. The child-care area is just one example amongst these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inequity between the child-care cash rebate and the home child-care allowance has been highlighted by the coalition since its inception. The child-care cash rebate is not means tested, while the home child-care allowance is. In addition, the rates of the two payments are quite different. A couple in paid employment seeking work or an education, with two children in formal care outside the home, can receive $61.20 per fortnight. A couple in which one partner works while the other stays at home to care for two children receives $30 per fortnight. It seems that, in the government's estimation, child care provided by parents is the least valued kind of child care in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance was introduced while the dependent spouse rebate was still existing. It was subsequently found that many families were worse off under the new system than they had been under the dependent spouse rebate. It was only after protracted argument that the coalition was able to ensure that people who qualified for the dependent spouse rebate, but were ineligible for the home child-care allowance, would not have their financial assistance reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the child-care cash rebate, the home child-care allowance was conceived in a blaze of publicity and fanfare, was born in subterfuge, and is now about to be hidden out of sight inside the new parenting allowance. This bill evidences the same lack of foresight and planning in the implementation of the child-care cash rebate as did the debacle the Minister for Social Security presided over when the home child-care allowance was introduced. The range of issues dealt with by this bill indicates that the government's implementation of the child-care cash rebate was hurried, ill-conceived and, in many respects&mdash;some of which are acknowledged in this bill&mdash;unfair. One would have to say that the measures to backdate registrations and extend eligibility for the rebate look something like an attempt to show that the initial estimates of expenditure on the scheme were not as wrong as they currently appear to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments extending care to parents in the home looking after children with a disability are a response to concerns expressed by parents: concerns which should have been considered before the act was introduced into the parliament. In my capacity as shadow minister for family services, I had a number of calls from parents caring for children with disabilities who currently received the rebate but who, once the child turned 13, were then ineligible to continue to receive it. They were also ineligible for any other kind of assistance under any other program. This of course put them in quite serious circumstances. The government was prepared to leave these people on the scrap heap when this scheme was first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent budget further confirmed the ad hoc nature of the decisions that the government makes in the child-care area. This lack of stability, lack of predictability, and continuing uncertainty for families, comes as one change after another is made by the government to its schemes. It leads to a situation where many people in the community, particularly those with less access to information and who find information rather harder to obtain, are disadvantaged by these continuing changes. The government has no strategy in this area. Decisions are made from year to year and, indeed, sometimes from month to month. It produces a high level of instability in the nature of the benefits, and in the terms and conditions on which they are provided. It means that many of those who would be entitled to these benefits never realise that they are entitled because they simply cannot keep up with what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this recent budget, the government mouthed its usual rhetoric of caring, while slashing outlays on child care. It claws back about $330 million from the commitments made to child care last year. For example, while amending the Childcare Rebate Act to ensure consistency with the intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme, the government has restricted access to child-care assistance to parents not in the paid work force. This is a measure which will save the government $325 million in outlays over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who will be hit hardest by this reduction of more than $300 million in expenditure over the next few years will be the battling families in this society. The lower income families will be the ones who will have their access to child care restricted by these decisions. They will not be able to afford child care beyond the 12 hours for which they will be awarded child-care assistance. This figure of 12 hours is a totally arbitrary figure. It has been plucked out of the air. It is not part of any strategy to deal with child care. It has been put there solely to provide the government with large savings to make up for the extraordinary level of financial mismanagement which we have seen from this government in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government desperately needed to bring back something that looked to the public like balance so it has clawed several hundred million dollars out of the pockets of the poorer people in our society&mdash;the battlers in the Australian society. However, there is no hesitation in extending the un-means-tested child-care cash rebate. Much of the responsibility for providing these child-care places, provided for under the government's previous schemes, has fallen on private child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the consequences of the decisions which have been taken in the budget, as members of the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations said earlier this week, is to throw into doubt the jobs of thousands of child-care workers who previously were providing child care to the children of these battling families. So not only are families damaged by these decisions but the job prospects of thousands of child-care workers, according to the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations, have now been put at risk by the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill really exemplifies the completely ad hoc nature of the government's approach to this whole child-care area. It is a matter which is causing increasing concern within the community as one decision after another makes child care less and less affordable for those people who have very little money in their pockets to spend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has consistently called for the development of child-care policies in full consultation with the whole range of different sectors of child care and not imposed by one group of interests on the other. It is quite clear that, instead of basing its policies&mdash;including the policies in this bill&mdash;on wide consultation, the government is simply looking at a series of short-term concerns and interests rather than giving families in Australia, and particularly the battling families, the opportunity to take advantage of policies within a settled and secure framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ill-conceived, poorly administered, ideologically driven policies and the lack of certainty and stability are having adverse impacts on poorer families in this community. This bill just further underlines the ad hoc nature of the decisions that are being made. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to speak in support of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995. This bill proposes amendments to a number of acts, including the Childcare Rebate Act 1993, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953, the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is my first speech in this chamber, the Main Committee, and I am pleased to be able to address my remarks today to two of my favourite policy areas, child care and health. The amendments to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993 are to ensure consistency with the intentions of the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme. Several amendments provide hardship provisions to assist certain groups of people who are currently excluded from the rebate scheme, but who should be eligible for the rebate. These groups include children over the age of 13 who have a disability or other special need which requires ongoing child care; carers under the age of 18 years who possess certain child-care qualifications; or parents who are currently unable to have work related commitments under section 39 because of extenuating circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of administrative issues and technical errors in the drafting of the act also require amendments. For example, amendments are needed to make consequential changes to bring the act into line with other Commonwealth legislation such as the Migration Act 1958; to allow the delegation of powers by the managing director of the Health Insurance Commission; to allow the minister some discretion over receipting requirements; and to strengthen powers to recover overpayments of the rebate. The amendments will also allow the suspension of family and carer registrations if cancellation of registrations is being considered. This will avoid unnecessary recoveries by the government while ensuring that individuals maintain their right to appeal against long-term decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further administrative amendments are proposed to allow the Health Insurance Commission to backdate carer registrations to the day on which they were first eligible to register; to cancel family and carer registrations which occurred due to administrative error; to ensure that the rebate is not paid for child-care costs which have been or will be reimbursed by another agent such as an employer; to clarify that the rebate is payable for child-care costs incurred for certain specified absences from care; to clarify the backdating of family registrations; to clarify the eligibility of overseas students to claim the rebate by amending the way courses of study are described; and to correct technical defects in the original act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care is one of the most important areas of social policy and economic policy that has been addressed by this Labor government. The number of government funded child-care places and the Commonwealth's commitment to child care have grown dramatically since the election of this government in 1983. In recognition of the increasing participation of women in the work force, the government has sought to provide quality, affordable child care through the various Commonwealth-state child-care agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care is a very important area of social justice, which is why I think it is such an important area. Because women are now quite rightly asserting their right to work, it becomes even more important. The lack of affordable, quality child care is indeed a barrier to many people, particularly women, who seek to enter the labour market. So that is why this Labor government sees that it is so important. Originally, child care was considered to be a welfare issue. To some extent, child care is still available for non-working parents through occasional care, but the main thrust of the federal government's children's services program is to do with employment related child care. The thrust is to provide access to the labour market for families with children so that one or both parents can access the work force. It is an economic need as well as a social justice issue. The priority of access guidelines in the child-care program ensure that priority is given to children whose parents are either working or seeking employment, and to groups with special needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has been very active in promoting work based child care, where an employer provides child care either at the workplace or elsewhere. In my former employment I was very active in setting up work based child care in a federal department. That seems to have gone pretty well. There is more of a trend towards providing work related and work based child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care program has had some difficulties with some state governments. It was interesting to listen to the previous speaker, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), criticising the government's child-care policies, saying that the government had had problems with its child-care policies and it was all ideologically driven. I am very proud to be part of a government that does have policies, particularly policies which are based on the ideology of access and equity, enabling people to enter the work force. I think it is a fair comment that the opposition does not seem to have many policies on anything at the moment, particularly on child care. I think it is one of the last areas that members of the opposition should criticise the government on because it is, after all, this government that has done so much to provide child care for Australian families in the last 12 years. </PARA>

It finally did so recently. Even worse than that, the previous New South Wales government did not sign the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement for 4 1/2 years. This was despite the fact that the previous Premier seemed to have forgotten the fact that he had not signed it and actually claimed during the election campaign that he had signed it until it was pointed out to him that that was not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to say that within weeks of coming into power the Carr Labor government has indeed signed the Commonwealth-state child-care agreement. So now the families of New South Wales, particularly areas with young populations and fast growing populations, like my electorate, can finally get access to the affordable, quality child care that they should have after having had to wait for nearly five years to access the places available under the Commonwealth-state child-care program. I do not think the opposition is in a very strong position to attack the government on child care of all things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area covered by the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) which I want to cover today relates to Medicare, and the enhancement of our universal health insurance system to provide access for all Australians to quality health care while at the same time keeping the costs of Medicare in check. The amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 correct a number of drafting errors and allow for the appointment as presidents of the Professional Services Review Tribunal of people who hold, or have held, judicial office in state and territory jurisdictions. This corrects an oversight in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 which, by not defining `judicial office', by virtue of section 21 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 prevented the appointment of current and former judicial office holders in jurisdictions other than that of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Health Insurance Commission Act also enable the commission to retain evidential material seized pursuant to the execution of a search warrant until the reason for seizure no longer exists or until a decision is made not to use it as evidence. That is a very important area, also. I have spoken at least two or three times in the House on this sort of issue, particularly on the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Act when it was first debated and passed by the House of Representatives. That arose out of concern about the tendency of some doctors&mdash;a minority of doctors&mdash;to abuse Medicare through overservicing or excessive servicing, which has been a problem that has been around for some time. The Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Act has been the best attempt so far to address that, providing the Health Insurance Commission with enhanced powers and clearer legislation to be able to combat overservicing by medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first public acknowledgment of the extent of medical fraud and overservicing came to light in February 1982, when the then opposition health spokesperson, Dr Blewett, revealed some information that had come from the health department stating that the extent of abuse of the pre-Medicare health system was up to $100 million a year. That was for the 1980-81 financial year, and $100 million then represented about seven per cent of the total Commonwealth medical benefits and fund benefits paid under the previous health system, so that was obviously of some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that, shortly after that revelation, documents from the Department of Health verified that that was an accurate estimate based on the very complex computer system known as the fraud and overservicing detection system, or FODS. The AMA supported that estimate when its actuaries had had a look at it. In those days, before Medicare, when the AMA was not trying to beat the Labor government around the head about Medicare, it was quite happy to support that estimate as being a true reflection of the extent of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That led to a Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquiry which was set up in February 1992 to inquire into medical fraud and overservicing. It is interesting that the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee at the time was the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). There was a rather amusing little article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> a couple of weeks ago stating that the honourable member for Bradfield and I had more in common than people might have realised. Apart from the fact that we both lost preselection on the same day, he was the chair of the committee which set up that inquiry, and the inquiry ultimately led to administrative arrangements which ended up meaning that I had a new job, back in 1984. Also, I was involved in presenting submissions to that inquiry in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Accounts Committee inquiry produced interim report No. 203 in December 1982, which was a fairly damning report on the administration by the Department of Health of the program which was supposed to curb abuses of the health insurance system as it was then. That resulted in the removal of the director-general of health and the resignation of the director in Victoria. Following hard on the heels of the Costigan report on tax avoidance, it was a fairly embarrassing report for the then Fraser government, which acted fairly quickly and put in some new administrative arrangements. They were put into place throughout 1983, after the election which changed the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984, the Labor government introduced Medicare, which changed things dramatically in the health insurance system. It brought in the universal health insurance system which survives and, in fact, thrives today. It is indeed the best and fairest and most equitable health system that Australia has ever had and, I would suggest, one which other countries, including the United States, look at with some envy. As I mentioned before, the AMA tended to change its attitude towards these issues after Medicare came in, although it had opposed it at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was working in the health department's surveillance investigation program then and we found that we were being undermined both from within the department, by some of the medicos who worked for the department, and also in the community. We were called `Big Brother' and all sorts of other names because we were starting to have some effect with the help of the FODS computer system that I mentioned. We were starting to produce reports, although slowly, because computerisation and technology were not what they are today in terms of timely reports and things. But we were starting to show some results which were potentially very embarrassing to sections of the medical profession, so we were targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What ended up happening was that there was a huge political bunfight over Medicare, with the surgeons in New South Wales going on strike. Part of the way that the dispute over Medicare was resolved was that, at a hearing of the Public Accounts Committee on 27 March 1985, the minister announced that our function of combating medical fraud and overservicing would be taken over by the Health Insurance Commission. That was meant to resolve a political problem. It was an understandable decision, though one that a lot of my work colleagues at the time did not agree with, and the commission then assumed responsibility for the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About seven years later, in late 1992, the Auditor-General's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit report No.17</EMPHASIS> was fairly scathing of the commission's work in this particular program. It suggested that the estimate of seven per cent of the total Medicare  benefits as the level of abuse&mdash;which had been mentioned in 1982 and never really discredited, although a lot of people had tried to do so&mdash;could still be valid at the time of that report, that is, in 1992. I mentioned in a speech on some health legislation in 1993 that, if it was still seven per cent, that would amount to over $300 million in 1992-93 terms. If it was still seven per cent today, it would be a lot more than that&mdash;it would be more than $350 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say, of course, that any government program that could possibly be put in place would ever recover $350 million. I am not suggesting that. That would be a bit like saying that if a million people a year broke the speed limit on the F5 freeway and were fined $150, you could recover $150 million. Of course, you would never catch all the people speeding, so you could never recover that much money. But I believe it is certainly an estimate of the level of abuse, although it is acknowledged that you could never possibly reduce that totally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 is the best attempt so far by any government to put in place measures to deal with this very important issue. It is very important because, as good as Medicare is, and as much as I support Medicare, it does cost a lot of money. It now costs over $5 billion a year in medical benefits schedule payments alone. That is a lot of money out of the budget and we need to make sure that the costs do not escalate any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of pressure in the community for Medicare to cover other types of health care, such as dental consultations, chiropractic, and everything else. There is a pretty good social justice argument for it to cover those areas: why should the medical profession have a monopoly over coverage under Medicare? But if you look at the economics of it, there is no way, politically, that you could justify extending Medicare benefits. It would simply cost too much money and it would not be very popular to stick the Medicare levy up to five per cent or something like that; it just would not be politically tenable for anyone to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is even more important that measures be put in place to prevent abuses of Medicare so the integrity of Medicare is protected and everybody can benefit. This legislation and certainly these amendments are very important to ensure that the professional review tribunal can operate and can be effective. I am hopeful that it will be more effective than the previous system with the medical services committees of inquiry. They were never very effective. They took years to resolve cases and, considering the potential number of cases, they looked only at a small number. The new system should work a lot better and these amendments to the legislation are very important in that system. I am pleased to be able to speak on this bill and I commend it to the Main Committee. </PARA>

The honourable member mentioned that child care is not a welfare issue, that it is too important. In fact, that is a discriminatory comment because certain parts of child care are treated as welfare issues in Australia. The Labor Party only discovered child care at the last election. I will talk about that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To recapitulate, the bill is an omnibus bill which covers the Childcare Rebate Act 1995, the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953&mdash;which was a good year&mdash;and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Most of the amendments proposed in this bill are lengthy but basically straightforward. I will be addressing my remarks exclusively to the child-care amendment and the whole issue of child care under this government and its departments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure people realise that there are four topics which should not be discussed at a dinner party. The first is religion. We have argued over this since time began. It has caused numerous holy wars; there are a couple going on at the moment in the world. It is best to avoid talking about it because the debate might break out about the hypocrisy of the faithful or the true believers, or, as they are now called, the few believers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other topic that should not be discussed at a dinner party is sex. It is not a topic to be talked about as people tuck into a hearty meal. People would also agree that politics is a no-no</PARA>
<PARA>topic for discussion at any dinner party. Lively debate normally follows any discussion on politics. Even the suggestion of the Prime Minister's name might bring forward colourful language. As I move into this particular field of endeavour, more and more I find that people either love or despise politicians, and usually despise is the case. However, I must comment that the former Prime Minister Bob Hawke is not controversial any more. I think everyone agrees about him these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fourth taboo topic that should not be discussed. If we were in the 1960s, it would probably be the Vietnam War. If we were in the 1970s, it would probably be nuclear energy. But we are in the 1990s. The taboo subject not to be discussed at dinner parties these days is child care. It can, of course, be discussed at great length, but only if the child-care situation of all the other guests at the dinner party has been tactfully sussed out. Unfortunately, we have to work out where we stand on this very contentious issue before we can freely talk about it. It is a bit like politics: people either love it or hate it. The reason child care is so contentious these days is that it is, in fact, politics. Child-care is no longer a simple matter of deciding what best suits your family needs and aspirations. Child care is no longer a matter of choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have to weigh up our desires as parents against a powerful system of carrots and sticks aimed at channelling parents into becoming two-income families. The Childcare Rebate Act is part of the process. Parents are subtly and not so subtly being told that, if they are at home with their children these days, they are just not cutting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the business of nurturing a child is now some sort of hobby, that it is a pleasant way to spend one's leisure but not really worth while. This is the line being pushed by the Labor feminist lobby of recent times. Ms Eva Cox, the convener of the Women's Economic Think Tank, social policy analyst and spokesperson for the New South Wales Women's Electoral Lobby, recently stated on the ABC radio program the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people who benefit from having a woman at home is the man, not the community, not necessarily the children. I mean, it's very nice having time off with your kids . . . but it is not something which has a clear public benefit, it's a private benefit, and it ought to be seen as such.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Cox has lost touch with reality and has no concept of what it is to fully nurture a child, to have an interdependent relationship. Clearly she does not recognise that having children is something which does and should require adjustments to one's life and sacrifices of one's own desires to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The men Ms Cox so scathingly sees as the beneficiaries in such a family arrangement, like most of the single-income families of today, sacrifice considerable wealth by agreeing to work as a team in partnership with their spouse and support the mother of their children at home. Apparently this point is totally disregarded by Ms Cox. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And does the working mother always benefit? It seems all too often the working mother ends up under the strain of having two full-time jobs, all the while feeling torn between the two.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children are not a pleasant accessory to one's life. For most parents they become the focus of and the real purpose to their lives. Yet this attitude that parents share is continually derided by people like Ms Cox and those opposite pushing the same sort of line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure honourable members are aware that these days many families are under pressure both financially and socially to have both parents in the paid work force. Now that the taxation assessment system for most families has no recognition whatsoever of the dependants being supported by the wage earner in a single-income family, some families are doing it rather tough. The government has finally recognised this difficulty by introducing their latest bandaid, a one-off payment on the birth of one's child. It is just about enough to cover the extraordinary bill from the obstetrician, but then people are left on their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents at home now receive the home child-care allowance, which is about to pass into history and be re-configured as the parenting allowance. The point I am trying to make is that the payment comes from the social security system and, therefore, could be interpreted as saying that families with a parent caring for children at home are a burden on the taxpayer. The government clearly agrees, because it calls the most natural child care `welfare' as it pays it through the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Childcare Rebate Act allows double-income parents to receive child-care fee relief and, if their income exceeds the means test maximum, they can also receive the child-care cash rebate. This is considered by the government as an entitlement. The previous speaker alluded to that as well, saying that it is an entitlement for working parents but not an entitlement for single-income families, and that single-income families are welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care is considered a work-related expense by the government. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and her junior, the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), were indignant in their defence of the payment, insisting it is quite different from welfare. It is a work-related expense, they say. It is also non-means tested. Assuming that it is a work-related expense, then surely the single-income family with a spouse caring for children at home should be considered a work-related expense. After all, if one spouse, usually the mother, did not give up paid employment to look after the children, surely the other spouse would have to. Maybe child care is not seen as a co-parental responsibility. Maybe it is seen as a woman-only responsibility by the government&mdash;it seems that could be the case&mdash;or maybe parental child care is not considered as legitimate as formal child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Choice for Families group when it says that child care is not a work related expense; and it seems the tax department agrees too. Child care is, in fact, a cost of having children. Whether parents relinquish an income to do this so-called work themselves or pay someone else to do it, it is a cost of having children. The cost is incurred because one has children that must be cared for. It is the very existence of children whose needs must be met that requires financial sacrifice. The choice as to how best to meet those needs should be made by families, not coerced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies of the government, and legislation like the act we are amending today, are placing artificial divisions between families according to the decisions they are making in relation to child care and child rearing. I could have said that these families are making choices about child care, but for some families there is no real choice. For instance, if families are living in rural areas, there is no real choice about child care. If a family has a child with a disability, there is no real choice, although this amendment does address the eligibility for rebate for some of those families. If a family has a multiple birth, there is no real choice. If a family cannot survive on one income, there is no real choice. If parents believe that nurturing their own children is the only way to parent, then there really is no choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this government, so full of platitudes and rhetoric about families, appears to place greater value on the choice to become a two-income family. It seems that child rearing is only a legitimate occupation if one pays someone else to do it. If parents do this work themselves, then the time it takes, the energy and the skill all disappear, and such parents are seen by many as being in a mindless state of dreaming along at home with no real work to do. The truth is that these parents are working at providing&mdash;with the love of a parent, which no centre can provide&mdash;all that is needed to nurture children. They are providing a safe environment, nutrients, stimulation, rest, life experience, opportunities for conceptual formation and, of vital importance, bonding: a long-term relationship of commitment to that particular child. It can be unglamorous work, requiring a hardy self-image and given no social recognition, yet many parents feel they must do it. They endure it because it is of a vital importance to them. Yet, for doing so, they are deemed non-working, and their contribution is totally disregarded by people like Ms Cox and those that determine Labor Party policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is an alternative to this. One can use paid child care. That is to be high quality care, and that should be so. We must surely provide the best care for our nation's children, because our children are our future. Support services are being put in place, and rightly so. There are well targeted subsidies and fee relief to assist families with the cost of child care, and rightly so. No-one argues against it. But there should be a balance. This provision should not be at the expense of those who provide child care at home. Support services should be balanced and equally provided to families who chose both paths or either path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families that provide child care should not be treated as welfare recipients, and should be given the opportunity of lifting their status. They are treated as welfare recipients, yet they pay for the social security system. The child care debate is discriminating against those families that provide their own child care, and this should not be so. Government policies are creating nice little boxes for families, but the fact is that most families do not fit these nice little boxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many parents of families are neither fully at home nor fully in the work force. Child-care arrangements will always change as the child grows, yet the government does not seem to recognise this sort of diversity. For instance, parents who chose shift work in order to do their own child care get neither the parenting allowance nor the child-care cash rebate. Those that share a job miss out. In my electorate I have a couple of teachers who are parents and who share a job&mdash;one works two days and the other works three days&mdash;so they can look after their family. They miss out, while some on extremely high incomes get support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of child care is complex and costly, and it is also discriminatory and entirely confusing. It is time we had a look at the way we provide support for families. We should be treating their welfare, in particular the welfare of children, as the real priority. It is time we developed an approach to family support that recognises the diversity of families without seeking to socially engineer their child-care choices, as this Labor government does and would have us do. It means that the government is really into social engineering. It brings these policies forward to get elected, and then it does not understand the ramifications of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of our nation relies heavily on the health and wellbeing of our children. It is truly unfortunate that children do not figure too much in government legislation. Too often money does, but children do not. Too often the ALP tosses money at problems and hopes that solutions can be found; it does not actually go back to the core and prevent. It is clear in the matter of child care that the government has in fact got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendments to this bill, and I call for an urgent review into our nation's child-care policy and legislation. I give notice that I will be moving a motion, and in fact I will be writing to the chairman of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs asking for an inquiry into child-care policy. If in fact this cannot be done in the term of this particular government, because an election is now due, I am sure that the Liberal Party will do it once we are in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party really is the party that is working for the family. In particular we are taking on board this child-care issue as one of the most important issues affecting the community. In fact, in marginal seats like mine I can say that it will be an issue at the next election. Unfortunately the Labor Party has not recognised this; it tries to discriminate between stay-at-home parents and working parents; it is trying to force parents back into the work force, and that is not good for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just give a little anecdote before I finish, Mr Deputy Speaker. The other day I went to a child-care centre. A three-month-old baby was lying in a pram by itself. There was a cold wind, but it was lying there goo-goo-gaaing and all that sort of stuff. I went over and stroked its face. It responded immediately; it wanted to touch, it wanted to play. This child was one of 15 children, some of whom were in a sandpit, which the child carer was looking after at the time. This three-months-old child has been at this child-care centre since it was six weeks old. </PARA>

I have actually seen him eat them; I do not know what they tasted like. In fact, the active ingredient is egg. Without egg, which apparently provides nutrients to the skin, his products are ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Czarniack was fined $96,000. Why was he fined that amount of money when the act did not define food? That is what his products were. The only thing was that, although Mr Czarniack ate it, the product was wiped onto the skin. At least that was what was suggested. Why, for his putting egg into his product, were Mr Czarniack's home, his pharmacy and his parents' home raided by 11 Federal Police officers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Mr Czarniack's biggest problems was that there were no secrecy provisions. He had invented a product, but if he registered it with the TGA it would reveal its contents. I am informed that a large pharmaceutical company lodged the complaint against Mr Czarniack simply because he was offering competition. Now a small businessman is $96,000 worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point worth noting is that, while the TGA rules that his products are therapeutic for the purposes of its act, the tax department views them as cosmetic so that it can hit him with a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. Mr Czarniack was advancing to the stage of exporting his products. Now, because of a poorly drafted law, a minister acting at the behest of a large pharmaceutical company and the fear of those companies of competition, he is back to being a struggling small businessman. The Therapeutic Goods Administration stands condemned for its refusal to share intelligent dialogue with Mr Czarniack and, instead, hunting him to issue a massive fine of $96,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that these amendments would assist Mr Czarniack any more but I hope that highlighting this particular case brings to the government's attention the concerns of small inventors who have innocently gone about their business, have not mixed a chemical or lethal cocktail of any kind but have been harassed and abused by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. We might just remember that for one egg a constituent of mine was raided by 11 federal police and fined $96,000. That is appalling and it is also fairly stupid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The news last night had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) looking at recent inventions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and also the honourable members for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), Goldstein (Dr Kemp), Macarthur (Mr Haviland), Stirling (Mr Cameron) and Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) for their contribution to this debate. Also I thank the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Chisholm, for his overall endorsement of this package of much needed legislation. I note the shadow minister's comments about increased industry involvement in the aged care industry. On behalf of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) I spend a lot of time with nursing home proprietors and workers, opening various nursing homes and hostels all over the country, and most importantly with nursing home and hostel residents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the correct arrangements are those that put the residents first, as they should be. The government is similarly concerned to protect the rights of consumers and to maintain confidence in the provision of nursing home care and especially personal care in nursing homes. Indeed, this is one of the clear aims of the amendments to the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome standards were developed as a direct result of wide consultation. The booklet <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living in a nursing home</EMPHASIS>, which was published in 1987, contained the material which subsequently led to the minister making standards under section 45D of the National Health Act 1953. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister mentioned several cases or accusations that the enforcement of outcome standards has been inconsistent and sometimes harsh. It is true that several complaints have been lodged with the Commonwealth Ombudsman. However, it should be pointed out that, up to this point, no such complaints have been upheld by the Ombudsman. Professor Braithwaite from the ANU reported on a study done into the reliability and validity of nursing home standards in 1991, on 50 standards monitoring team visits in New South Wales and Victoria, involving some 30 teams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, Professor Braithwaite found that outcome standards could be monitored both consistently and with validity. Some degree of inconsistency was found to have existed in the variation in the standards met between the states, but we are remedying that. In response to Professor Braithwaite's reports, the government has introduced a national consistency strategy to ensure variations are kept to a minimum. The strategy includes: national training for standards monitors; exchanges between monitors from different states; holding national standards workshops; compliance sheets and statements being selectively explained and reviewed between central and states offices; staff attending standard review days in different states; and maintenance and analysis of a database holding information on each visit to nursing homes and hostels, which allows analysis of textural justifications being given for reining in problem standards. These initiatives were positively acknowledged in Professor Braithwaite's 1993 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Raising the standards</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those comments in response to the shadow minister's statement about consistency. In other words, we were already aware of this issue and have already acted on it, so he is a bit behind in his comments in relation to that matter. But I would hope that he would take on board what has already been done and what is being done. On the question of peer review, the government is not clear what the opposition actually means by the reference to peer review in relation to the regulation of outcome standards. On the one hand, the opposition states that it supports consumer confidence in the provision of care in nursing homes, yet when faced with the example of nursing homes where these standards are not met, it can only suggest that peer review will somehow remedy the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to just issue a warning about peer review. It is all very well to say that we should allow this industry, in a sense, to regulate itself. But it was found in other areas of government that, if we allow too much freedom in this area, we will end up with a situation where cases that should be controlled are not. That is one of the big issues. The opposition appears to be unaware of the present involvement of the nursing home industry in the review of standards. Each state and territory has a standards review panel which is set up under section 45E of the National Health Act 1953. These panels consider appeals from nursing home proprietors who are dissatisfied with the departmental assessments. Each panel has an industry representative, together with a consumer representative. Accordingly, a significant level of peer review already exists, but, as I said, it has to be measured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn now to the comments of the member for Goldstein. The government does have a policy, a strong commitment and a proud record in relation to child care. I thought it was quite extraordinary to hear him talking about ideologically driven policy on child care when he has been the representative for many years, both in the academic world and the political world, of the most ideologically driven philosophy that has occurred in this country and, indeed, in the whole of the Western world in the last 40 years. I am referring to the New Right, Thatcherite philosophy of which he has been one of the prominent spokespersons and one of the prominent supporters. So, coming from the member for Goldstein, that was a bit rich!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me say very clearly: the government's policies in relation to child care are based on a comprehensive assessment of the way in which we need to meet needs of people&mdash;real needs, of real people. It is based on a philosophy, yes. But the philosophy is one that is generally accepted by the vast proportion of the Australian community, and I refer to the social justice principles. Those social justice principles are the very principles we have been trying to talk members of the opposition into ever since they went into opposition in 1983. They still seem incapable of understanding that the Australian community is committed to and interested in social justice principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, having said that, can we just give a few facts about child care? Since 1983, funded places have increased from 46,000 to over 250,000 as at December 1994. The government has made a commitment to meet demand for work related child care by 2001. Similarly, expenditure has increased from $65 million in 1992-93 to an estimated&mdash;listen to this, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;$1.53 billion in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Affordability of child care has also been enhanced by the introduction of child-care assistance and by extending the number of eligible families; the implementing of the child-care cash rebate which recognised child-care costs as a legitimate expense of working; and the implementation of quality improvement and accreditation. Having said all that, I wish to reiterate that the 1995 budget continues the government's commitment to families, with continued substantial growth in children's services programs that were approved and the targeting of the program for working families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget also recognises the need for occasional care by providing 12 hours per child per week for development sessions. The member for Goldstein tried to make this into a negative. Instead of a positive, he tried to make it into a negative. The further recognition of occasional child care was made into a negative. What an extraordinary statement from an opposition which wanted, prior to the last election, to cut billions of dollars off social programs and which now refuses to tell the people what it wants to do, refuses to state any policy because everyone knows that the moment it states its social policies it will involve substantial cuts in areas such as child care. I thought that the speech of the honourable member, given his record and his ideological predilections, was amazing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rebate, of course, is part of the government's ongoing commitment to assist families with work related child care. The rebate is not means tested, consistent with the practice of not means testing the work-related concessions. At 29 May 1995, 244,000 families had registered for the cash rebate and 201,000 had claimed a rebate. New registrations are running at 2,000 a week. There is evidence that many families have not yet established a regular claiming pattern, but we are hoping that they will do so. Amendments will address issues which have arisen since the establishment of the scheme in 1994 and will strengthen the rebate scheme. There is certainly nothing wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the member for Cowan, the government's support for the child-care cash rebate is part of this government's continuing commitment to assist families with children. The rebate is part of a comprehensive package of assistance for families whatever their employment circumstances. These payments include family payments, current home child-care allowance and the new parenting allowance, maternity allowance and, of course, child-care assistance. This package of payments responds to work force participation patterns which suggest that today most women will spend some time in the paid work force and some time at home caring for their children. The government believes that the policies in place are appropriate and beneficial whilst offering a real choice for all women, whether at home or in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I also say that I am advised that the member for Stirling's claims are not entirely accurate. The case he referred to is an emotive one and subject to much publicity. Mr Czarniack has pursued his claims on appeal through all avenues. We, of course, encourage that and, where people have a just case, we look at it. I am not in a position to further comment on this case, but I can say that the government is always open to considering cases where there are allegations of injustice in the delivery of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, in your comments as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro you asked for the consideration of a particular drug involved in the treatment of various mental illnesses&mdash;I think it was Clozapine&mdash;and whether or not we can look into the question of the provision of that drug without people having to go to a hospital with a psychiatrist. I will take up this matter with the minister and will respond to you at the appropriate time once I have a response from the minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The bill amends defence legislation for the following purposes: to enable senior acting appointments to be made at ministerial level rather than by the Governor-General; to replace provisions under which officers hold their appointments at the Governor-General's pleasure; to implement recommendations of the Defence Force Discipline Legislation Board of Review; to extend the home loan assistance application deadline for a limited group of former members; and to ensure that the military superannuation and benefits scheme complies with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. I will deal with these matters in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment will enable the appointment of officers to act as the Chief of the Defence Force, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force or as the chief of staff of an arm of the Defence Force to be made by the minister rather than the Governor-General. This will streamline the procedure and remove an unnecessary administrative burden on the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of amendments concerns retirement and termination of appointments. At present the Defence Act, the Naval Defence Act and Air Force Regulations provide that officers hold their appointment at the Governor-General's pleasure. Under the existing provisions, officers could be retired or have their appointments terminated at any time and on any grounds or for no grounds at all. The Defence Force is the last major Commonwealth career group subject to the concept of holding office at pleasure. This concept is no longer appropriate to a career service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Defence Act and the Naval Defence Act replace the current blanket provisions with provisions that specify the grounds on which an officer can be retired early or have an appointment terminated. The amendments also introduce specific procedures for the management initiated early retirement of officers and enable the promotion of senior officers on limited tenure where they accept a promotion on that condition. Corresponding amendments will be made to the Air Force Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these amendments will give the defence organisation management flexibility, they also increase the level of protection available to affected officers. Under the proposed provisions an officer could only be retired early or have an appointment terminated where one of the specified grounds is made out, or where the officer is subject to the management initiated early retirement procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where appropriate, an officer to be retired early or have an appointment terminated would be given the reasons in writing for the proposed action and an opportunity to show cause why it should not proceed. The main exception would be where the period of fixed term appointment had expired, often referred to as a short service commission. Affected officers would also have the right to lodge an application for redress of grievance under the Defence Force Regulations and are entitled to submit a complaint with the Defence Force Ombudsman. Similar safeguards apply to the management initiated early retirement procedures. In addition, I emphasise that management initiated early retirement would only occur after all attempts to redeploy or retrain an affected officer had been exhausted and would be accompanied by the offer of a financial package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third group of amendments is to the Defence Force Discipline Act, which provides a scheme of discipline for all members of the Defence Force. The legislation came into operation, provision was made for a board of review to review its operations after three years. The board found that the scheme was generally adequate but made a number of recommendations to enhance its operation. These proposed amendments to the act would achieve this and also bring the act into line with the Commonwealth Crimes Act provisions for the investigation of offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the key amendments are those which enable the appointment of discipline officers to deal with minor infringements of discipline. The board found that the present procedures for dealing with minor infractions are unnecessarily complex and administratively burdensome. A discipline officer will have the power to decide, with a minimum of formality, matters which do not have any element of criminality and to impose minor punishments. These will not carry the stigma of a criminal conviction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should emphasise that the discipline officer will only be able to deal with uncontested matters and a person who wishes to defend the matter will have the right to a full hearing under the provisions of the Defence Force Discipline Act. Where an accused person does wish to have the case handled by a discipline officer, there will be no entitlement to representation but the right to call evidence in mitigation of punishment will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three new offences are created: unlawful discharge of a weapon, and refusal to submit to a medical examination or supply a specimen where a medical examination is being carried out as part of the investigation of a service offence. The latter offences will obviously assist the prosecution of offences involving drug abuse. The Defence Force has in place a firm no drugs policy and the maximum penalty for use and possession of cannabis is to be increased from a fine equivalent to seven days pay to a fine of 14 days pay for a first offence and dismissal from the Defence Force for a subsequent offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sentencing options for minor offences will be enhanced by introducing the punishment of extra drill, to a maximum of three hours spread over three days, increasing the maximum period of extra duties from three to seven days, and enabling suspension of the payment of all fines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently members of the Defence Force who are suspended from duty pending the investigation of an alleged offence or suspended while awaiting trial for a civil or criminal offence are entitled to payment of salary and allowances. This entitlement will be removed where a suspended member has been charged with an offence. Such a member will, however, be entitled to engage in employment outside the Defence Force during the period of suspension. These changes will parallel the provisions applying to the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act will streamline existing procedures for the conduct of investigations and hearings conducted by service tribunals and bring certain provisions in the act, such as those dealing with confessions, into line with current Commonwealth Crimes Act provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Act to overcome a defect in the administration of the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme. In 1992 the act was amended to provide access to the home loans scheme to persons who first enlisted in the Defence Force after 14 May 1985 and were discharged because of a compensable disability before 15 May 1991, provided these persons applied for an entitlement certificate by 1 September 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the changes to the act were publicised widely through service and ex-service channels at the time, it was nevertheless considered that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to attempt to contact every former member who might benefit and who might otherwise not become aware of the benefit. Unfortunately, some former members received late advice of the changes. As a result, some 17 applicants were debarred because the cut-off date of 1 September 1994 for lodging applications had already passed. Accordingly, the bill extends the time limit from 1 September to 1 December 1994, so that these persons will not be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendments made by the bill are to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act. This act establishes the current superannuation scheme for members of the Defence Force. The amendments will allow the military superannuation and benefits scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which provides for enhanced prudential supervision of superannuation funds. The amendments are of a technical nature and relate to the decision making powers and roles of the board of trustees and the minister. They are similar to amendments made last year to the superannuation legislation relating to Commonwealth civilian schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act requires, among other things, that the trustees of superannuation entities not be subject to direction by any person and that the approval of the trustees must be obtained for any change to the governing rules of the scheme. In the case of the military superannuation and benefits scheme, the governing rules would include the trust deed and regulations. The amendments remove the present requirement for the trustees to have regard to statements of government policy in exercising their functions, and provide that financial statements be in a form agreed between the board of trustees and the minister, and require the agreement of the board of trustees to any changes to the trust deed or the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will appreciate from my comments on the individual measures that this legislation is essentially part of the ongoing process of improving and modernising the administration of the Defence Force. With this in mind, I look forward to the House's support for the legislation. It is not expected to have a significant financial impact. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We could talk very happily about the degree to which respect needs to be shown by members of the government to the House, including by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Had they shown respect, and did they show respect, I would treat the intervention with a little more good humour than I do. There is an aspect that members of the government need to recognise, and that is that attendance in this chamber is not counted as attendance in the main chamber. In other words, if you are present here in the Main Committee, even if you make a contribution&mdash;as Minister Punch, who has just made his second reading speech, has made his contribution here&mdash;but you do not at any time this day attend in the main chamber, then you will not be noted as being present in parliament. It therefore seems quite ridiculous to me that somebody who is not allowed to be in the main chamber is apparently not allowed to be here in the Main Committee, even though his presence here is not counted as his being present there. It is just one of those little things which strikes me as being slightly ridiculous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that I wanted to make is really quite significant. I know the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) is on the Procedure Committee. It is important that ministers' second reading speeches, as we now know them, be made part of the first reading rather than the second reading process. I believe it would be very helpful, in most instances, for second reading speeches&mdash;such as that which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) has just given and which we are now about to consider&mdash;to in fact be presented at the time of introduction of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several aspects to this, not the least being that, as all members are aware, the courts now take into account a minister's second reading speech in interpreting the context of a bill. So that there can be more informed debate, I think it is appropriate that that second reading speech become a first reading speech, and that time be allocated for that purpose in the main chamber&mdash;or here in the Main Committee if that is where it is being presented, as it is in this instance&mdash;so that there can be some knowledge of the purpose and content of the bill. I put those recommendations forward for serious consideration in matters unrelated to this particular debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is an interesting bill. I am always fascinated by ministerial rhetoric, so I was glad to hear that it is part of the government's `ongoing process of improving and modernising the administration of the Defence Force'. Pardon me if I am slightly cynical about the degree to which that can be said to apply to these amendments. However, I will look at the bill in detail, and then come back and comment upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certainly aspects of the amendments which concern me. Indeed, I wonder whether it is not part of a wider political agenda which includes starving the Defence Force of funds in certain directions. I think that is quite seriously affecting the morale and good humour of those in uniform in a way which does not appeal to me, nor do I think it is for the nation's good. I am concerned about the extent to which some of these amendments do not seem to contribute towards the better management of the defence service, but contribute to the containment of blow-outs in expenditure and premature redundancy rather than anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has indicated, the package covers a number of other individual pieces of legislation in respect of the services. He identified the principal content of the bill. I want to go through each section. As I have said, in spite of my cynicism about the purpose of the legislation, the opposition will not be opposing it, although there are aspects of it about which I am concerned. I would like to get some response from the minister in due course, if I may. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes with respect to the Military Superannuation Benefits Act no doubt make sense. They are in line with other changes. I certainly see no reason for them not to be approved. Similarly, the change to the deadline within the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act makes sense. I am appalled that apparently 17 people did not receive notice in time. I wonder how and why. In fact, in other circumstances individuals have had great difficulty in getting any response from the Defence Force on a number of issues. It concerns me that letters to the services are not replied to in time or are not replied to at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard it as ordinary good practice in office administration to answer letters. I know of a number of instances where letters have not been answered by the Defence Force, and in this instance apparently 17 letters were not posted in time. Whatever the reason, it is not administratively efficient and, while it might be a bit of a leap, it strikes me that if people are incompetent in doing little things then they are not necessarily competent in doing big things. It is unfortunate that a change has to be made to legislation simply because these letters were not posted in time to enable those applicants to take advantage of this particular change to the home loans assistance legislation. In any event, the opposition does not oppose the measure included within this bill to extend the time limit from 1 September to 1 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amendment of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, I am sure that all those who are serving are delighted to know that they will be able to get their punishment of extra drill to only a maximum of three hours spread over three days. I think that that sounds like a far more rational treatment than some that one can recall. I must admit that if one goes back to the days of Nelson, rum, sodomy and the lash it is significantly better. I am glad to know that at least in some things we have improved the lot of those in uniform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that we have shown a little more care and concern than you have shown at times, my friend. That is part of the problem. My cynicism is based on experience of deteriorating morale and reduced capacity in training. We are having these new Collins class submarines built but I gather that at the very best we are going to be able to man three of them. It rather concerns me that the same applies to the PC3s, the long range maritime patrol aircraft, and to the FA18s. I certainly do not think we are providing enough funds at the sharp end of the services to keep people trained. That is a bit of a diversion but the opposition does not oppose that part of the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice in the minister's second reading speech a phrase that I just wanted to comment on. I would appreciate it if he could respond. He may not be able to do so at the moment but I think it would be worth checking. In his second reading speech&mdash;and I did not check it in the bill&mdash;he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . members of the Defence Force who are suspended from duty pending the investigation of an alleged offence or suspended while awaiting trial for a civil or criminal offence are entitled to the payment of salary and allowances.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this is to be removed. My concern is that that person should go through some type of a preliminary hearing before being denied payment. I do not see suspension in an arbitrary fashion as necessarily judging that person guilty. In the services as much as in the civilian community a person is considered innocent until proved guilty. If there is an arbitrary suspension I do not believe a denial of payment of salary and allowances is appropriate. While I accept this form and I am not going to dispute it I think that some preliminary process to determine the suspension is appropriate. I do not know whether departmental people have that kind of power over the uniformed services anyway but I think that a quasi-judicial process is very important&mdash;it might be a mini court-martial; it might be a matter of the officer responsible taking evidence&mdash;but there needs to be some process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that person is denied salary and allowances it is also of concern to me that service people, because of the location of the particular facility where they are operating, might be a long way from employment. We all know the difficulties that spouses have in getting employment when they are transferred, for example, from Victoria to Queensland. A nurse or a teacher often finds it hard to even get registration in that state. If such people are going to be denied the continued pay and allowances, I do not know whether that includes their housing. So there are aspects to it which I think need to be looked at. It is arbitrary and quite different from provisions applying to the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A public servant is normally in a place for a lot longer in an environment where he or she and the spouse can work reasonably if there is work available. Such people are not entirely dependent upon the establishment but those in uniform have problems of location and the availability of jobs. The way I read this measure at the moment it could be too arbitrary, and I have reservations about it for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, I think it essential that there be a preliminary hearing of a quasi-judicial nature which will ensure that there will be no arbitrary denial of natural justice to the person accused, nor a denial of that person's presumption of innocence, until such stage at least as there has been a consideration, because it is applying a penalty which in some instances could be extraordinarily severe. This is particularly so because many members of the defence forces really are denied the opportunity for both spouses to work; in other words, they are virtually in a single income family environment as distinct from the dual income that is now far more the common practice around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are consequences of those changes which I think might well need review. I accept that they flow from recommendations of a committee. I know that there is the Defence Force Discipline Appeal Tribunal, but I am just a little concerned at those two aspects of it. If those matters cannot be answered now, I would appreciate the minister having a look at them&mdash;that is, a quasi-judicial hearing, and an assurance that people will not be unduly disadvantaged because of the fact that people in uniform are a long way from normal facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on. We come then to replacing the existing provisions of the Defence Act under which officers hold their appointments at the Governor-General's pleasure. I accept that there is certainly a reason to try to change from a system which really is perhaps a little antiquated and one which is certainly not appropriate to career service, using the minister's language. I am concerned, however, at several aspects of this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment is designed to streamline procedure and remove an unnecessary administrative burden for the Governor-General. I am worried about the degree to which, if we are going to make people subject to definable terms, the government will use this newly introduced, management-initiated early retirement as, as one serviceman put it to me, an alternative redundancy scheme, because that would certainly be totally unacceptable. It should not be an early redundancy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there are problems which in part flow because the number of senior vacancies now available may not be as great. The changes to be introduced are perhaps directed more to that than to the reason given in the minister's second reading speech. But I do have a worry that, in the character of the legislative change, it could be that people will be prejudiced by not receiving what I would see as a normal progression of appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems that flow, no doubt, from the limited opportunities for service at a senior officer level. I know many positions that were previously available for a person of a two-star rank are now being downgraded to a one-star rank, and of course one-star appointments are now reduced to a colonel equivalent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In good industrial relations practice, were these people members of the bureaucracy, I am not too sure that they would be very taken by this type of enforced, management-initiated early retirement. I know there are forms of redundancy and that it all sounds great when you put a few more descriptive phrases around it, but I am just a bit suspicious of the industrial good practice that this represents. I note what the minister said. I accept that the services are now career services in a form that perhaps some might have said they were once not, although I doubt that anybody who served in the past would see them in that way. I accept that there is more management flexibility, but I am a little concerned about the way it is being introduced and the consequences of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several aspects of this first amendment which enable the appointment of officers to act as Chief of the Defence Force, Vice-Chief of the Defence Force or as the chief of staff of an arm of the Defence Force to be made by a minister rather than the Governor-General. I am very apprehensive about any change that removes the Executive Council right and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Executive Council is largely an unknown body as far as most members of the public are concerned. It is a group that does not necessarily achieve the publicity that ministers attract. If a regulation is passed or a particular appointment is made, it is the inevitable consequence that people note&mdash;whatever is passed or the person appointed&mdash;rather than the procedure that enacts it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all ministers are well aware, even attending Executive Council for some can be seen as something of a burden. But Executive Council is as important a part of our democratic system as cabinet or as any other facet of ministerial responsibility. Within Executive Council, where there always needs to be at least three persons present, it is possible for appointments to be questioned. It is possible for an entirely independent person, the Governor-General, or, if he is not present, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to pass judgment on the particular merit of a recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as you remove that power and make something subject to a minister's fiat then it creates a little bit of a difficulty. I say that because the minister, obviously, is going to have his prejudices. The minister may not be, with all the goodwill in the world, acting necessarily in what some would see as a dispassionate and independent way. I have long felt that appointments by the Executive Council have a great advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the minister's argument is that this change is going to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . streamline the procedure and remove an unnecessary administrative burden on the Governor-General</PARA>
<PARA>However, I suggest that that is one of the reasons why we have Governors-General, to exercise that administrative burden, to act as the President of the Executive Council and to be able to provide a bit of dispassionate judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that those who are keen advocates of the republican cause might say, `Well, it shouldn't be for a Governor-General, it should be for a President.' Whatever the form of government there needs to be an executive council and the Executive Council is a group which can judge dispassionately a minister's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our system, sadly, more often than not there is more effective scrutiny at Executive Council level than there can be in the parliament. That is because so often decisions are taken at executive level which even the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) may not be aware of. I know that there are not too many that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) does not consult him on but there are probably a number of areas where I suspect that the Governor-General might be advised to a greater degree. In those circumstances I suspect that it is advantageous to have an Executive Council determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the change and note that it is going to be by appointment by the minister. I know it is only an acting appointment&mdash;I know all those thingsabout it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also another aspect, another one of my concerns that has been there for a while. It is now part of the system. It is the pecking order and the way it is listed that I am not particularly happy about. You will note the order, and the minister has impeccably put them in the correct order. He mentions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.. the Chief of the Defence Force, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force or as the chief of staff of an arm of the Defence Force</PARA>
<PARA>In days gone by this is something that would have snuck in. A few years ago the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force was the most junior of the three stars in the services, and as far as I am concerned he still should be. As minister I pushed the joint service idea within the services and I still think it is the way to go. But there is a problem because of the way in which individual service chiefs are now relegated in the scheme of things behind the general dictates of wearing a purple uniform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remain to be convinced that there is merit in promoting the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force to the exalted status of being No. 2 in the pecking order. I believe he or she should still be behind the individual chiefs of the arms of the Defence Force, although I know that the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) and the honourable member for Moncrieff probably, like me, wait with interest for the day when we will have a woman in any one of those positions. No doubt the day will come. Because of the time, perhaps that might be a debate we could have on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other aspects that I want to mention briefly. There is, with respect to the Defence Force Discipline Act, one other change which I did not address and that is the new offences created. Firstly, there is the offence of unlawful discharge of a weapon. I have no doubt that there have been a number of instances which have promoted that particular change, and I believe that change is desirable. Secondly, I wanted to address the offence of refusing to submit to a medical examination or supply a specimen. This is an interesting change. The question of the degree to which there is a capacity to be able to enforce the testing of people for AIDS in the ordinary civilian community is a matter of some public debate. I am one of those who believes that, given the consequences for the person providing professional health care, there is an advantage in having obligatory testing. I know that in this instance it is said to be because of the no drugs policy in the Defence Force, a policy which I totally endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a procedure and practice which really does have considerable merit in the assessment of whether or not a person is subject to AIDS, as much as to whether or not a person is subject to drugs. It worries me that in the community at large, health carers can be exposed unnecessarily to the possible consequences of treating people, simply because they are unaware that their patients may be subject to AIDS or to other highly contagious diseases. Indeed, Ebola, another one of those very contagious diseases which has been tragically apparent in Zaire recently, is something that we all note with horror and we trust it will never appear in Australia. That particular change to the legislation is important and is certainly to be endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding my response to the legislation, there were two things that I really wanted to say. Firstly, I am concerned about the management initiated early retirement and limited tenure appointment conditions. I see them as being introduced not because of good management to the services, but because of the way in which manpower generally is being restricted within the defence vote, in order to acquire new equipment and to maintain a modern defence force. Nobody can deny that it is essential. Nobody can deny that, in the nature and character of trying to ensure that the ADF is able to meet any contingency, we should spend a significant amount of money on re-equipment. My worry is that there also is a need to maintain a balance between the funds provided at the manpower and training end and the equipment end. I am not happy with the present situation in the services. There are a number of areas that need to be modified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one of those who remain to be convinced that the ready reserve is the way to go. I was taken by a speech made by a very distinguished former major-general in the Australian Defence Force, Mike Jeffery, only last week. He was talking of the extent to which we could commit those 3,700 regular soldiers who leave the army each year to a part-time commitment of seven days service annually for five years. I am impressed by the idea of utilising the skills of those who retire, particularly those who are still in an age bracket where they are can make a contribution. We need to use those people to a greater degree than we do now. I would like to see such a group being able to transfer into the reserves in a more appropriate way. Major-General Jeffery talks of making them a territorial reserve. There is no doubt that we do have difficulties in being able to adequately defend the many facilities we have in this far-flung continent of ours. I suspect that reserves are the way in which we can best do that, rather than utilising the members of the permanent forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that we looked at contingency planning, in order to better utilise the higher level of skill that is now apparent in everybody in the Defence Force. There is no doubt that, with the marked development of technology and the re-equipment, it is necessary to have a higher level of skill. That brings with it a consequently greater loss when the training, the experience and the education of a former member of the ADF goes back into the civilian force. Indeed, we are all conscious of the degree to which, for example, the civilian airlines for years have relied on the training of the RAAF to provide a constant regeneration of personnel for their new air fleets, and even for the maintenance of their existing air fleets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the idea of looking for some way in which we can get better use of those who are retiring from the permanent forces is something that should be addressed. If we did that, and we provided more money so that we could better maintain the morale of people in the services, we would be a lot better off. When we start talking about management-initiated early retirement and limited tenure appointments, the consequences concern me. I think that both measures place a particular responsibility on the chiefs of the respective services: the navy, the army and the air force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Were this measure to be introduced in this form in the Australian Public Service, I think many people in the Public Service would be very sceptical. They would be worried about being given promotions to higher levels for temporary periods of time. It just does not work in civilian employment, or, if it works, it does not work to quite the same degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that there have been a number of temporary appointments in the services, over the years. It has always been a practice of the system. But I am a little concerned about the way in which it is going to be played out. For that reason, I think that the success or otherwise of this measure is going to depend very much on the way in which it is administered. For that reason, the various chiefs of the defence forces will need to be very careful, as I am sure they will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose the measures. But, as I say, I do have some particular reservations about some aspects of the legislation. </PARA>

On that basis, pursuant to section 55B(1), (3) and (4), counsel has a right of audience in any State court in relation to the exercise by that court of federal jurisdiction. Because the Commonwealth was a party to the proceedings instituted by Mr Gilvarry, the Victorian Supreme Court was exercising federal jurisdiction in those proceedings.

I also understand that ATSIC has referred matters noted in the report to the Queensland Police and that inquiries are being conducted by Queensland Police in relation to this matter. The ASC has advised that it will continue to monitor the matter in the light of Police inquiries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised that Australia's application for the extradition of Mr Christopher Skase from Spain was refused by the Criminal Division of the Spanish National Court, on the basis of its concerns about the prospects for the safe return of Mr Skase to Australia by land or by sea. I understand that the Court accepted that Mr Skase suffered from serious progressive disease of the lungs, and concluded that his forced return to Australia may damage Mr Skase's health or endanger his life. In terms of the legal basis for the decision, the Court referred to Article 15 of the Spanish Constitution, which provides that the individual's rights to life, physical integrity and health are pre-eminent, and to Article 3(2)(f) of the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and Spain, which provides that extradition may be refused `where the requested State, while also taking into account the nature of the offence and the interests of the requesting State, considers that, in the exceptional circumstances of the case, the extradition would be incompatible with humanitarian considerations'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The only information received by my Department which may indicate a change in the circumstances relating to Mr Skase's health has been provided by way of media reports from Spain suggesting that Mr Skase appears to be in sound physical condition. Notwithstanding those reports, I do not intend to apply to the Spanish authorities for the re-examination of the case. I am advised that the Spanish Court's decision was expressed to be final, and that it stated that no further appeal was available. Following the release of that decision, my Department sought formal advice on the prospects of reapplying for Mr Skase's extradition from Spain in the event that it could be demonstrated Mr Skase was medically fit to travel to Australia. The advice from both the Spanish Govern-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ment prosecutor responsible for the extradition proceedings and the leading Spanish lawyer engaged by the Australian Government to assist in the case indicated that as a matter of Spanish law there was virtually no chance of succeeding in another extradition request.</PARA>
