</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. The honourable member said it is a technical hiccup. The fact is that the government's management of this country has been a technical hiccup from start to finish. For example, in the last week or so on the woodchips issue we had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying that he was going to come in as a white knight throwing around hand grenades to protect 509 coupes. Honourable members might remember that. What a shambolic performance that was! We found out yesterday that 10 of those coupes in Victoria do not even exist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you go through this government's performance, the reality is that this is a government which is in a state of total chaos and confusion. I speak this morning because I think that ought to be remarked upon. The Australian public ought to be aware of the shambles which this government is in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5), which is the subject of the motion to suspend standing orders, is a pretty significant issue. It is a bill for an act to amend the law relating to taxation. In layman's terms, I suppose in itself it is a symbol of the shambles within the government, because basically this tax law before the parliament is designed to correct technical errors made by the government in the past. Here we have a bill to fix up the government's previous mistakes, but in the handling of this bill the government has made yet another mistake in the forms and procedures of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians properly feel that they pay far too much tax as it is, quite apart from the fact that they face a system which is so complex that hardly a person in the country has a full and comprehensive understanding of Australia's tax laws. The responsible minister, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), should have been in the parliament yesterday to conduct the passage of his legislation through the parliament. The reason that he was not here is for him to explain to the House. Beyond his embarrassment, I think he ought to apologise to the House for his failure to attend to his duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's failure ought to be a signal to other ministers that they have a responsibility to be in the parliament for the carriage of their own legislation. The Assistant Treasurer is not the only minister who has offended this very basic rule; in fact, a load of ministers have done so. For example, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), in the short time that she has been in the parliament, has become notorious for not fronting up for debates on issues for which she is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the whole approach of ministers to government is typified not only by their failure to attend the parliament for the carriage of their legislation but also by their failure to attend question time. We now actually have a system, put in place by the Prime Minister, which legitimises ministers not fronting up to question time. We have a roster so that they can evade their accountability and responsibility to the Australian people. So it is that, rather than this being an isolated example of a minister not abiding by his responsibilities, these people have institutionalised a lack of accountability to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not only the issue, as I mentioned, of questions without notice asked during question time but also the issue of ministers answering questions which are put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. There are questions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> going back months and months which these people have failed to answer. In fact, I think in the Treasury there is a policy that you do not answer questions on notice unless you have done absolutely everything else that has been requested of you. In other words, questions on notice are the lowest of all priorities. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an isolated occurrence. Unfortunately, it is a reflection of an arrogance towards the parliament, a disregard for the parliament, a contempt for the parliament, which starts at the very top of the government with the Prime Minister. He is the man who once said that question time was an indulgence offered by the executive to the opposition. That is one of the most classic statements of contempt for the parliament ever made in the Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a farcical situation at question time. For years, we had a government that refused to answer questions. When there was a bit of political pressure for the government to do something about it, it agreed to seven questions a side. Even now, the Prime Minister is not prepared to abide by the seven questions a side. The number of questions being asked in question time has plummeted from the levels that it was 10, 15 or 20 years ago. In 1970, 1,187 questions were asked and, in 1979, 1,033 questions were asked. Since Labor has been in office, the number of questions asked per annum has at no stage gone above 934, which was the best of Labor's efforts. The fact is that we are getting fewer questions in; we are getting far longer answers&mdash;I have got the statistics which show the average length of answers; and, most crucially, when you do get an answer, it is not an answer to the question that you asked, just a bucket on the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all very entertaining for the gallery; it is great for people who think the parliament ought to be theatre, not a place of accountability. But what it does&mdash;right from the top, from the Prime Minister down&mdash;is send a message that these ministers are not prepared to be accountable. So it is that today we have this classic shambles from a minister who had a responsibility to be in the parliament but simply ignored and dismissed that responsibility, so much so that he is embarrassed by the fact that he has to front up this morning and move a series of procedural motions to get his legislation back on track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough; it is not good enough by half. We intend to take this issue to the government. It ought to treat the parliament not so much with the respect that the opposition deserves as with the respect that the Australian public deserves from the premier democratic institution in this country. We will have all sorts of excuses. One of the favourite excuses is that everyone is tarred with the same brush. That is an excuse directed to the natural cynicism of the Australian public. But the truth is that, when we last had a coalition in government, the parliament was treated with far greater respect than that with which these people have ever treated it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is often talk about changes to the rules and procedures, and those things ought to be sensibly looked at. Nothing more simple than a change in the attitude of the Prime Minister and his senior ministers&mdash;and for that attitude to flow through to the balance of his executive&mdash;is needed to restore the parliament and to provide it with the respect it deserves. Today characterises this point, and the opposition will not allow it to pass. The reality is that these people treat the parliament with contempt. We demand far higher standards of these ministers and all ministers, and we intend to keep them up to the mark. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is useful to recollect the circumstances that have led to this motion. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) has covered some of them. You may recall, Mr Speaker, that the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1994 yesterday proceeded without one single government member backing the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). There was not one speaker from that side. I do not recall exactly but seven or eight from this side followed procedures and contributed to debate on what, after all, was a measure to make 17 changes to various acts involving taxation of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a classic demonstration of how the arrogance and disdain of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) towards this parliament have become contagious amongst his ministry. Ministers are all infected. We see it time and again. The honourable member for Flinders has already spoken about it. Ministers do not even deign to come into this place to see carriage of their own legislation. The simple truth is that these procedures would not have been necessary had the minister been in here at the appropriate time&mdash;at least at the end of the second reading debate. He might have even considered answering the objections and arguments of the opposition, but that might have been too much to expect. Had he been in here, he may not have followed the necessary procedures anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the minister made no mention of amendments to be moved by the government at the detail stage. He made not one single mention of them. Usually, he is well enough informed to know when the government has cocked up the original drafting of legislation&mdash;as it invariably does with tax bills&mdash;and is going to have to move correcting amendments to its own legislation in the detail stage. I repeat: in this case, I do not think that the minister even knew that there were to be amendments in the consideration in detail stage. He certainly did not give this House any indication in his second reading speech that that was to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one single member of the government decided it was necessary to come in here and debate what, after all, is very important and complex legislation. But members of that same party could find a team to come in here during the adjournment debate&mdash;almost immediately after these proceedings had concluded&mdash;to bucket our leader, to do a hatchet job on the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government members can go into the theatre, into the character assassination bit, but they cannot come in here and talk about their own legislation. I find that offensive. As I say, it is an indication of the arrogance and disdain that the Prime Minister shows towards the parliament and that has filtered down through the government's ranks. I am greatly affronted by the need to go through these proceedings. I simply want to record my absolute disgust that this has proven to be necessary. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday I spoke in the grievance debate about how this government would like the House to fall into a state of irrelevance. On a number of occasions I have addressed the issue of ministers' responsibility for bills here. I mentioned last week, as I have mentioned on those previous occasions, how rare it is to receive any sort of response to the second reading debate these days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject is the disdain with which the minister is treating this House when it comes to her bills. There has been much comment in this chamber about this matter and especially about question time, which is about the only occasion when she comes in to answer some dorothy dixer asked by her own backbench. Now I know the minister was here once for a bill. In a sense I do not blame her, because all she is doing is what all her colleagues have shown her to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was about to point out, when I was so helpfully interrupted by my colleagues, that she has not been here for debate on child-care bills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She is also the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women. She is never here for the debates. She is never here to respond to anything that even her own colleagues have said, much less what the opposition has said. Over time we have become rather used to ministers, if they are here&mdash;or parliamentary secretaries, if ministers are not here&mdash;giving some sort of response only to points raised by their own colleagues. However, because no government members bothered to speak to this bill, there was not any response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development who copped the opprobrium of this particular error. She obviously was not briefed about what was necessary&mdash;even if the government knew. Reference has been made to the fact that this reflects the attitude of the Prime Minister, the member for Blaxland (Mr Keating).

I want to place on the record that, for all the years he was Treasurer, the member for Blaxland did not acknowledge, much less reply to, a single letter I wrote to him on behalf of my constituents. I did not even get a printed card. On occasions, I have been insulted by other ministers who have sent me a printed card saying, `We got your letter.' I got nothing from the member for Blaxland and I also never received any response from prompting and follow-up letters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly two years ago in this House, I asked the Prime Minister a question without notice on a matter that touched on national security: namely, admission to Australia of leading figures of international organised crime. Some months later, I got a letter from the Prime Minister on the subject, which I appreciated. He sent me a thoughtful letter that he signed. And, Mr Speaker, I have framed it. I shall say no more on that subject. It is the only letter that I have ever received with his name on it. But it was an issue of national security, and so he should have written to me and given me the result of the government's investigation of that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On occasions I have pointed out that I am aware of one minister who does introduce his own bills and who, almost invariably, is here to reply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to speak to the motion to suspend standing and sessional orders. In his own way, I believe the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has introduced a motion of censure against himself for the manner in which the proceedings of this House have been held in utter contempt. I say that in all sincerity. This is not the first occasion on which the opposition has been subject to the contempt that is now being shown. Contempt is being shown not only for the parliament but for the officers who came here yesterday and sat in on all the debate, reasoning it out and taking notes, none of which were referred to in the final summation, because the minister was not here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about the fact that the contempt started when there were no government speakers. Government members were brought into this place only as a result of a call for a quorum by the member at the table at the time, the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne). They came in and left almost immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should take note of this debate this morning and try to improve the parliamentary system we have at the moment. At the moment, the cost of this parliament is being borne by the many suffering taxpayers. To have that added to because the minister himself failed to do his duty is an irony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are examples that the government can follow. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is invariably here to introduce bills, to listen to the debate on them and to do the summarisation. He picks up the points that have been made during that debate. This is what it is all about. We do not debate things just for the sake of taking up air time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, in his response, should address the three points I raised in my comments yesterday. Firstly, why in this rush for further taxation are trade unions still exempt from tax on the income from their investments? Secondly&mdash;and there is a real complaint in the community about this&mdash;why are business vehicles and vessels that have a capacity of under 12 passengers still subject to sales tax? The third point&mdash;and this should be before the government&mdash;relates to the deductibility of legal expenses in litigation. Obviously, the law favours the financial institutions, which can claim litigation expenses as tax deductions, whereas private litigants cannot. Obviously, the courts are being jammed up because these institutions are going to litigation instead of using some form of negotiation. They were points I made. I hope the minister has been briefed so that he can give a response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a marvellous opportunity for us within this place to complain generally that the system is not working. The parliament is being held in contempt by government ministers, and by no less a person than the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself, who in the course of three days last week showed up in this place for a period of two or three hours. I think that is absolutely contemptible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of people suffering at the moment, none more so than the taxpayers of Australia. They deserve a better response than has been given to this stage. The opposition appreciates that this is the opportunity to complain, but we do not want to make any political capital by calling for a division. The amendments have to go through. They were available yesterday. I complained that legislation in place has to be amended in 12 or 13 different stages before it is passed in this place. That is a reflection on the minister, the draftsmen and the government itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are just a couple of short points I want to make. It is timely to place on the record that members of the government, members of the Executive Council, are paid in the vicinity of $50,000 each year in addition to their parliamentary salary for the additional responsibilities that they take on, which include the need for them to present in the parliament legislation for which they are responsible, to undertake the care and carriage of that legislation, to bring it through the parliamentary processes with care and consideration, and to be in this place to answer the questions which members who are elected to this place are duly entitled to ask.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor Party backbenchers are no more members of government than I am. They are merely there to hold up the numbers, to ensure that those who enjoy the $50,000 a year extra can continue to have the numbers so that they can form the executive government. This is a very timely reminder that ministers are required not only to turn up but, when given their bureaucratic speech to read, to have a knowledge and an understanding of what they are saying. It is not good enough to merely read out the words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means they must have the knowledge that the initial legislation as it was presented had, dare I use the phrase, unintended consequences and that the government itself has discovered it has to be fixed up. In process, it is an exercise of the principle under which this government operates: near enough is good enough. Well, it is not. It is time we saw legislation presented here that has been thoroughly vetted, tested and consulted on before being presented. There seems to be an assumption in the first place that when the government introduces legislation it is the duty of either the opposition and/or the Senate to fix up the mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is going to tell us where he was and why he was not here yesterday. He obviously had something far more important to do. We are all waiting with bated breath to know what it was. We will be interested to hear him tell us what was far more important than being here in the chamber to undertake the duty for which he is paid additional money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) thought that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had not yet appeared in the chamber when a bill relating to her portfolio was being considered. She appeared for the first time during the consideration of bills that are currently before the parliament. It was only the fourth time she had made a speech in this parliament. If we divide that $50,000 a year by four, we see that that is quite a sum of money to be paid for one speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who very often has carriage of these matters, does a workmanlike, good and disciplined job. It is a pity the minister cannot learn from her parliamentary secretary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After leave was denied, I asked my office to find out why the opposition had not been furnished with these amendments. As I said, they had been circulated on 31 January. I found out that my previous parliamentary liaison officer from the tax office always used to send personally a copy of amendments to the shadow Treasurer's office. My new parliamentary liaison officer was unaware of this and obviously did not send the amendments personally to the office of the shadow Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if the shadow Treasurer did not have the amendments. As I said, they were circulated on 31 January. All I can say is that the opposition was a bit confused about whether it had the amendments or not. Leave was not granted to the government because the opposition claimed that it did not have the amendments. The opposition had the amendments all the time. It seems to me that we have to spoon-feed those opposite and give them the amendments personally. We cannot rely on the normal internal processes of this place to get the amendments to the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time we have amendments I will ask the parliamentary liaison officer in my office to personally take them to the shadow Treasurer's office because he is too lazy to circulate the official list that comes around through the normal procedures. That is the reason why the government was denied leave yesterday: those opposite thought that they did not have the amendments. They had them all the time. We will continue spoon-feeding the opposition. It is such a hopeless opposition that we have to personally deliver these amendments, otherwise the opposition believes that it does not have them. We will continue to do that because we do not believe that those opposite are capable of doing it themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will respond to a few of the points that were made. A lot of the points were trivial, but we understand all that. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) asked three different questions. I understand that they are not part of the package, but I will undertake to get the answers for the honourable member. I refer particularly to the question relating to deductibility. I served with  the  honourable member for Dawson, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), and you, Mr Speaker, on the finance and public administration committee. I recognise that that is one of the points that was constantly brought up during the committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have asked me where I was and I think I owe them an answer. We have a system in this place that guarantees that ministers will be here in plenty of time to respond.

If we ever want to know that, we will not be asking those opposite.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, before the debate was adjourned, I was outlining briefly that this legislation to amend the health insurance rules of Australia will not achieve the reforms needed in Medicare and will not relieve the public hospital system and the public health system of the enormous pressures that have developed over 12 years of Labor's mismanagement of the health system. I believe the legislation was designed primarily by the rather desperate and very absent Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)&mdash;she is not even here now to supervise this major legislation&mdash;and by her government to create a smokescreen before the federal election and to divert the community's attention away from the fundamental problems that face the health system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems have been largely caused by the federal government's lack of leadership, its lack of input and its confusion. Instead of ensuring that Medicare remains strong and healthy, the federal Labor government is constantly weakening it by its failure to make the appropriate leadership decisions and adjustments which would ensure that Medicare remains strong and healthy&mdash;which it is not now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be quite clear to any fair person who steps back from the health debate that the Medicare system at the moment, from the federal government's perspective, has not maintained adequate resources and funding to enable the partners&mdash;the states throughout Australia, whether administered by Labor or Liberal premiers&mdash;to deliver the type of service which was promised originally by Prime Minister Hawke, a promise broken by Prime Minister Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, this legislation has failed to take the opportunity to address one of the fundamental problems with the private health sector in Australia. The federal government must ensure that the health system in Australia is strong and healthy and that both arms of it, the public and private sectors, are given the necessary leadership and support. Without the two of them working in partnership and complementing each other in the roles they have, Australia's health system cannot continue to be a strong and good one, and an example to the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve years ago it was acknowledged by everyone in Australia that the Victorian health system was amongst the best in the world, if not the best. Victoria, like all other states, including Queensland under a Labor Premier, is now unable to say that its health system is the best in the world, and it is under enormous pressure. Part of the reason is that the federal Labor government has failed over 12 years to ensure that the private arm of health delivery is strong and vibrant, and developing and functioning in the way that it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you a brief example of what has happened under Labor's mismanagement of the private sector in Australia. Since the introduction of Medicare 12 years ago, there have been almost 3 1/2 million Australians drop out of private health insurance. In fact, the current minister unabashedly admitted, in a matter of public importance debate in this place in October-November last year, that it was the original intention of her side of Labor&mdash;which we all know is the left side of Labor&mdash;to drive people out of private insurance and to have them rely on the safety net of Medicare. She is quite proud of that claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was quite unabashed by the fact that the rate of drop-out is increasing, not diminishing. I think I saw her quietly smiling to herself, because that is the philosophical direction that her side of the Labor Party wants to see, that is, a total socialisation of the health system. It is rather remarkable that the minister for health is not even here to handle her own legislation today, this legislation that she claims&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the parliamentary secretary is here, and I welcome him, not that he has not got a strong commitment to the health debate. I know he has. I have enjoyed hearing him, and will enjoy hearing him again today. He would be embarrassed that his minister has not seen fit to come into this parliament for this debate on her own legislation, which she claims will strengthen the private health sector of Australia, belatedly. But it is not going to do that. There are a number of major problems with this legislation that will not enable the health system to reach the strength of both private and public sector partnership that we all know it must have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a dismal record we find. The government is now attempting to bring in some patchy legislation; attempting to prop up the private health sector, claiming it will stem the flow of people dropping out of private health cover, thus reducing the pressure on the public health system, but not being able to sustain that argument; and, at the same time, presiding over an increase in the number of people leaving the private health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, 3 1/2 million people have left the private health system since Labor started on this path of undermining its own Medicare system 12 years ago, the reason being, philosophically, that it is divided and cannot agree that the public and the private sectors have to be strong together. That is the fundamental core problem for Australians today. We have a government that cannot, as in so many other cases, agree on how to run a system properly, because it is divided in itself as to how it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the parliamentary secretary would admit privately that many of his colleagues hate to see $1 of taxpayers' money being used to support the private health system of Australia in its many facets. Yesterday we heard speeches from members of the government indicating that. If we read them carefully, we will see that the underlying thread throughout the debate was that the federal Labor government, over the last 12 years, has been unable to accept that a strong healthy system of health in Australia can be achieved only if we have a strong public and private health system working together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of Labor's mismanagement of this policy, and its division, paralysis and inability to resolve it, is that the public health system has had to cop more expenses than it should. In other words, more people have dropped out of private health because, in a recession, they cannot afford it. We all know that trying to keep a family in the environment that the Labor Party has created in Australia is a very daunting task. The recession has caused much hardship and pain to many people and families have had to cut back. But, incidentally, this government has not cut back. It increased its expenditure last year by 20 per cent when families, small business and others in Australia, including state and local governments, had to cut back. That is rather an interesting issue that we can talk about in more depth at another time. I look forward to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of Labor's mismanagement of the private and public health partnership in Australia, we now find that the cost of public health is greater in respect of public hospitals than it was before. That is because more people are now requiring public health support rather than subsidised support through their own contributions from the private health system. The research papers of the Private Hospitals Association of Australia claim that for every one per cent of Australians who drop out of private health it costs another $100 million of taxpayers' money to support the public hospitals that have to take on the extra workload. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time the minister appeared in this parliament in a major debate on health was during a matter of public importance debate. I find it remarkable that she is not here today during the debate on her own legislation. Just think about that. In the MPI last year, she conceded that there was an enormous extra cost on public health by reason of people dropping out of private health insurance in Australia. She said that the coalition and the Private Hospitals Association were wrong in saying that for every one per cent of Australians who drop out of private health it cost $100 million. She said that was not right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sat there thinking, `Here it comes. She is now going to tell us what she says is the position and that it is not costing the public health system any more money for all these people who have been forced to drop out of private health.' That is what I thought she was going to say. But she said, `It is not $100 million; it's only $65 million for every one per cent.' It is amazing how these people&mdash;particularly these ex-Western Australia Inc. people&mdash;throw figures around like that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I have read the parliamentary secretary's body language correctly, he thinks that is not right. Go and read what the minister said in the MPI last year. She said that it cost $65 million more in the public health system for every one per cent of Australians who drop out of private health. We say that it is $100 million and she says that it is $65 million. If we take the minister's figure of $65 million, what does that mean for the public health system and public hospitals in Australia? How much extra cost will be thrown on them because of that transfer? The cost will be several hundred million dollars. The public hospital system will have to cope with at least an extra $500 million or $600 million per year because Labor has pulled the lever the wrong way and forced people out of private health insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are getting submissions from many people with a great interest in the health system pointing out major defects in this legislation. That is why the coalition spokesperson on this bill has very wisely foreshadowed that the coalition will seek support in the Senate for a proper inquiry into the effects of this legislation so that people in Australia with varying interests in the health system will be able to give advice on how they believe the bill will impinge on them or benefit them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These bills are about consumers, about their protection and about providing them with more information about their medical treatment. They are also about competition, about micro-economic reform and about ensuring that private health insurance in this country is relevant to the economic climate of the mid-1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the private health insurance system is not presently relevant to the health needs of many&mdash;indeed most&mdash;Australians because it does not provide them any longer with what they regard as good value for money. Decades ago, prior to the fundamental and historic reforms of the Whitlam government which guaranteed affordable access to health care to all Australians, including those who were unable to afford private insurance at that time, those private insurance schemes operating under a highly regulated system which has persisted to this day&mdash;and, indeed, if the opposition and the Democrats in the Senate have their way, probably for 12 months longer&mdash;did provide a reasonable mechanism for reimbursing those who required medical attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the private health insurance system that operated prior to Medibank did not reach all Australians because, as I said, many of them simply could not afford it, and this was a fatal flaw in that health insurance structure. No-one concerned about equity and social justice could allow such a system to continue, and Medibank, as it then was, has proved a most successful and enduring reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conservative governments since that time and conservative oppositions latterly have sought to modify or abandon Medicare, but they have consistently failed in those attempts before the Australian people at the election. They have also consistently failed to enunciate any kind of credible long-term health policy for this nation. Following the last election, the opposition correctly identified its failure to identify clear policy as one of the factors contributing to its defeat at the polls, and I certainly agree with that analysis. The opposition has not made much progress since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the opposition, the government has been working to identify areas where the current arrangements could be improved. The Medicare fundamentals are well set and we can now turn our attention to the other side of that equation&mdash;the private health sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constricting regulation which has clothed and, indeed, almost smothered the private health insurance industry to date needs attention. It is relevant to approach that task now as the community is correctly perceiving the benefits of micro-economic reform and competition policies in all sectors of the community and the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms proposed by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in this bill will go a long way towards setting the private health insurance industry on a path of open competition and consumer focus. They allow the funds to reach agreements with the providers of services&mdash;be they doctors or hospitals&mdash;on a competitive basis, and they allow the funds to offer a range of products to their clients which can more accurately reflect the needs of that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms will also put the industry on notice that cost is an important issue and that it must find ways to hold our health costs at acceptable levels as a proportion of our GDP. Although one must acknowledge that the growing demands of an increasingly technological and interventionist medical regime, as well as the growing health aspirations and expectations of the community, will mean some growth in the medium term in the share of our GDP that we allocate to health. It is certainly worth spending a moment to examine this concept further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure on health care is a very large sum indeed in this country and all other Western countries. Our expenditure is in the order of $35 billion nationally. Despite this massive sum, Australia's health care costs as a proportion of our GDP are not that high by OECD standards. International comparisons show that we are in the middle of the range of OECD countries and that, over the last decade or so, we have been able to stabilise our expenditure in this area. This is to be contrasted with countries like the United States, which has seen a massive blow-out in the contribution of health care to its national expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from international studies that we need a powerful countervailing market force which acts against, in market terms, those who provide the services to consumers. Unlike most other industries, health care has the significant advantage that it catches its clients when they are least able to bargain or negotiate and deals in a commodity which we all hold most dear&mdash;the health of ourselves and our loved ones. I do not for a moment suggest that the medical profession has historically exploited this emotional leverage to secure higher fees. Indeed, I believe that most GPs and health care providers act with considerable compassion and altruism towards their patients. But the fact remains that over the years there has been little market pressure brought to bear on this industry by comparison with most others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same situation prevails in the provision of information to patients and the way in which the very nature of medicine and the manner in which it is practised in Western society places great faith and trust in the professional judgment of the doctor. It has in the past&mdash;and in some quarters still is&mdash;been considered quite inappropriate for a patient or their family to question a doctor about the treatment which is offered or the reasonable alternatives to that treatment. Fortunately, that view is rapidly changing; I congratulate the majority of the medical profession for  encouraging their patients to ask questions about treatment, risks and options. Issues such as the ownership of medical records will also need to be dealt with in the future, but I am sure you will remind me that that argument is for another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the fact remains that there is considerable uncertainty about the efficacy of some medical interventions&mdash;often the most expensive, complex and technologically based&mdash;and the information upon which the decisions about the use of such treatments is based is held almost exclusively by providers of that service. In strict economic terms and in the context of medical ethics this is certainly an issue which the community and the profession needs to continuously address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation goes to the first part of that issue and will certainly encourage public debate about the latter, as funds and providers negotiate towards contracts and the public starts to have a choice about the kind of private health insurance package it feels best meets its needs. It will also ensure that there is better information in the public arena about the various kinds of private insurance available under the reformed system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must never forget that private health insurance is supplementary to the universal coverage provided by Medicare. The public insurance system represents the foundation of our medical service. It provides insurance coverage on an equitable basis for both public and private health services. After all, treatment by a general practitioner represents the best in what private medical treatment is all about in terms of primary health care, and that is covered by Medicare, as is a major part of the cost of private medical services in a private hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us also remember that the level of usage of private hospitals has actually risen over the last 10 years. Between 1982-83 and 1992-93, admissions to private hospitals rose from 23 per cent to 29.6 per cent of all admissions. Even allowing for the rise in day surgery, that represents significant and strong growth. While private health insurance has certainly declined, the membership of the supplementary tables&mdash;on which private hospitals so much depend&mdash;has been much more stable and, as the statistics indicate, there is no threat to the private hospital industry as such. Indeed, its usage is in good health, as are the reserves of the private health funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also moves us down the casemix path. I strongly support that change, given that it will take place in the context of sound planning and management. This is to be contrasted with the precipitate rush to casemix funding as some sort of health holy grail, which was demonstrated in particular by the Victorian and South Australian Liberal governments. When applied in a considered way, with time for adjustment, casemix should be a valuable tool to reward efficiency and effectiveness. But, when applied without time for the affected institutions to plan and manage change properly&mdash;and when implemented in the context of massive budget cuts in health, as was the case in the two states I mentioned&mdash;the effect must certainly be as adverse as it has been in those states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also ensures that patients will not be confronted with a continuing series of accounts when they return home after private hospitalisation. Many patients now find that, when they return home following a period in a private hospital, they are the recipients of an endless  series of&mdash;often  substantial&mdash;accounts. I think the public has rightly seen that as a significant failing in the private health insurance industry and one which these bills seek to address. They will permit the health industry to enter into reasonable contracts on a voluntary basis. This will ensure that the providers of health services&mdash;and also the hospital&mdash;are able to present a single account to the patient. That will certainly instil greater confidence in that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also moves us down the path of accountability for the medical profession in terms of the financial services they offer. It ensures that patients will be in a better position to provide what we might call financial consent to the kinds of operations they are about to undergo, understanding not only principally and primarily the kind of medical treatment and the risks and options associated with that but also as a secondary matter the cost of that treatment and what they can expect of their medical practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said in this debate about the potential socialisation of medicine by the government and the alleged wish to ensure that there is only a public system of health in this country. That is simply not the case. It is not this government that has brought about the decline we have seen in the private health insurance numbers in recent years; the decline in public confidence in that system has been because of the increasing premium costs and the failure of that system to adapt to changes in the 90s. That is the reality of this debate and it is one which this bill at least seeks to address in a rational way. It will allow the private health industry to adapt to changing times and meet the changing needs of its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that people have voted with their feet for the public health insurance system as contrasted with public health medicine. I think it is very important to draw that distinction because many of the public health insurance provisions provide for treatment in a private health context. The service of general practitioners in their surgeries is very much private medicine but the cost is reimbursed from the public health insurance system. I think it is very important to draw the distinction between a private insurance system and a private and public health service. That distinction is very important to members of the public in terms of their ability to get the medical services they need and their freedom to go to a general practitioner of their choice and in whom they have confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without that large public health insurance system, people would not have equitable, full and fair access to medical treatment. That was the failure of the previous system. That was the failure corrected by the Medibank-Medicare system over the last 20 or so years. That is the important system which the public quite rightly demands that we protect and guarantee for its future. But, quite reasonably, there is scope in this country for a private health insurance system. The government does not oppose that system. With these measures, it seeks to make it more relevant and help it survive the next decade. If the system does not change, it will not ultimately survive. That is an important issue that needs to be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there is no attempt by this government to extinguish those private health funds in any way whatsoever. That is not a policy objective or policy plank. Many members from this side of the House, as do many from the other side, support the private health insurance industry in principle. However, it has to be relevant, it has to meet the people's needs and do so at a reasonable cost. We must always bear in mind that the private health insurance system is supplementary and secondary to the primary public health insurance system. The public insurance system in this country covers every citizen as of right. It is not the case that they would want the opposition to put it aside. They will demand that this government enhances and preserves the system into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the debate on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994. I remind honourable members of the very effective jingle for Medibank Private which goes: `I feel better, so much better; I feel better now.' The question I ask members when analysing this bill is: will we feel much better? I think not. Contrary to the views of those opposite who wish to politicise such an important social issue, I do not think we will be better off with the introduction of this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have certain rights. It could be argued that the right to good health is one to which we should all aspire. Certainly my colleagues opposite believe that we should have a socialised health system to provide health for all, no matter the standards and no matter the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), a person who is sincere about social issues and chair of his caucus health committee, says the issues are very clear. He said it was important to be aware of the issues, and he criticised the opposition for not fully knowing or understanding the issues. Yet he spoke for 20 minutes without even mentioning any issues. I sincerely hope he will not be so reserved in detail or in verbosity in voicing his concerns about the reduction of Aboriginal health funding likely to be announced shortly by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in transferring funding from the ATSIC portfolio into the health portfolio, which will obviously have a detrimental impact on Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As legislators, with the introduction of each new piece of legislation, we should ask ourselves why we need it. Why then do we need this legislation? The minister, on one of her rare appearances in this chamber, was able to explain the government's reasons for the bill's introduction, and they were: value for money in the private health service; a wider choice of product; and reforms for efficiency and access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assumption is that the current system is not working and, therefore, we need to change. According to the minister, this bill will provide that change, yet in my analysis of the bill and evaluating the minister's speech I can see no benefit or specific activity which will meet these ideals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says that consumers are not happy with the current system. That is correct&mdash;they are very unhappy and they are leaving the private health insurance system in droves. Some 20 per cent of private health insurance fund users have left the system over the past 10 years&mdash;and the member for Moreton says that this mass evacuation would not impact upon the public health system. Of course it would not immediately if they are healthy; but, if they ever become unhealthy, it would as they would not be members of the private health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the minister admits to an impact of $65 million for every one per cent of health fund users leaving the system being added to public funding. Considering the expense of health in Australia, the picture of how important private insurers are becomes quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total health bill in Australia each year is around $34 billion. That rolls off the tongue pretty well&mdash;$34 billion. When we say it quickly, we do not really realise how big this might be in real terms. But this equates to $64,000 per minute, or a staggering $3.8 million an hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the entire year&mdash;$3.8 million and still we have problems in funding this particular very important health and social issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would think that, with that sort of expenditure, we would get it right. But, `No,' says the minister, `this is why we need the legislation.' The private health insurance sector provides $11 billion&mdash;some 33 per cent of the total expenditure for Australian health. They only provide that whilst people are actually in the system providing those sorts of funds. Yet consumers are leaving rapidly and, for every one per cent, an extra $65 million&mdash;although industry people say it is $100 million, but the minister admits to $65 million&mdash;of taxpayers' funds is needed to cover the loss. So taxpayers are paying for the loss of private insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does this bill address this issue? In my view, no, it does not, and I will explain why. The argument as to whether we need a private health insurance system is provided by the caucus-ACTU paper on health&mdash;and I want to thank the person concerned for borrowing it for me&mdash;where they support the notion of Professor Jeff Richardson who argues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implication of the discussion paper is that the political decision has been made to stabilise the existing division between the public and private hospital sectors. This is a political decision but it is important to note that there is no economic or other imperative for the adoption of this particular solution.</PARA>
<PARA>This view is supported by the Australian Hospital Association. The working group, however, supported more fully the proposition of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, which submitted:</PARA>
<PARA>We are concerned the discussion paper appears to support the narrow view government outlays on health must be contained and taxpayers must be protected from higher cost such as taxes or levies. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This seems to ignore the fact that the community and taxpayers are in broad terms the same.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Policy changes that merely shift costs from taxpayers to the community are doing nobody any favours at all and will be viewed with suspicion by the community.</PARA>
<PARA>So what the member for Moreton, the chair of this committee, supports is an increase in health funding to cover the losses through the private sector. By implication, this means an increase in taxes or a reduction in other government expenditures&mdash;in other words, the government transferring the cost from one department to another department. It is very much like what it is doing to ATSIC at the moment. It is going to transfer $50 million of health funding out of the ATSIC budget back into the health budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat confusing to determine the government position on this issue, because government members have contrary views. The Minister for Human Services and Health says that this bill will help those who want private cover to stay in the system, but where in the bill does it say that it is going to help people stay in the system and is going to encourage people to join the system? The minister says that the bill will make private cover more competitive, and the legislation then goes about ensuring that there will be an increase in administration costs. Therefore, the funds will have to either reduce services or increase premiums to pay for those extra costs. Surely anyone with some basic knowledge of business principles realises that if you increase expenditure prices will increase. If they do not, then services will be reduced. Therefore, in my view, increases to premiums are imminent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Minister for Human Services and Health of the caucus discussion paper, which she appears not to have read&mdash;along with a lot of other things. On page 21, table 2 shows the reasons for cover lapsing. It shows that 61 per cent of people find that the premium is too expensive and they cannot afford it. Yet this bill, through what the minister says are reduced premiums, is supposed to encourage people to join health funds. How can the government reduce premiums when it is increasing costs? It is beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason stated for people leaving private cover is an overwhelming response that premiums are too expensive and the customers cannot afford them. The minister acts contrary to her own caucus and, through the introduction of this particular bill, is prepared to increase the cost of joining a health fund</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just recap for a moment. The minister is introducing this bill to reduce the flow of people from private funds. She says the legislation will allow the private funds to be more competitive, provide wider choice and be more efficient. She also admits to a $65 million additional impact on taxpayers for every one per cent leaving the funds. The industry says $100 million, but she admits to $65 million. The minister also concedes the importance of private funds to the national health system. Her caucus committee supports the opposite position: the notion that taxes should be increased to offset the loss of private funding to cover the $65 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Caucus also recommends that doctors, hospitals and health funds not contract with one another. I think that was recommendation 14. Yet this bill encourages doctors, health funds and hospitals to contract with one another. The minister thinks that this contractual process is the cornerstone of the legislation, but it is contrary to the caucus view in recommendation 14. What is going on? Has the minister not listened to her own caucus committee, which according to the committee chairman went all over Australia listening to points of view? She obviously has not read the recommendations or listened to her caucus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister believes this bill will improve competition and, by implication, reduce costs. With the administration costs likely to increase, the only way that competition will be effective and costs reduced is through amalgamation. By implication the minister supports the notion that amalgamations are very good. Yet, again, her caucus has recommended that funds not amalgamate. She has gone contrary to what caucus has recommended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the minister has no control over her portfolio. We must remember that the Labor Party has not handled this issue at all well over the last few years. In fact, four ministers have administered this portfolio over the last four years. This minister joined this parliament very recently and was shoehorned into her ministerial position, overriding a lot of talented people already in the party. She jumped in, with not much experience, over people with a lot of experience and a lot of talent in her own party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She really does not understand her portfolio. She abuses the President of the AMA, who has been a member of the Labor Party for 20 years. She does not answer letters to her office, and we have evidence of her not answering questions on notice. This minister is out of control and does not understand her portfolio. This bill is further evidence of her lack of ministerial ability, which is much less than that of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), who is at the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To confirm further how this minister has got it wrong, let us reflect on the former Labor health minister's comments about health and the requirement for a healthy private health fund sector. Former Senator Richardson is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think my . . . role is to administer Medicare, and that means public access in public hospitals. That has to be the thrust of all that I do, but you can't do it properly unless there's a vibrant private sector and I think that's what has been missed over the course of the last few years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That could be a comment relating to the last few months. One reason why those waiting lists are long and why it is so difficult is that we have let private health insurance numbers get too low&mdash;it is about 37 per cent at the moment. I think former Senator Richardson recommended 40 per cent. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the drift into the public system, which we've heralded as such a great system, has I think gotten to the stage now where we can't take it any more.</PARA>
<PARA>The former minister said, `We can't take it anymore.' Yet the caucus committee chair, the member for Moreton, has said that we can take more. It is all part of his paper. They do not seem to be working together in the same direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current minister says, `Yes, it is a problem but we don't need to panic. Let us try some legislation and hopefully we'll attract numbers back into the funds.' We can take that a bit cynically, I think. In his report the member for Moreton states that the reason for people opting out is the cost of premiums&mdash;by far the biggest reason for leaving. Yet this legislation will increase premiums. Does this bill try to address this particular issue? No, it does not. According to the experts, premiums will increase. Richo, as he is now known, wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 13 September 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Convincing the Labor Party that the rapid decline in the number of Australians who take out private health insurance is any sort of problem is a very difficult task.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final unveiling of Carmen Lawrence's new reforms for private health insurance provided a predictable outcome . . . they also stop short of addressing the problem.</PARA>

<PARA>That is totally at odds with the remarks of Labor speakers in this debate. I ask my socialist colleagues from the Australian Labor Party to recall the words of Dr Blewett, the then Minister for Health who is the father of the current Medicare system, when he introduced the program to the House. Yesterday the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) quoted the words of Dr Blewett in his last speech where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any decent health economist will tell you that the levels of private insurance are a third or fourth order subject. The central issue for the health system is the working of the public hospital system.</PARA>
<PARA>In his speech when introducing Medicare in the House in 1983&mdash;and I quote from the very good speech of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou) yesterday&mdash;Dr Blewett said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare's continued success and high popularity is dependent upon the maintenance of a strong, viable private health care sector.</PARA>
<PARA>That is contrary to what Dr Blewett felt 10 years later. I am at a loss to understand where the Labor Party stands on this very important social issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have quoted contrary to one another. It seems as though no-one knows exactly what is going on. Let us look at some of the facts. The Australian Labor Party government raises less than 10 per cent of the total health bill through the Medicare levy that every taxpayer pays&mdash;$2.4 billion as compared with $34 billion. Add the tax levy to the $12.8 billion from general revenue and we have over one-quarter of the total income tax take going to health. The numbers of private health insurance users have reduced by half since Labor took office in 1983&mdash;from 68 per cent to 37 per cent. Last year, 335,000 Australians had left the system. We must remember that there is an increase in taxpayers' funds of $65 million for every reduction of one per cent in the number of members of health funds; industry puts the figure at $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are being forced to leave health care because they pay three times: they pay the Medicare levy and other taxes; they pay their subscriptions to the funds; and they pay the gap when they use health services. The recurrent funding for hospitals has reduced almost six per cent over the period from 1983 to 1991. There are a lot of problems within the health system. There is general consensus on both sides of parliament that we need to fix it. How we do it is obviously ideologically driven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government waxes lyrical about its achievements in health, yet why do most people believe that we have a problem? The government fails to provide solutions to the core issues. The minister has admitted that there is a problem, and that is why she is introducing this legislation. Why does the minister ignore the advice of her own caucus report? Why does she ignore the advice of the former minister? She has got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers need only ask themselves whether they would be happy to have their cars serviced by the person recommended by the insurer. In other words, consumers cannot have a choice if the insurer says, `Get that person to service your car.' Why do we accept that notion with our own bodies and our own health? As a result of this legislation the private health funds will be able to say, `You can't go there, but you can go over there.' This is exactly what the minister would have us do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no true reform in this bill. We heard the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) criticise the American system.

It is not a safety net, it is a universal health system for all. In the Fightback proposal, where people on higher incomes would be forced into taking out private health insurance, the idea was that Medicare would be left to look after the lowly paid and those on social security benefits, thus developing a two-tier system. </PARA>

The previous speaker accuses this side of the House of trying to develop an American system, yet it is precisely what the Fightback system would have done.

As we know, prior to Medibank-Medicare, there were many people who did not take out private insurance. They thought they would be okay or did not realise they had to be covered and found themselves in an awful mess when they had huge bills to pay. So I am glad the opposition has embraced Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is talk about wanting to force people on high incomes into private health insurance, but the reality is that most people on high incomes already have private health insurance or simply pay for private care when they need it. I know a lot of people who do that. They say, `Why should I pay huge amounts every month to private health insurance when that amount could be put in the bank and could pay for the private hospital or the private doctor when I need it?' So that idea is a bit of a fallacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having private health insurance is a choice in our universal system. Why do people take out private health insurance? They take it out because they would like a private room, a private hospital in a particular area or their so-called doctor of choice. The previous speaker also talked about being able to choose our own plumbers but we cannot choose our own doctors, but the idea of having the doctor of choice is a bit of a fallacy. We choose our own GP, but who do we go to when we want an operation? We generally go to the surgeon that the GP recommends. When we get to talking about financial quotes for doctors, we will have even more choice in the system. A patient will be able to go back to the local doctor and say, `This bloke is going to charge too much,' and will ask to be referred to someone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People also join health insurance because of waiting lists. Waiting lists are a genuine problem but they are not a problem of Medicare; they are a problem of the public health system operated by the states. People who are likely to want elective surgery&mdash;and hip replacements are a big issue, particularly amongst older people&mdash;are afraid that they will have to wait a long time; and they will. That is the reason a lot of pensioners remain on private health insurance. There are some doctors who operate only in the private system. This applies to a lot of orthopaedic surgeons, which is one of the reasons for the long waiting lists for hip replacements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker also referred to one of the reasons people drop out of private health insurance&mdash;the high cost of premiums. In a recession, obviously people who are unemployed are not going to be able to keep up their premiums. Several of the health economists showed the working group graphs which indicated that in times of high unemployment people drop out and they come back when they resume work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason people drop out is the huge gap payments they have to make. This legislation goes a long way towards addressing that, a point I am sorry the opposition has not seen fit to see. The young and healthy also drop out. One of the people giving evidence to the working group made the comment that if waiting lists could be fixed up a lot more people would drop out of private health insurance. Contrasting public and private health costs is interesting. I would like to quote from evidence given to the working group by Christine, aged in her 30s. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both my girlfriend and I had identical surgery procedure but because she was under the Medicare scheme, her husband had one form to sign and there was no cost whatsoever for her stay in hospital. After paying close to 50 dollars per month for top hospital cover with my private fund, it took my husband nearly 45 minutes to fill out the barrage of forms. It cost me, after I had to run around and settle each individual account and everything was reimbursed an additional 127 dollars for the privilege of still sharing the same room, not having my choice of doctor as my surgery was an emergency and I had the same hospital staff and care as my girlfriend had.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the gap that Christine had to pay is sometimes much greater. I am sure that most members here have had a lot of people coming into their electoral offices in great distress when they have bills worth thousands of dollars to pay after their health insurance is settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there a crisis? The last member quoted&mdash;and I must say a couple of times misquoted&mdash;the former Senator Richardson on whether or not there was a crisis. All the evidence we have seen shows that there is not a crisis but that the occupation of private hospitals is high and is growing. There are no empty beds there any more than there are in the public sector. They are being fully utilised, either by people with private health insurance or people who are willing to pay themselves. It is in the interests of the states, which operate the public hospital system, to say that there is a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health minister in New South Wales, Ron Phillips, in the lead-up to a state election is pushing this bandwagon very strongly. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday he was complaining. The federal government gave New South Wales an extra $180 million last year because it complained that it was not getting enough, that things were tough. Yet what has happened in New South Wales? We have bed and hospital closures and a lot of cutbacks in the hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had very close personal experience of that in the last couple of weeks because my senior electoral officer is in hospital at the moment. She was taken in the Sunday before last for investigation for a problem. She has had a vast number of tests. After about eight or nine days it was found what was wrong with her. I maintain that if there were more staff at the hospital this would have been found a lot quicker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The X-ray and pathology services at this hospital close over the weekend, so the blood tests she had on Friday did not come back until Monday. It has cost her another two days to be in hospital during that time. She is unable to eat or drink and she has been on a drip. The drip was blocked for four hours the other day and the nurse said, `I am sorry, there are higher priorities.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the nurse's fault. The nurse is highly qualified and she is doing her job. There simply are not enough nurses. The New South Wales hospital system will be on trial on 25 March. I think the people of New South Wales will agree that it has been found wanting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come to the substance of the bill. One of the first things the bill will do is make health insurance a bit more consumer friendly. One of the ways it will do that is by providing better information. I would again like to quote a case study which was presented to the working party. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lisa had been a member of a private health fund for several years. When she found out that she was pregnant, she went to see the staff at the insurance office about changing her policy from `single' to `family'. She was advised to wait until five to six months into her pregnancy before changing her policy. Her son was born nine weeks early and taken to a special care nursery. The day after he was born, a nurse told Lisa that her son was not covered under the family cover of her private health insurance and that he had to be transferred to a public facility. Lisa was too stressed and too weary from drugs to take any action at that stage. Nine days later her son died. Two months after the burial she went to her health fund to claim for a share of the funeral costs, which were about 750 dollars. She was very disappointed and distressed to hear that she was not eligible for any reimbursement. She feels that she tried to do the right thing&mdash;she inquired about cover as soon as she knew that she was pregnant and was never advised that if born prematurely the child would not be covered by her policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">She wrote to the claims manager and after six months(!) she received a small amount of an ex gratia payment&mdash;not "because I was entitled to it as the manager said, but because he felt sorry for us. That made me feel even worse."</PARA>
<PARA>That is fairly typical of a lot of the insurance companies, particularly the larger ones. I have a small fund in my area that I think is very consumer friendly, but a lot of them do not provide the right information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also provide a private patient's hospital charter, which is fundamental. People need to know what their rights and entitlements are. I think this is extremely important. It will also include an independent complaints mechanism. Where do people complain to? We now have complaints mechanisms, ombudsmen and whatever in almost every field, and we have certainly long needed one in the private health insurance area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also provide better value for money in dealing with episodes in hospital. Under the system where contracts will be engaged with hospitals for particular treatments and for the criteria of quality of care, people will hopefully be fully covered. If they are not fully covered, they will know how much they are going to be out of pocket. If the particular case is going to be variable, at least they will know that. They will go in knowing what it is going to cost, if anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contracts with doctors will also be entered into and they can, if necessary, be above the medical benefits schedule. The medical benefits schedule is being reviewed and there may be changes to that. One of the problems is that most, but not all, doctors charge above the medical benefits schedule; some charge an enormous amount above the medical benefits schedule. So that will also help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Informed financial consent is another issue. It will be voluntary for doctors, but the AMA has indicated that it will work on this issue. A doctor will give a quote. The previous speaker talked about being able to choose your own plumber. Would you get plumbing done in your house without getting a quote? No. You would not get a carpenter to do some work without a quote. You would not get your house rewired without a quote. So why the hell would you go into hospital and have a major operation and not know what it is going to cost? It amazes me. We have believed for too long that doctors are some kind of god, that they know best and we must do what they say&mdash;and we do not even know what we will have to pay, if anything.

To some people elective surgery might mean a facelift or something, but elective surgery can still remove grave pain and suffering. Anyone who knows people with hip joint arthritis or, more importantly, blindness through cataracts knows how important so-called elective surgery is to those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember a letter I received when I was shadow minister for health from a woman who said, `I have been compelled to remain in darkness for another 18 months because there are no beds for me in Western Australia so that I can have my cataracts treated.' That is an outrageous circumstance, but those circumstances do occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is suggesting that this is the fault of the state system. In other words, year after year the Commonwealth is entitled to reduce funding to state governments but is entitled to demand, in the area where it has taken unto itself the responsibility, that those governments maintain a gold plated service. How would they do that? Quite obviously they could do it by taking money away from education, police services or one of their other areas of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day we had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) here boasting about how the Commonwealth's total outlays have been reduced as a percentage of GDP when we know that Commonwealth owned purpose outlays have continued to grow as a percentage of GDP. That result has been achieved by starving state governments of the funding that they were traditionally given. The argument of the honourable member for Macquarie has just no foundation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument went further. We were told about the states getting all this extra road funding because the government put $350 million into general purpose funding. But the budget tells us clearly that the government also reduced overall outlays to the states by the exact equivalent amount&mdash;$350 million. Yet the honourable member for Macquarie said that it is all the fault of the New South Wales state government. We will find out how Mr Carr will deal with it should he ever achieve government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now address the legislation. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in her second reading speech drew attention to the fact that Medicare has the support of 87 per cent of the community. That is not surprising when one looks at the questions that were asked. One question was, `Do you like Medicare?' It is something for nothing so of course people like Medicare. But they have never been asked whether they would prefer certain other options, so that makes a farce of that particular claim which is so oft repeated. People were asked in a motherhood situation whether they liked it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing people were not told at the time was what the true value of the Medicare levy is. We have been told that it is 1.4 per cent and that it does not apply to certain low income groups, but if we take the budget outlays figure on health&mdash;this is not exactly accurate as it is very difficult to get the exact figure to make the point so I am prepared to discount it somewhat&mdash;of $17.2 billion, and divide it by the total of personal income tax, which is $54.4 billion, that makes the Medicare levy 31 per cent of personal income, which the Medicare levy is only applied to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us discount that down to 25 per cent. It is a far cry from 1.4 per cent. That is a point well worth understanding in the community. We have a hugely expensive operation. It is totally ridiculous to make these international comparisons of percentages of GDP, because systems vary around the world. How do we achieve that percentage of GDP? By rationing services. Medical equipment is still prohibited from being imported into this country because of the government's fear of what it might cost the community if it were available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister refers to private health insurance as a supplement to the public health system. It is some supplement when you are waiting for a cataract operation or a hip replacement. Private health insurance would be better described as the only guarantee available to Australia's elderly for the relief of pain and suffering. That guarantee does not exist under the Medicare system if you just happen to have your suffering defined as elective surgery. What is more, it is a right that is getting further and further from the reach of elderly Australians every year that Medicare exists. That is what the government is now trying to address, but it has failed to do so with these minor, peripheral amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the history of federal government expenditure on health during the life of Medicare. In 1982-83 the Australian parliament authorised the expenditure of $3,399 million on health; $3,702 million on education; and $4,701 million on defence. Defence got a bit over a billion more than health. Education&mdash;something that most people would consider of grave importance to the youth of Australia, the people who must pay off the accumulated debts of the Keating government&mdash;also got substantially more than health, some $300 million. What are these figures today? If we look at the budget outlays we find that defence gets $9.6 billion; education gets $10 billion; and health gets $17.276 billion. So between 1982-83 and now expenditure on health has almost become equal to the sum of the expenditure in the other two areas. Who has paid for that? To a degree it has been the taxpayer, as I point out, with that massive levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we accept that the present levels of taxation are reasonable, the consumers of education have lost and the defence of our country has lost, in relative terms, to the voracious, uncontrolled appetite of the Medicare system. That is the reality of it all. What is more, when we look at the government's own projections for 1997-98, we suddenly find defence getting $10 billion, education getting nearly $11 billion, and health getting $20 billion. In 12 or 14 years health expenditure will have achieved a doubling in relative terms&mdash;not just in outlays. If we want an added shocker to that&mdash;remembering that defence and education will get about $10 billion each&mdash;we might also like to look at public debt interest, which will also be about $10 billion. We can only speculate on what that is robbing from our education system, our infrastructure, our road systems, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the system is that the other areas of our outlays are being robbed right and left by the voracious appetite of this health system. Everybody knows that, but it has to be looked at in the context that the government set out deliberately to do this. I well remember when the then minister Dr Blewett ran around this place saying, `Give me two terms of office with Medicare and I will wipe out the private health system.' Many of the things that we are trying to address today with regard to private health were deliberately put into the system to accelerate that activity. The government is now desperately concerned about what is starting to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the comments of one of the world's leading health administrators who, when I was shadow minister for health, was the keynote speaker at a conference in Sydney. I got a copy of her speech and I can produce it to anyone who doubts the following remarks. During that address she said, `We have 50,000 people on the waiting lists for public hospital admission in New Zealand. Waiting lists are the means by which we ration public hospital services.' She made no bones about that being the way to control the cost. You just do not let people into hospital. You do not let the most modern equipment come into your country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She went on to complain about the administration of the lists, pointing out that certain people who were in the know&mdash;who were ministers of the Crown, senior public servants or who knew somebody who knew somebody&mdash;were able to queue jump, and we have seen that happen in this very city. She was very critical of that. A fundamental of this sort of health policy is that, if you are a Prime Minister, you do not need private health care because you are going to get the very best from the public system, whether you ask for it or not.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to a former member of this place who once broke a tooth off in China and was taken to Mao Tse-Tung's private dental clinic. He said that he had never seen anything so elaborate in his life, but one could imagine how the peasants were getting treated for their dental problems out in the villages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get down to the fundamentals of this problem. The government and, might I say, the opposition support the concept of community rating on the morally correct principle that the healthy, which you could read as `the young', should pay for the sick, which you could read as `the elderly'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I understand and support this principle, I am also aware of the practical result when you combine the following principles. The first principle is a compulsory government scheme called Medicare, which is an excellent response mechanism to urgent medical conditions which principally afflict the young in any relative sense. The second principle is a private health scheme. It is severely restricted in its activities and ability to properly reimburse its contributors. I have already mentioned that the law prevents those contributors from making certain payments. The scheme forces the young and old to make cash contributions for medical services over and above their premium and Medicare levy, whilst those entering hospital under Medicare make absolutely no extra payments. The honourable member for Macquarie gave us an example of that earlier. The third principle is a common premium system that gives no incentive to those who join early nor puts any premium upon those who join late and where no apparent incentive is provided by government through, say, tax relief to equalise this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result is a massive defection of the young and healthy from private health cover. In the current situation of high interest rates and job insecurity, people are confronted with a premium cost of approximately $1,500 per annum and a guarantee that they will pay more when entering hospital and gain absolutely no benefit or penalty if they enter the private health system when they reach the danger zone of, say, 55 years of age. Clearly, if they have any brains at all, they will abandon private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wise, who can afford it, would bank the premiums to use in their old age, thus further improving their position. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might like to think quickly of what that would mean. If 20-year-olds banked their $1,500 a year and accumulated the interest, they would probably have $100,000 in the bank when they reached the age of 55, and that might be sufficient to fund their own health problems. The silly thing about the current system is that, at that point, they can join a private health company and receive absolutely no penalty for keeping their money while others paid in but did not use the service because they were young. We have no system that allows even for younger families to buy health cover for their old age. There is no system whereby when you are young and healthy you can say, `Look, I want to pay a premium now of $2,000 or $3,000 a year but I want to be guaranteed private health in my old age at no cost.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be addressing those sorts of matters. The tragedy of the present arrangements is that, as the young are departing the system and premiums are escalating because the elderly are putting demands on the system, many elderly people who have paid premiums all their working life are now unable to gain the protection of access to hospitals through private health. They cannot afford it. To the contrary, as the young leave the system in droves with the consequent upward movement on premiums, elderly members who have paid their private health premiums throughout their working lives suddenly find they can no longer afford private health cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Medicare was introduced, some 65 per cent of Australians were privately insured and were able to pay public and private hospitals for their services. The balance found no difficulty in gaining access to Australia's extensive public hospital teaching system. As I have said, the minister at the time said that, given two terms of office, he could destroy all that. He succeeded but he has created a disaster for the government because it cannot handle the expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures before the House today demonstrate how foolish that proposal was and how desperate this government is to stem the haemorrhage from private health funds. As I said, the 1983 level of 65 per cent for private health membership has now declined to 36 per cent and is falling per month. This highlights another myth propounded by the government: that the departure of the young from private health did not matter as they would not burden the public health system because they would not get sick very often. Such a claim is only partially correct because the young, particularly those of child-bearing age, put a substantial pressure on health costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem for public health is that, as the young defect, the elderly are being forced out. Those elderly people represent a massive cost to and demand on public health facilities as they get forced out of private health because they are unable to afford private insurance as a result of the reduced contribution of the young. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of the measures put forward today address these fundamental problems and, at best, fiddle at the margins. What do they offer? Private health funds may at this point enter preferred provider deals with hospitals, presumably so as to remove any additional charges flowing to members. It is frequent when we go to hospital&mdash;as I have done on occasions&mdash;to have no hospital bill if privately insured but a doctor's bill. That is in common use today. So the centrepiece of this measure is to formalise something that has been happening for a long time. It raises some questions as to how private funds will deal with those hospitals that do not sign up or that are not asked to sign up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of casemix, best defined as a fixed charge per episode of care, whilst not wrong in principle, ignores the age and condition of patients seeking such care. Basically, it requires the contracting hospital to process all patients at a fixed price, presumably within a fixed time and with deferred services. I wish it were so simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, this aspect of private fund dealing will have a minimal effect on fund outlays and will not stem the flow of private health defections by younger Australians. Put further: anything less than a halving of private health premiums to the young will not be a sufficient incentive. Neither patient nor the market will benefit from these types of deals and they should be subject to separate policy structures. Basically, the minister says that this will occur. That allows an opportunity to have HMOs. I do not criticise that option, but I think it was available to private funds previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the point made by the member for Macquarie that people should get a quote on their medical services. That is entirely appropriate. From my experience, it is something that many surgeons and doctors do today. They do it for their own protection so that they do not have disputes at the end of the day. I think that is quite appropriate but I wonder at the extent to which we had to make it compulsory. Either way, there is no real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem which is not addressed&mdash;a matter which we got a shellacking for at the last election and which Minister Howe tried to address with his co-payments&mdash;is that of free access to GP services. That has skewed health expenditures for first visits to medical practitioners and away from hospital services. I hold a simple view that there are many&mdash;but not all&mdash;Australians who can afford the price of a visit to a GP but not the huge costs associated with hospital treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet all of the process of Medicare as we know it today is skewing money to GPs because it is free. It is a foolish concept that would be better addressed in the context of the needs of individual people, to free up money for the hospital system where all the problems lie. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members cannot understand and appreciate the fact that even we on this side do not deny that Medicare, perhaps, is facing some challenges. But one of the things is&mdash;and it is not my personal opinion; it is statistics that prove it&mdash;that 70 per cent of Australia's population support Medicare. That is not my figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This figure is even more impressive when we compare it with overseas findings. One survey has shown that 56 per cent of Canadians believe their health system works well. Only 10 per cent of Americans believe the same of their health system, and the economic figures speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare covers 100 per cent of the Australian population for a cost of 8.6 per cent of our gross domestic product. The US health system covers nowhere near the same percentage of population, yet at the moment the US is spending 13.4 per cent of its GDP. Dr Peter Botsman has estimated that, if the United States had adopted a similar system to Australia's, it would have saved $4 trillion between 1992 and the year 2000. Canada, Finland and France all spend more on health care than Australia does, at less efficient rates of return. But this does not mean that Medicare cannot or should not be adjusted to suit changing circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with the decline in private insurance in a way which has drawn praise from the Australian Health Insurance Association and from the community generally. When Medicare was introduced some 11 years ago, it was intended that not less than 40 per cent of the Australian population would be covered by private health insurance. Up until recently, this has been the case. In 1993, for the very first time we saw the proportion of Australians covered by private insurance fall below 40 per cent. This is not a catastrophe of major proportions at the moment, as the majority of those who have dropped out of private insurance are young and healthy and have little call on our health system. But, as those who are not in private insurance begin to call on our health resources, it could become a pressing problem. It is the government's right to take action now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both sides of politics recognise the imperative of moving now to arrest the slide in the proportion of people covered by health insurance, but we disagree quite markedly on the method that should be used to do this. Before talking to the provisions of the bill in some detail, I think it would be worth while to provide some background to these issues by examining what the coalition proposes to do to fix the problem&mdash;although this will not be easy, as getting past the opposition's cliches to the substance of its policy has been a massive task since 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election&mdash;you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, would have to acknowledge this&mdash;the coalition promised to promote private health insurance by issuing credits to families with incomes below $30,000 which took out private insurance and tax penalties for families with incomes above $30,000 which chose not to take out private insurance. The coalition was also going to allow gap insurance. So the Liberal Party&mdash;the party of free enterprise, the party which falls over itself to pay homage to the markets&mdash;was going to subsidise a private industry with massive amounts of taxpayers' money, with no requirement for the insurers to provide improved services or greater efficiency. It would also have added to inflation and blown out the cost of private health insurance by allowing unfettered gap insurance&mdash;removing all constraints of price from the market and letting costs run wild. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is presently confusion in the opposition ranks about whether this is still the policy. The former shadow minister for health says it is not. The shadow parliamentary secretary, who many state has really been the brains of the outfit, says that it does remain policy. Yet all of this has contributed to the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) becoming the most spectacularly unsuccessful shadow minister since Peter Shack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enough of the foibles of the opposition. I would like to now turn in some detail to the provisions of the bill. This bill before the House will encourage individuals to take out private health insurance by allowing insurers to get a better deal for clients from doctors and hospitals. Under the present arrangements the funds pay the hospital amounts determined by the Commonwealth. The reform of this system will allow the funds, with their huge bargaining powers, to shop around for the most efficient services for their clients. If a hospital knows that it will have to reduce its prices to win the business of a major health fund, then the prices will come down as a matter of course. Naturally, all of the present safeguards will remain, and regulatory authorities will ensure appropriate standards in our hospitals. This will also introduce genuine competition between health insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, insurers can offer little substance to differentiate their product from that of any other insurer. Competition has degenerated into a contest over which insurer can come up with the catchiest jingle. The reforms proposed in this bill will allow consumers to choose the funds which can get them the best deal in hospital. I believe this will be of huge benefit to health insurers in attracting potential members. The Access Economics report to the AMA of December 1993 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of competition within the health insurance industry has an important bearing on cost performance . . . hope for the industry would appear to lie in deregulation and opening it up to competition.</PARA>
<PARA>This proposal has gained the approval of Mr Russell Schneider, the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, who has written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms will make health insurance more effective&mdash;and, in my view, more attractive&mdash;by changing the role of the health insurer from that of a passive player  to  an active  buyer  of  health services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a related move, it is proposed in this bill that health benefits organisations will be able to enter into agreements with medical practitioners for the provision of professional services in hospital which may eliminate out-of-pocket expenses or allow the patient to meet a predetermined amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discussion paper on the reform of private health insurance issued by the government in December 1993 identified the out-of-pocket expenses that people have to cover when they receive hospital care as the most important cause of the decline in private health insurance. Having to cover these significant costs has led people to believe, with some justification, that private health insurance does not represent value for money. In fact, the discussion paper found that the only more important reason for the decline in the proportion of people with private insurance is the economic pressure caused by increasing premiums. It is obvious that this reform will do much to enable health benefits organisations to make themselves more attractive to potential customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very positive reform contained in this bill is the replacement of benefits which are paid on a per diem basis with payments which cover the total period of patient care. In other words, a person will receive just one bill after a hospital visit. Under existing arrangements, patients could get several bills for one stay in hospital: a bill from each individual doctor involved in the case, bed charges, theatre charges, fees for pathology, and so on. Often those bills trickle in for months after the hospital visit, giving patients unpleasant surprises when they thought the costs were well behind them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new system proposed by the legislation before the House, a patient will know that all expenses have been paid for upon the payment of the initial bill. I am also pleased that, in future, patients will be forewarned of what costs they are likely to face before they enter hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In consultation with representatives of the professions, the government will establish a process by which medical professionals will outline to prospective patients what they can expect to pay before they enter hospital. I believe our Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) got it in one when she said in August last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You don't put your car in for a service without knowing what it's likely to cost. The same should apply for a hospital visit.</PARA>
<PARA>This reform will put a degree of power back into the hands of the consumer and correct an imbalance which has existed in the market for some time. The proposal to institute an independent Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner will emulate the success of similar ventures in other industries, such as the banking ombudsman. This reform will be accompanied by the development of a private patients hospital charter, which will be written in consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charter will explain in plain English the rights of private patients and the standard of service that they have a right to expect from their health funds, doctors and hospitals. These reforms will give consumers two mechanisms for dealing with any concerns that they may have about their treatment by the health industry: a document clearly setting out their rights and an independent arbiter who can investigate their concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with some very complex matters in a very sensible and effective way. I congratulate the Minister for Human Services and Health on the presentation of this bill. It is a bill which will improve the best health system in the world by increasing competition and efficiency. Health care consumers will benefit from the improved services which arise out of heightened competition. They will have reduced costs, a better billing system, a mechanism for knowing how much they will need to pay, and a process for lodging complaints about health treatment within the private health care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the policy that the opposition could never have proposed. The opposition is stuck on the simplistic and hugely expensive tactic of using the tax system to subsidise private insurance&mdash;an unsustainable policy attempting to attain an unachievable result; a form of industry protection more widespread than any quota and more insidious than any tariff. This bill, on the other hand, will mean that the private health insurance industry will survive because it will deliver real benefits to its clients. Individuals will have many more reasons for taking out private health insurance. Those individuals, the health care system and the nation will be all the better for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commending the bill before the House, and certainly speaking in opposition to the amendment, I would like to place on record that, finally, we have something that has the name of the previous spokesperson for health, the honourable member for Mackellar, on it. It is nothing more than a shopping list introduced with the words `the following assertions of principle are agreed to'. They are not principles that 70 per cent of the Australian public want. They are not principles that those who support Medicare, and have agreed that it is second to none in the world, want. What the people at large want&mdash;the people that we represent&mdash;is a concise bill that is going to benefit them in the long run, that is going to make sure that freedom and competition is available; but, most particularly, they want also a guarantee to those who have taken out the insurance cost that they will not have other costs to contend with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a very succinct bill. It has followed ongoing consultation with the industry at large, and particularly with the insurance companies. It is the most practical way of overcoming the problems that we are starting to see in our health system in Australia. I commend the bill to the House. I congratulate all those who have had a part in it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this is not just a bill that will disadvantage many women&mdash;especially women from the country.

It is important that the Keating Labor government's cynical attempt to undermine the quality and availability of health care to all Australians be fully exposed. This government must be held accountable to the Australian community for the deceptive manner in which it is seeking to re-engineer the delivery of health care in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health care under Labor has been driven, in my view, by two factors. The first factor is an ideological desire to control every aspect of every Australian's life; to remove the principle of choice and the principle of self-determination that has long been held dear by all Australians. The second factor is the saving of money or budgetary considerations above the delivery of services that go to affect many people in devastating ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been cavalier in the way it spends the taxes of the Australian people, flinging money around in cynical exercises to win votes. Yet, in the serious business of the nation's health, its primary consideration is to cut the quality of services to the sick and the vulnerable. This is not to say that sound economic management of the health budget cannot be equated with good doctoring and best practice medical care. I support the process of a well-structured and economic reform but not at the expense of the delivery of caring health services. The proposals outlined in these bills do not provide any guarantees or instil confidence that individual Australians can expect to receive better quality, or more timely access to, or more affordable health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government will not reduce its own expenditure and is now proposing the introduction of yet another new tax in the form of the private health insurance complaints levy. Perhaps the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) should study the real situation occurring in the states before imposing yet another burden on ordinary people. In a speech in the Victorian parliament on 14 September 1994, the Victorian Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Dr Denis Napthine MLA, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the decline in private health insurance is putting more people on our public hospital demand list, and Victoria is having to deal with that . . .

The disregard for the sensitivities of those suffering from poor health is a recipe guaranteed to increase the pain, suffering and anxiety of individuals and their families, and that is the hallmark of these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When asked at a recent meeting of GPs to comment on this aspect of the government's reforms and about what people would do after the operation for after-care or if they did not like the particular service being offered by the health fund, the minister for health allegedly replied, `If you're not happy with the hospital chosen by your health fund and the services provided, you can negotiate another arrangement with your insurer.' Is the health minister really serious when she makes this suggestion? Does she really expect people, when confronted with a major medical crisis, to enter into a bargaining process with their private health insurer to ensure that they get their preferred hospital and doctor? Is this the sort of free choice that will encourage more Australians to invest in private health insurance? What negotiating or market power will individual health consumers have at a time of high stress and anxiety associated with their sickness or that of a family member?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private health users will be led by the services on offer from the fund. Under duress, if they are not satisfied with the options provided by the fund, they would have limited recourse. As the reason for purchasing any form of insurance is to gain protection from a specific risk, consumers will question the wisdom of continuing to pay for private health insurance if the premiums do not provide an appropriate response to the risk exposure. That is simple cost-benefit analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the private health insurance industry well knows, consumers react very quickly to price. This is well illustrated in the Australian Bureau of Statistics health insurance survey of June 1992, which found that 67 per cent of those who discontinued their membership did so because they were unable to afford the payments. Basically, Australians opting for private cover would not mind paying more for an improved outcome but they do not deserve to be hoodwinked by this government. It is again worth noting the views of the National Association of Private Hospitals on this bill. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the proposed reforms would lead to a private healthcare system presently focussed on the provision of the highest standards of care for the patients, to one focussed on cost containment and extremely powerful health insurance funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, big business will be the recipient of the Labor government's policy. The smaller&mdash;and, I might say, more often efficient&mdash;funds would disappear. In my state a small fund, the Goldfields Medical Fund, has shown great efficiency and innovation, and the ability to offer value for money. It is this style of small private health funds that is threatened with extinction. They are the endangered species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned for the future of hospitals such as the Undercliffe Hospital Complex, located in Greenmount in my electorate in Western Australia. It is a classic example of a very good, small, acute private hospital that is under threat as a consequence of these bills. The arrogant manner in which this government is rushing these bills through the parliament is further proof that it has lost touch with the needs of everyday Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are the health minister and the government now openly embracing and advocating the adoption of the US system of health delivery that they were so scathing about at the last election? Australians need to be convinced that these reforms will deliver better quality health care for all Australians; reduce hospital waiting lists; enable people to maintain their choice with respect to doctor and hospital; not lead to a deterioration in the provision of total health care services&mdash;I emphasise `total health care services'&mdash;not lead to increased post-operative pain and suffering caused by early discharge from hospital for economic rather than health-related reasons; ensure that the social basis of Australia's health care system remains a higher priority than economic, profit or political motives; lead to greater efficiencies in the cost of health care and private health insurance; not reduce the quality access and provisions of the range of health care options available to individuals in remote, rural and less populated areas; provide a service that does not discriminate against smaller, non-private hospitals and funds; and provide a safety net provision that ensures all communities retain access to comprehensive, high quality hospitals and health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aged, the chronically ill, women and children, members of large families, and young people are vitally concerned that this is not just a case of a smoke and mirrors policy developed by the Keating Labor government. Does the health minister seriously believe that she can swan around this parliament claiming that these reforms are budget neutral while, at the same time, promising lower premiums for private health insurance? Are these promises not mutually exclusive or is the health minister simply acknowledging the fact that there will be no savings at all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health industry in Australia estimates that, for every one per cent of the population that opts out of private health cover, government health costs rise by an additional $100 million per year. If health consumers act in an economically rational manner, the lower premiums being promised by the health minister should lead to an increase in the number of Australians seeking private health insurance. Does a one per cent increase in the number of individuals taking out private health insurance not equate to a commensurate $100 million reduction in government health spending?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry research indicates that private health consumers are sensitive and react very quickly to price. In fact, they have been making that judgment since 1983 when Labor was first elected to federal government. In March 1983, 74 per cent of the population of Australia had private health insurance. In June 1994, this figure has fallen to only 37.2 per cent&mdash;a 50 per cent reduction. This is now below the 40 per cent figure quoted by the previous health minister, former Senator Richardson, that would be necessary for Medicare to work. Something needs to be done&mdash;and quickly.

<PARA>If the health minister's economic model can account for the complexities and complications associated with major surgery and pre- and post-operative care and support requirements, then running up a few calculations to fully inform everyone of the future cost savings should be a piece of cake. It should not be any difficulty at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to suggest to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the health minister, as a show of confidence in the reforms being proposed, that they instruct their party colleagues to lead by example and immediately rejoin private health schemes as a public expression of confidence in the strength of these reforms. They also have a moral obligation to look after their own health costs so that less fortunate Australians can gain priority access to scarce hospital beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that the health minister has perfected the art of the con so aptly portrayed by her former state Labor colleague Keith Wilson, who was the Western Australian Labor health minister during the period 1988 to 1992, including most of that period that Dr Lawrence was Premier of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the December 1994 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">FACTS</EMPHASIS>, a copy of which I have here, the quarterly newsletter of the National Civic Council WA Division, Keith Wilson, the former Labor health minister from Western Australia under the Lawrence government&mdash;one of Labor's own&mdash;finally exposed the truth of Labor's practices. His article in this publication, entitled `The Medicare "Con"&mdash;Ten Years of Deception' laid bare for all to see Labor's health care principles. I think we should share some of Keith Wilson's comments today. In part of this article he said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of Australia have not been in a position to deliver a true vote on Medicare because they have been kept in the dark, particularly about its cost.</PARA>
<PARA>Really, isn't that a very nice touch from the former Western Australian Labor health minister, who just happened to be the health minister during the current federal health minister's term as Premier of Western Australia? Do we assume that Keith Wilson was acting as a sole agent in the delivery of Western Australian Labor Party's health policy, or should we accept the more reasonable assumption that his Premier and party colleagues were part of the deception which he refers to? Perhaps this quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 30 May 1992 will reveal all. It states:</PARA>

Why should Australians believe that the health minister's principles are any different now from what they were during her term as Premier of Western Australia? Will the health minister give a guarantee to all Australians that the cost of administering these reforms will not create another expensive bureaucracy? Can the minister advise how there can be no cost increases to health consumers when industry research indicates that the implementation of the casemix aspect of these reforms alone could cost up to $150,000 per hospital? Will the health minister give a guarantee that the private health insurance complaints levy will not be increased by stealth from the initial level of $1 per member per annum? Will the Private Health Insurance Complaints Tribunal be a totally independent and accountable body, or will it be subject to the health ministerial direction and control?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consideration of these bills has raised too many issues of concern that the health minister has not been able to address in this parliament for us to have the confidence that Labor's deceptive practices referred to by the former health minister in Western Australia, Labor's Keith Wilson, will not continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Private Hospitals Association has made comments about and raised serious concerns about the bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also raises many concerns about the future competitive environment for small niche medical facilities and non-profit hospitals.

The number of private acute hospitals Australia-wide in a similar category to the Berwick Hospital&mdash;that is, zero to 50 beds&mdash;is 172, or 59 per cent of all private acute hospitals in Australia.

But at the same time we have people from the opposition coming in here trying to tell us how to run a health system. If there is one group of people in Australia with the least amount of credibility to talk about anything, let alone health, it is the opposition. Have we not heard some nonsense in the last day or so from it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly interesting that the last three opposition speakers, and the next speaker, all come from Western Australia&mdash;the discredited Western Australian Liberal Party. They were in here yesterday whingeing about tax&mdash;these are the people who do not believe in paying any tax. These are the same people from the discredited Western Australian Liberal Party who did not want to elect the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as their leader, because when he was Treasurer he found himself having to make them pay some tax&mdash;mind you, fairly belatedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I lived in Western Australia&mdash;I notice the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) is leaving&mdash;and worked in the health system, I remember the Liberal Party's campaign slogans; things like `Taxation is theft'. They thought it was an affront for Western Australian Liberal business people to have to pay any tax at all. Now they are coming in here and telling us about government policy and how to run a health system. I will say more about that later, but it does seem as though the Western Australian Liberal Party has a particular fixation and obsession with the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). They are all in here at every opportunity trying to get stuck into her for parochial reasons in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put on the record that if I were minister for health I would not waste my time with these opposition people, the way they are carrying on. They have no credibility on health, especially on health policy, after their 12 years in opposition. We still have not seen what their policy is, so let us stop this nonsense once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 seek to amend three longstanding acts of parliament&mdash;the National Health Act 1953, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973. The bills will give effect to the government's package of reforms to private health insurance in this country. These reforms provide better value for money for consumers of private insurance, greater efficiency and equity of access to private insurance, and a wider choice of cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say from the outset that I have never been a great supporter of private health insurance or, for that matter, of the private sector generally when it comes to the provision of health services. Health care is one of the most vital of all essential services that all Australians have a right to expect governments to provide, regardless of one's economic status.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it can be argued that ideological labels are of little use or relevance in the 1990s, I make no apology for saying that when it comes to health care and health insurance I am very much a socialist. Yes, that is right&mdash;a socialist. This is because I do not believe that it is morally or philosophically appropriate for people's access to quality health care or medical treatment to be subject to the profit motive or market forces. After all, in many cases we are talking about people's lives. Access to health care is a fundamental human right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I recognise the realities of our current health system and the role that private health insurance does play in providing the option of additional cover for those who feel they need it and can afford to pay for it. Medicare is the most equitable and efficient health system Australia has ever had, and it is world renowned as well, as we all know. Introduced by the Hawke government in 1984 as a cornerstone of the prices and incomes accord, Medicare built on the introduction of Medibank by the Whitlam government in 1975. Of course, Medibank was gradually dismantled by the Fraser coalition government between 1976 and 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare remains the centrepiece of this government's health policy and enjoys strong community support&mdash;stronger than ever, in fact. The latest market survey shows that over 87 per cent of the Australian population supports Medicare. I notice that even the opposition is now claiming to support it, although we can see how sincere it is in its so-called support for Medicare when we look at its record over the last 12 years when it has tried to dismantle and discredit it at every federal election campaign. But now of course opposition members can see the writing on the wall. Eighty-seven per cent speaks for itself, so the opposition now says, anyway, that it supports Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare provides a universal, accessible, equitable and high quality public health system for all Australians, notwithstanding the problems sometimes experienced in various hospital systems, which I might point out are of course run by state governments. Of all the great social justice reforms introduced by this federal Labor government since 1983, none has been more important nor stood the test of time better than Medicare. The corollary to that is that in no area of policy has the opposition lacked credibility more than it does in the area of health policy. That does not mean that this government cannot or will not continue to work at making Medicare even better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Fraser government years when the current Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, was Treasurer, Australia lurched from one health insurance system to the next. The coalition was determined to destroy Medibank because of its philosophical opposition to a universal, national public health system. But its attempts to replace it with a return to the old subsidised private health insurance system were disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember this period quite well, and I can speak with some authority on the period because from 1976 to 1983 I worked in the health insurance industry as a Commonwealth officer with the health department. I was involved in administering the various health insurance systems which were heavily subsidised by the taxpayer although run by private health funds. That period from 1976 to 1983 included, I might say, a lengthy period in the Western Australian office of the health department. I recall that in Western Australia at the time the Hospital Benefits Fund of Western Australia accounted for about 80 per cent of the health insurance market, which gave it almost a monopoly in private health insurance. So much for competition and efficiency in the private health insurance sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was also the period&mdash;the Fraser years, when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer&mdash;when medical fraud and overservicing first reared their ugly heads as a major drain on Commonwealth revenue, as I have discussed on many occasions in this House. My experience of this period has certainly contributed to my strong philosophical views on health, which I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the introduction of Medicare in 1984, the private health funds ceased to receive government money and gradually ceased to be regulated by the government to the extent they had been previously. Private funds have continued to provide additional hospital cover for their contributors and have diversified into a range of other areas of ancillary cover, such as for dental and chiropractic treatment and other things, as well as non-health insurance products. It is fair to say that this has enabled the private health insurance sector to remain viable and make a useful contribution to the Australian health system. I continue to have ancillary private health cover, albeit with the government owned fund&mdash;Medibank Private&mdash;for dental and chiropractic services not covered in the Medicare benefits schedule. However, like many other people, I have dropped my private hospital cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many workers are still well served by workplace based private funds, such as the Teachers Federation health society and the Reserve Bank health fund, to mention just a couple, which offer cheap premiums for those in the respective industries. As the Minister for Human Services and Health said in her second reading speech, private health insurance offers a chance for those who want it, but it must be seen for what it is&mdash;a supplement to the public system, to Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues which has arisen and which led to the reforms contained in this bill is the fact that membership levels in private health funds have fallen. In many ways this can be attributed to the outstanding success of Medicare. Considering what I have said earlier about my own view, one could be tempted to ask the question: why should we worry about the drop in private health insurance membership? Does it not simply show that Medicare is successful and is doing its job and that people do not need the additional cover? Although that is an attractive argument to some extent, it is fair to say that there are other causes for the drop in the numbers of privately insured which in itself creates some problems, which I will mention later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking mainly here about hospital cover, which is the main area of private insurance. Private insurance can provide access to a private hospital bed, a private room in a public hospital, and the choice of doctor where practicable. While it is true that the drop in the numbers of privately insured people is partly due to the success of Medicare, it is also due to a major anomaly in the current system. This is the fact that, while a Medicare only patient incurs no charge for hospital treatment, a patient receiving the same treatment in the same hospital from the same doctor or specialist can be up for all sorts of out-of-pocket expenses over and above those covered either by Medicare or by their private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and, I am sure, most honourable members have heard of many cases where patients have undergone surgery, in some cases emergency surgery, and have been left with a bill for over $10,000 for out-of-pocket expenses, simply because they were private patients, that is, members of a private fund, yet their private insurance cover does not extend to these out-of-pocket expenses. So a patient who pays only the Medicare levy pays nothing, yet a patient who pays the Medicare levy plus private health insurance premiums receives a doctor's bill from the specialist or the surgeon&mdash;not all of which is covered by Medicare, as most specialists do not bulk-bill, as we all know&mdash;and on top of that a hospital bill for out-of-pocket hospital expenses which are not covered by any private health tables. Regardless of whether you philosophically support private insurance or not, this situation is clearly unfair and has been a contributing factor in the decline in the numbers of the privately insured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the question of why this decline in itself is a problem. The reality is that, with more people opting for Medicare only cover, this puts a potential and an actual additional strain on the public hospital system leading, in some instances, to excessive waiting lists in public hospitals. Quite properly, emergency surgery takes priority over so-called elective surgery in public hospital queues, so we have had much publicity from time to time about long waiting lists for operations which are not considered to be emergencies. While much of the negative publicity about public hospital waiting lists is at best inaccurate and misleading and at worst an exercise in propaganda by surgeons, private health insurance funds, the AMA, conservative state governments, and other opponents of Medicare, the fact remains that there are only so many public beds to go around, while many beds in private hospitals are underutilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key elements of this bill is the opportunity for contractual agreements between health insurance funds, doctors and hospitals. These contracts will provide for patients to receive a single bill for all components of a hospital episode. This may be covered by private insurance, thus eliminating the problem of uninsured, out-of-pocket expenses. Hospital charges under this process will be based on the casemix model. Levels of cover will vary according to the contracts and the level sought by the consumer, but an important feature is that all costs will be known to the patient in advance. This will remove the inequities of uninsured, out-of-pocket expenses that have contributed to the decline in the number of privately insured people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Privately insured patients will also have more flexibility with a greater range of products. These measures should also serve to reduce premiums for private insurance, which has been another factor in declining insurance levels. Private health insurance will now be a more attractive option for those who can afford to pay but who have been turning away from private insurance for the reasons I have outlined. At the same time, this will go some way towards ensuring that Medicare-only patients will have ready access to high quality treatment in public hospitals without the prospect of excessive waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of this bill will provide greater consumer protection, equity of access for consumers and&mdash;very  importantly&mdash;greater administrative efficiency in both the public and private health sectors. The effect of the measures in this bill will be to reduce the overall cost of our health system to government and the community, and to make it more cost effective. We hear a lot from people in the community, the opposition and elsewhere about the cost of Medicare. As I said, Medicare is the most successful system we have had, but it is also true that it is in all our interests to contain the cost both to the revenue and to consumers of our health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the success and popularity of Medicare, its cost to the taxpayer is still increasing by up to 10 per cent a year. Most of these increased budgetary outlays end up in the pockets of doctors and private hospitals, through increased utilisation of medical services combined with our fee-for-service system&mdash;which, as I have said before, has its own problems&mdash;and the anomalies in the system, which this bill seeks to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The casemix model, which is the basis for the reforms in this bill, will have a positive impact on total health costs,&mdash;certainly in the case of hospital treatment&mdash;and will not reduce but, in fact, enhance the overall quality of care for all patients. This is very important in the process of not only reform of the health system but micro-economic reform generally, combined with this Labor government's very proud program of social justice. It is very important to link social justice programs with economic efficiency and reform&mdash;and access and equity generally&mdash;from both a social and an economic point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is another bill that will go a long way towards that. For their part, opposition members can only come out with all this sort of nonsense and rhetoric. They attack the minister. They play the person rather than talk about the issues. Of course, they are incapable of talking about policies. They have no policies in the area of health&mdash;certainly no federal policies. They have been in opposition for 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have already seen, opposition members do not have policies on many things at all but health is one area in which they have even less credibility than they have in other areas. That is why it is so laughable that they come in here and oppose this bill, attack Medicare and the government's record, and try to score points about Medicare. I certainly commend this bill to the House. I look forward to the debate and the implementation of these progressive, well thought out and socially and economic responsible reforms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of parliament, one often invites constituents to identify their areas of greatest concern in relation to federal issues. One of the most common concerns relates to health. In the health area, one of the most common responses relates to health insurance. Health insurance is a difficult issue for many people in many different situations, such as the young, the unemployed, the family and, particularly, the elderly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One significant area of concern&mdash;one which is promoted by failing government policies&mdash;is the trend where people drop private health cover and rely on the public health system. Despite the inadequacies of the public health system and the increasing strains being put upon it, people are prepared to drop their private health cover because they cannot see the point to it. In many cases they cannot see the point because it has anomalies and aspects that they do not understand. It is to be hoped that the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 may have some impact. However, given the doctrinaire and haphazard approach taken over the years by the government to health policy, one cannot be confident that any of the reforms proposed in this bill will solve the problems of the ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will confine my comments on this legislation to two principal matters&mdash;considerations of privacy and the proposed complaints commission. One of the proposed amendments will expand the functions of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. There are two aspects to that. First, the council will be required to collect and disseminate information about private health insurance for the purpose of enabling people to make informed choices about private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With the deregulation of the financial market, we have seen changes to the health insurance industry in general and health insurance participants in particular. It seems that people have a less than complete understanding of the manner in which insurers operate in the health insurance market nowadays as a result of that deregulation. Once private health fund companies operated effectively only in the discrete area of health insurance; now they cover a range of other activities. The nature of health cover offered is likely to vary considerably from one fund to another in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This requires a proper source of information for consumers of private health insurance services on what is available, what will be provided and what will not be covered. The role of the council is potentially very important; however, it is also important that the information provided to the public be in a consumer digestible form. It would be counterproductive if the present confusion among members of the public as to the nature of effective health cover were to be exacerbated by the statutory function of the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major function to be added to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council is that of the collection of information about patients for research purposes. The sort of data the council will be enabled to obtain will be dictated by the categories of information listed in the hospital casemix protocol. The protocol is yet to be prescribed, so it is not clear how detailed that information will be. It appears that it will relate to the detail of the medical services and the treatment provided to the individual patient. Where will the council obtain this data?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires registered health funds to submit data in accordance with the categories listed on the hospital casemix protocol. The funds are to submit the data to the Secretary to the Department of Human Services and Health and to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council within 28 days of the end of the month to which that data relates. The secretary will have discretion to agree to a longer time period for the provision of data if that is sought. In addition, the bill requires a hospital to provide information of the type specified in the hospital casemix protocol to the health fund with which that hospital has entered into a purchaser-provider agreement. There is provision in the bill for the secretary to the department to agree that the hospital does not have to provide all such information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the data will be used by the department and the council for the purposes of `modelling, evaluation and research'. There is no definition of these terms in the bill. We are not told what `modelling, evaluation and research' will entail. Nor are there any details of the measures that will be taken, if any, to protect the privacy of individual patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Medical Association has expressed its concerns to the coalition about patients' right to privacy. The government has not consulted with the AMA about the information which will be provided to the department and the council. The doctors have urged the government to give them some assurance that the information will be the absolute minimum that is required for the purposes stated in the bill, and that it would not allow individual patients or practitioners to be identified. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) gave no such assurance in her second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA has stressed that it is consistent with modern privacy standards in enlightened societies that any citizen ought to be able for any reason to refuse to have data concerning his or her health status transferred to the Commonwealth government in a routine manner. Most citizens would not seek to exercise this right, but it should be there to maintain standards and for recourse in the event of sensitive circumstances. The bill does not make provision for such a right. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a matter of serious concern that the minister appears not to have consulted the Privacy Commissioner in relation to the privacy aspects of the proposals in this bill. The department, in the preparation of legislation in recent times, has a very poor record in the protection of the rights of those affected by the measures that are proposed in bills emanating from the department, and this simply adds to that bleak record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, the coalition will be moving an amendment to provide for the Privacy Commissioner to issue guidelines in regard to the supply and use of data obtained from hospitals by registered health funds and passed on to the department and the council. The guidelines should be disallowable instruments to be considered by the parliament at the same time it considers the regulations that will prescribe the hospital casemix protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interests of privacy may, in fact, be better served by providing that registered health funds supply information initially to an independent data bureau. That bureau would take the responsibility for collecting, collating, editing, analysing and reporting to the department and the council, to state governments and to the health funds and hospitals. It may be appropriate for the Senate to consider this particular suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making these comments about the rights to privacy, it is not to be overlooked that information gathered from the sources in question may not only be very valuable for administrative purposes in introducing economies and efficiencies but also, potentially, have epidemiological value in the investigation of diseases, their causes and their cures. Any guidelines should take into account that interest but should ensure that appropriate privacy protections are included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill establishes the position of Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner and sets out the functions of that office. A complaint may be made about any matter in connection with a private health insurance arrangement and may be made by or on behalf of a health fund contributor, the hospital, a medical practitioner, or a registered health fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complaint acts as a trigger for an investigation. If the complaint is not resolved after the investigation, the complainant may request the commissioner to conciliate between the parties. The commissioner also has the power to commence an investigation of his or her own motion. If the commissioner is requested by the minister to begin an investigation, he or she must do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these last two situations, the commissioner may examine the records and rules of the health fund. The Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 imposes a levy on registered health funds to cover the administrative costs which may be incurred by the commissioner. The rate of the levy is to be based on the number of contributors to the fund, and so the cost will obviously be passed on directly to those contributors. The levy will be a new tax on patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, in consultation with the health funds, the coalition has received concerns about the impact of this new tax on the level of premiums. Research has shown that the two most common complaints about health funds relate to unexpected out-of-pocket expenses and the inability of health funds to differentiate between members on such matters as length of membership or history of claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the former complaint is that the health funds have been statutorily prevented from providing gap insurance. The reason for the second type of complaint is primarily the community rating principle which is enshrined in the health legislation. Neither of these matters is the fault of the health funds. It appears, therefore, unreasonable to expect members of health funds to pay for the establishment of the bureaucratic overlay in dealing with issues that really are matters of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic, given the government's stated aim of these private health insurance forms being to reduce the level of premiums, to encourage Australians to take out private health insurance. The effect appears likely to be to increase the level of premiums. For these reasons the coalition is opposing the levy bill and the new tax it seeks to impose on health fund contributors. I conclude by noting that in the main bill, which creates the position of complaints commissioner, provision ought to be made expressly for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions of the commissioner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opportunity to comment on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 is an opportunity to reflect upon the advances, or lack of advances, in the health system in Australia. I well recall the election of the Cain Labor government in 1982 in Victoria. The then Minister for Health, Tom Roper, who was given that position under the Cain administration, visited the electorate of Bendigo. He came to Echuca to open a new extension to a hospital wing. He said to the gathering at the opening that as the new minister he was indeed fortunate to have inherited the best health system in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

It did not take terribly long for the Labor government in Victoria&mdash;aided and abetted by the election in 1983 of the Hawke Labor government, when the Hon. Neal Blewett was appointed Minister for Health&mdash;to take what was regarded as the best health system in the world and drag it down to the situation we have in Australia today with long waiting lists for treatment in public hospitals, with restrictions and with the high costs of medical care impacting on people's pockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect on the previous 12 years and see just what has happened. Even in Victoria at this time the Kennett government is trying to repair damage that was created by consecutive Labor health ministers in the state government there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proclaimed aims of the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994 are, first, to reduce private health insurance premiums in order to stem the flow of those people leaving private health insurance; second, to allow greater competition between health funds by the introduction of new products; and, third, to introduce casemix funding for private hospitals. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot underestimate the importance of health legislation and health providers in this country. One has only to reflect on what happened in the recent USA elections to see just how important was health legislation in those elections. When asked why he was defeated, Mr Tom Foley, until then the Speaker of the House of Representatives&mdash;and the first Speaker to be defeated whilst in office in 50 years&mdash;said that the President, Mr Clinton, had handed over the responsibility of formulating a new health policy to his wife and a committee which he had drawn up, and he said that they did not get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the US, the backlash from the people saw the defeat of the Speaker of the House. Many other members of the Congress were also defeated, purely and simply on the basis of a lack of proper direction in the health system and the inability of people to pay for the health system in the United States. In many instances, the capacity to pay, and the shortage of beds in public hospitals, is leading to a similar situation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a survey which was carried out in December 1992. That was a very significant time, because the survey featured in the run-up to the 1993 federal election and the Australian Health Insurance Association Ltd was trying to ascertain what the general community's concerns were about health issues in this nation. The Australian Health Insurance Association carried out a number of surveys, and was kind enough to provide those survey results to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I wish to quote from attachment II which is headed `Support for Tax Assistance':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AHIA has assessed the extent to which the industry itself has the support of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An established market research group, Quadrant Research Services, was commissioned by the AHIA to conduct a number of surveys covering the five major States&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>so this was a very broad coverage of the whole of Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as well as selected federal electorates over a period from February to September 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The surveys were designed to determine community attitudes to a variety of health insurance issues, but most particularly the extent to which tax rebates were electorally popular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall the results showed a strong support for tax assistance, with 82 percent of the community, across the nation believing that people who have private health insurance should be entitled to rebate for the premiums they pay.</PARA>
<PARA>In the graph which accompanies this, it was remarkable how uniform the response was, state by state, right throughout Australia, virtually within one or two percentage points. The question asked was, `Do you believe that people who have private health insurance should be entitled to rebates for the premiums they pay?' The answer was a resounding yes and, of all the states, only in Queensland was the figure below 80 per cent; in South Australia almost 90 per cent of the community believed that there was need for some form of relief by way of tax rebates for private health insurance payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even greater was the belief that people would be more likely to take out private health insurance if they received a rebate for the premiums: 88 per cent of the nation supported this proposition. The question that was asked in the survey was, `Do you think that people would be more likely to take out private health insurance if they received a tax rebate for the premium?' The yes responses were very uniform. Most of them were up around the 90 per cent mark, with Victoria very high on 90 per cent. Once again, Queensland was slightly lower, at about 85 per cent. All the states were within a few percentage points of each other on that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just shows how importantly the Australian community regards this matter. The clear desire of the community is to retain private health insurance but people are looking for some form of relief from the high cost of those premiums. They like to have the choice of hospital.

I find that, on average, the minister is very slow to reply and in most instances refers it on to other ministers, either to the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) or to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) who does a bit of work in the health area as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures also attack the community rating principle by allowing contracts between health funds and contributors to exclude treatment for certain illnesses, for example, hip replacement and psychiatric treatment. In addition, there are privacy considerations, given that the provider agreements cannot be effective without the supply of patient information to the government through the health funds. It is for those reasons, and the reasons I have enumerated from the Australian Private Hospitals Association Ltd and the AMA, that the coalition is opposing these measures being introduced by the government. </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill simplifies the provisions in the Corporations Law concerning share buybacks, proprietary companies and company registers. It is the first step in a comprehensive program for the simplification of the Corporations Law. It demonstrates that the law can be made more accessible to ordinary people, to give them a grasp of the law's general principles and an appreciation of their rights and obligations under the law. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Simplification Program</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Law simplification program was established to reduce the complexity of the Corporations Law. Its primary goal is to improve access to the law and to make it capable of being understood by business and its other user groups. A particular aim is to produce a law which allows its users to obtain a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities without the need for costly legal advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simple laws also promote economic efficiency. The program aims to reduce the regulatory burden on business by eliminating unnecessary regulation. This will not be achieved at the expense of investor protection. The program examines regulatory requirements in the law and assesses whether they are necessary to meet the needs of business, investors and creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is the product of an extensive public consultative process, providing a model for the development of legislation. The day-to-day responsibility of the program rests with a four-person task force, comprising an experienced corporate lawyer, a plain English expert, a senior legislative drafter and a senior policy lawyer from my department. Their combined skills greatly benefit the program in the preparation of proposals for change, draft legislation and the final product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force works closely with a 14-person private sector consultative group. Representing a broad range of users of the law, the consultative group assists in providing the overall direction for the program and participates in the preparation of draft legislation. The role of the consultative group is supplemented by public consultation with the full range of users of the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been written with the principles of plain language firmly in mind. Provisions have been arranged in the order in which readers look for them. A more natural idiom is used. Sentence lengths and a more natural flow of sentences have been consciously chosen to aid reader understanding. Tables of provisions, notes and cross-references have been used to more closely integrate relevant areas of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will improve the presentation of the law and make provisions easier to find. For example,<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">headings have been placed at the top of each page; individual subsections are given headings;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">margins are wider and pages are made more `open', giving the text a less cluttered feel. The bill's explanatory memorandum is also more useful, allowing the reader to place individual provisions in their proposed context within the Corporations Law, rather than paraphrasing the text of the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some years now, many judges and other lawyers have rightly been calling for parliament to pass laws which are comprehensible and accessible for those who use those laws. This bill represents the first attempt to comprehensively deal with that concern in the corporate law area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the legal profession in general, and the courts in particular, will show support for this initiative by striving to apply the provisions in a straightforward and accessible fashion, and rejecting arguments based on unlikely constructions or excessively fine distinctions. The problem of complex laws is one that must be tackled by all those involved in the legal system. This bill, once enacted, will be a major contribution by the law makers in this parliament. But those who use and apply the law must also play their part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The easing of regulatory burdens is a significant element of the simplification program. At present, the share buyback provisions include rules aimed at insider trading and market manipulation. Other areas of the law already adequately address these matters. The bill will eliminate this unnecessary duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also the law currently requires companies to keep several different registers. These registers are costly to adequately maintain&mdash;indeed, many smaller companies do not&mdash;and are rarely inspected by the public. The bill will abolish five registers where the requirement to maintain the register is outdated or the information required is more easily obtained from the ASC or the ASX. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the law divides companies into public and proprietary companies, the law currently makes very little provision for the needs of small business. For small business, the bill will put into the law a guide to the rules concerning proprietary companies. The guide will function as an introduction to the law for the directors and shareholders of small companies, and will improve their understanding of and access to the law. The bill also makes the law more responsive to the needs of small business by making the financial reporting obligations of proprietary companies proportionate to their economic significance; by allowing proprietary companies to have only one member and one director; and by making annual general meetings optional for proprietary companies. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consultation and testing</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is the product of extensive consultations with a wide range of regular users of the law. These consultations commence with the involvement of private sector expertise in both the task force and the consultative group in the preparation of proposals which are released for public comment. The proposals and any comments received on them then form the basis of draft legislation, which is in turn exposed for public comment for at least three months. The task force meets regularly with representatives of the peak organisations which have a particular interest in the Corporations Law. Every aspect of the bill, from policy to drafting to layout, has also been extensively tested with small `focus groups' of users. In addition, public seminars have been held on the bill in most state capitals. The bill has been progressively refined as a result of comments received throughout this process. The result is a bill which is clear to its ordinary reader, and which also achieves the appropriate policy balance between those whose interests are affected by the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the detail of the three areas covered by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Share buybacks</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Law currently allows a company to buy back its own shares. However, the existing legislation has been criticised as being too long, complex and difficult to understand; it is more than 10 times longer than the equivalent legislation in comparable jurisdictions. It involves expensive and unnecessary procedural steps, and often there is duplication of regulation elsewhere in the law. Few companies have used the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Winding back unnecessary regulation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A company's ability to buy back its shares should only be subject to safeguards necessary to protect the interests of its creditors and shareholders. The existing rules establish procedures involving reports by auditors and other experts, advertisements and declarations. These impose costs on companies without conferring any real additional protection for creditors and shareholders. Most overseas jurisdictions do not require this. These rules will now be removed. Shareholders and creditors will be sufficiently protected by rules which focus on solvency, fairness between shareholders and disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will protect the interests of shareholders and creditors without imposing excessive compliance costs on business. It will also make the Australian rules concerning share buybacks closer to those which currently apply in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Proprietary companies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to ease the regulatory burden placed by the law on small business has long been recognised. In an effort to ease this burden, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities recommended in 1992 the creation of a new corporate structure, the `private company'. The government's response to the committee's report was tabled in the House on 8 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary committee was clearly right in its conclusion that the laws regulating small business need to be streamlined. Indeed, the government decided that this bill should simplify the existing regulation of all proprietary companies, achieving the benefits of the private company proposal without adding an additional corporate structure to the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should highlight the importance of the provisions in the bill which will enable sole traders to incorporate without the need to involve a second shareholder or director in the business. This amendment will alleviate a number of problems which have a particular impact on women who are involved in business. Reports over recent years suggest that women are heavily involved in small business and, in fact, are setting up their own businesses at a much faster rate than men. The current requirement for a minimum of two directors and shareholders for a company has presented significant practical difficulties for many women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, businesswomen may find it difficult to find another person willing to act as a director of their companies. They may be unwilling to have their husbands or partners as directors or shareholders out of a desire to retain a degree of independence within the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the minimum number requirement often leads to women becoming directors of companies controlled by their spouse in which they do not play any meaningful role. This can expose these women to the legal liabilities of a company director, without them having any influence over the operation of the company. As recent cases have shown, people acting as directors without being involved in the company's affairs can be responsible for the company's debts upon insolvency. The outcome is similar to the problem which results from `sexually transmitted debt' when a person acts as guarantor for the debts of their spouse. The bill will address these problems, and help women to establish themselves in business on their own terms. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial reporting by proprietary companies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major innovations in the bill deals with the preparation of accounts by proprietary companies. The bill bases financial reporting obligations on criteria relating to the economic significance of a company. It does this by introducing a distinction between small and large proprietary companies. A proprietary company will be `small' if it satisfies at least two criteria which relate to the company's turnover, assets and number of employees. The criteria are deliberately set at generous levels, in order to enable the vast majority of proprietary companies to take advantage of the reduced annual reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For companies below these thresholds, there will generally be no requirement under the Corporations Law to prepare annual financial statements. However, under the bill, proprietary companies will have to prepare annual financial statements if members holding at least five per cent of the voting shares so require or if the ASC so directs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of financial reporting requirements from the Corporations Law will enable small companies to focus on their actual accounting needs, rather than being compelled to comply with often superfluous Corporations Law obligations. This proposal has been favourably received by small business interests, which suggests that the potential savings will be worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Small business guide</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major initiative in the bill is the introduction of the small business guide. The guide is designed for people who operate small businesses and aims to help them understand their rights and responsibilities if they choose to incorporate their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other changes affecting small business</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also ease a number of other existing regulatory burdens for all proprietary companies. Proprietary companies will be able to pass a resolution if all of the members of the company sign a minute of the resolution, without needing to hold a formal meeting. In addition, these companies will not be required to hold an annual general meeting. This reform will remove from the law a procedure which is often a mere formality, and may be of little use to the members of a proprietary company. Finally, it will no longer be necessary for proprietary companies to restrict the transfer of their shares. Of course, some companies may prefer to restrict the transfer of their shares, and they will be free to continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Company registers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Law currently requires companies to keep a number of registers so the public can have access to certain information about the company and its officers. The regular updating of these registers can be a significant administrative burden, and often the registers are little used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the information in company registers must also be given to the ASC. In practice, it is quite simple for members of the public to access this information through the ASC's electronic searching facilities and through the Australian Stock Exchange&mdash;ASX&mdash;in the case of listed companies, rather than by going to a company's offices and searching registers kept by it. Where this is possible, the separate maintenance of registers by companies is an unnecessary duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the Corporations Law to remove the requirements that companies keep registers of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries, directors' shareholdings and buybacks, and that listed companies keep registers of substantial shareholders and notices of beneficial interests. In the case of directors' shareholdings, the outdated requirement that all companies keep a register of this information will be replaced by rules requiring directors of listed companies to disclose the information to the ASX. This will ensure that investors in those companies have rapid and easy access to information about directors' shareholdings, while at the same time lifting an unnecessary paperwork burden from the vast majority of companies whose shares are not actively traded. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Registers of members, option holders and debenture holders</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies will still have to keep registers relating to their members and debenture holders. Further, the register of options will become a register of option holders, to provide more relevant and up-to-date information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to concerns about the use of information from registers to invade the privacy of securities holders, such as through the compilation of mailing lists to send correspondence to them, the bill introduces a new provision which prohibits the misuse of information on those registers. Substantial sanctions, including criminal penalties and an account of profits, will become available in this area for the first time. This will represent a significant and practical safeguard for the privacy of those listed in these registers. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Directors' residential addresses</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some company directors have expressed concern that the publication of their residential address on the ASC's database may put their personal safety in danger. The Corporations Law should not put the physical safety of company officers at risk. The bill will therefore amend the law to enable the residential addresses of directors and secretaries to be suppressed from the database. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Electoral Act contains provisions which enable voters to have their addresses removed from the electoral roll where the public availability of this information would put their personal safety at risk, and the bill will introduce a similar scheme for company directors and secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bill will also require an alternative address to be publicly available to enable legal service to be effected. Company officers will also have to supply their residential addresses to the ASC, so that the ASC will be able to locate them if necessary and they are contactable in a situation where a judgment debt needs to be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goal of the simplification program is a law that works; a law that is more understandable and accessible; and a law that is easier for companies to comply with but that sufficiently protects shareholders, creditors and the wider public from the possible abuses of the corporate form. The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill is the first of a number of bills which will further this goal. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on one point. The government will be agreeing that this bill be referred to the Joint Committee on Securities and Corporations for its consideration. Although the government is agreeing to that course of action, I feel some reluctance. As I have outlined in this second reading speech, the consultative processes that have been undergone in order to get this bill to this stage have arguably been more extensive than for any other piece of legislation that this parliament has been asked to deal with. There is no question that the users of the law have been involved in the process of formulating this legislation, from the stage of the initial proposals which were put out for public comment, from the comments that were received on those proposals, to the development of the draft legislation, to a whole series of public seminars on the legislation throughout the country, to individual focus group testing of the provisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill is an important bill, the result of an important process. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has indicated, it is expected to be the first of a number of bills to simplify and reform the Corporations Law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Law is complex and voluminous legislation. It currently applies to all companies, regardless of their size, and has therefore become difficult for many companies to use. The usefulness of many of the rules upon which the Corporations Law is based has also been questioned as the nature of the corporate structure or the types of corporate structure have changed over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the Attorney-General established a task force consisting of experts and members of the professions to assist in simplifying the Corporations Law. A number of exposure drafts covering different areas of the Corporations Law have been produced by the task force and released. The second stage of the simplification program is expected to cover incorporation, accounts and audit, deregistration and investment companies. We are told by the government that a second simplification bill is planned for release in May of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is modelled on the first exposure draft. It comprises seven schedules and addresses, first, the ability of Australian companies to buy back their own shares; second, the provisions relating to proprietary companies; and, third, streamlining the requirements for company registers. The bill also includes something called the small business guide, which is a document aimed at small businesses and written in `plain English'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past it was considered that the purchase by companies of their own shares was undesirable. The main reason was the assumption that companies were assessed for their creditworthiness on the strength of issued shares and, therefore, the repurchase of shares might affect a company's borrowing capacity. Permitted buybacks, however, will allow a company that is in good financial shape to take advantage of market conditions and repurchase its shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Australian companies have been able to buy back their own shares under the Corporations Law since 1989, the current provisions are considered by practitioners to be cumbersome and costly. The current provisions run to some 90 sections and are almost unworkable and unnecessarily complex. Under the current Corporations Law, a broad prohibition applies. Companies can only buy back ordinary shares if a number of requirements are met. These requirements relate to the percentage of shares which can be bought back in any 12-month period, whether the company's articles of association permit the buyback, and the completion by the company's directors of a solvency declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill will retain the existing broad prohibition in the Corporations Law, but will replace the current conditions with modified requirements. These requirements are contained in 11 sections. The specifications in relation to the number of shares that may be acquired within 12 months will remain unchanged. The new provisions will allow a company to buy back its own shares, other than redeemable preference shares. The bill makes the buyback rules the same for all types of companies. Attached to the bill is a table to make easier the application of the various procedural requirements for the different types of buybacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the current procedures involving auditors, experts, advertisements and declarations, which are not required in many overseas jurisdictions, to be replaced with new safeguards. It is these current demanding requirements which make the existing buyback rules difficult to comply with and extraordinarily lengthy. Buybacks which will be allowed under the proposed provisions include odd lot, employee share, on-market, equal access and selective buyback schemes. There will be some provision for the Australian Securities Commission to become involved in schemes that involve the buyback of more than 10 per cent of the value of the company's shares in a 12-month period. The ASC must be notified of shares which are bought back and cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has some concerns about the share buyback provisions of this bill. Buybacks are still a controversial and fairly complicated area of the Corporations Law. It is not yet established that the new scheme will achieve its purpose. Experts have suggested that the taxation implications of the proposed share buyback rules need to be considered. Shareholders who live outside the jurisdiction may find it difficult to comply with the provisions. For these reasons, the coalition believes that any reform to this area of the Corporations Law should be further examined in detail by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an unusual legislative technique, the bill contains, in a schedule, a small business guide. The guide is written in what is known by lawyers as `plain English'. The guide contains basic information on company formation and obligations. The government has indicated in the explanatory memorandum that the guide is designed for people who operate small businesses, and its stated aim is to help them understand their rights and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill specifies that the guide will be amended by regulation to reflect changes in the regulations or in instruments issued by the ASC under the Corporations Law. The guide is certainly innovative and may assist those in small business. It has been greeted favourably by various bodies. However, the coalition is concerned about the inclusion of the guide as part of the Corporations Law. The process of amending the guide will be complicated. Although the guide may also be used to help the courts in interpreting the legislation, the coalition is of the view that its location within the legislation itself should be examined further by the parliamentary joint committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major changes proposed by the bill is to reduce the number of shareholders required to form a proprietary company from two to one and the number of directors from two to one. The business law section of the Law Council of Australia has recommended against allowing companies to be incorporated with only one director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change proposed by the bill is to reduce the regulatory burden on small companies by streamlining requirements for the establishment of and reporting by those companies. The removal of arduous provisions with which compliance is so time consuming is to be encouraged. However, the coalition is concerned about the removal of so many provisions upon which creditors and others place reliance. This is another aspect of the proposed reforms that must be referred to a committee for closer examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to replace the distinction between `exempt' and `non-exempt' proprietary companies with a distinction between `small' and `large' proprietary companies. The bill distinguishes a large proprietary company from a small one by its gross revenue, assets and number of employees. This quantitative test has raised concerns among experts in the accounting and legal professions with whom the coalition has consulted. It has been a criticism of the test that it is arbitrary and may result in an incorrect classification, resulting in inadequate protection for creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not make clear the status of companies which may hover around the level of small companies but reach large company status at the very end of the financial year. Some companies may genuinely fluctuate between the two categories during the year, and may, therefore, fall in or out of differing requirements. This is an aspect of the bill which needs to be examined further, in terms of the treatment of genuine and contrived cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms in the bill focus financial reporting obligations on public companies and large proprietary companies, and remove the obligation for proprietary companies to hold an annual general meeting. Small proprietary companies will generally not have to prepare annual financial statements, apply accounting standards or have them audited, unless required to do so by members holding five per cent of the shares or by the ASC. The new provisions will exempt small proprietary companies from the requirement to lodge key financial data with the ASC. Certain other amendments deal with the lodgment of accounts with the ASC, access to financial statements and the restriction of a shareholder's right to transfer shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business law section of the Law Council of Australia has expressed the concern that it is short-sighted and counterproductive to suggest to people in business that certain advantages are available only while their companies remain small, and that this is a notion which should be abandoned. The Law Council points out that the Corporations Law should provide a framework in which business can flourish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes a number of amendments to the law in relation to company registers. The bill provides for, among other things, uniform rules on the registers of members, option holders and debenture holders; access to company registers by computer; the elimination of requirements to keep a number of registers, such as those of directors, principal executive officers and secretaries; improved notification procedures in some areas; reduced access to certain information; and the abolition of company branch registers within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these reforms have received support, it is important that the public be able to access information conveniently and at reasonable cost. There is also cause for concern when company records, upon which so many groups and individuals place reliance, are eliminated. While simplification of such complex legislation is encouraged by the coalition, the coalition draws the government's attention to the fact that this bill is not purely a change in form. This simplification also changes many fundamental concepts of company law, the most important of those being the concept of a company with at least two directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of the bill also reduce reporting requirements for companies and access by the public to certain information about companies. Some of the bodies consulted by the coalition are concerned that this bill may lead to a lowering of corporate governance standards, resulting in a lack of confidence in Australian proprietary companies on the part of creditors, financial institutions and overseas companies. The Australian Institute of Company Directors has recommended that there at least be a continuing review to monitor the effectiveness of the simplification process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the bill. However, the coalition will be moving a second reading amendment, encouraging the government to give consideration to the detail of the simplification process. As the Attorney-General has foreshadowed, it is the coalition's wish that this bill be referred to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry and report. As the Attorney-General has indicated, he has, albeit reluctantly, agreed to that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have said enough to indicate the reasons why the coalition suggests that there should be a reference to the joint committee. Let me address separately some comments on the proposed second reading amendment. It is the intention to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not opposing the principles of this Bill, the House is of the opinion that, given the importance of simplification to the business community and the need for the process to proceed in an appropriate manner, that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities should be given a general reference to inquire into and report on the simplification process, following its anticipated consideration of this Bill".</PARA>
<PARA>I anticipate my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) will second that amendment. Let me just explain what prompts this. Simplification of the law is almost without argument a desirable objective. The simplification process, as is evident in this First Corporate Law Simplification Bill, inevitably involves change. Change as such involves the community in the area of corporations law and in a number of others great expense, great inconvenience and, in some cases, great delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain why. I have given this sort of explanation before in relation to similar debates. My father in the 1930s did a correspondence course to become an accountant. In that course he had to undertake a course in company law. He told me&mdash;and I have no reason to doubt his word&mdash;that for the purpose of doing that course in company law he learnt the then Companies Act of Western Australia based on an 1893 statute, I think, off by heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I graduated in law and commenced my articles of clerkship in a Perth firm in the mid-1960s, the senior partner, a very senior practitioner in the profession in Perth, had been in practice for some 30 years. He complained to me at the time the uniform company legislation came in based on the 1958 Victorian act&mdash;Western Australia came in in 1961&mdash;that he had to set aside a lot of learning that he had accumulated over a lifetime of practice and start again. It did not just involve learning new sections and section numbers; it involved picking up minor changes of wording that entirely changed the effect of the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in practice before coming into parliament I acquired background knowledge on the Corporations Law as it was then in relation to the uniform legislation of the early 1960s. In the early 1980s the Companies Code was introduced and I had the same experience that the senior partner in my firm had had in the early 1960s. But I had a second experience because when the Corporations Law came in in the early 1990s I had the same process all over again. Convenience of legal practitioners is not of great moment, but it has to be borne in mind&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is to practitioners, I accept, but the convenience of the public who are involved with the Corporations Law is of great moment. Members of the public who are involved with the Corporations Law are virtually all those people who are involved in business in any form whatever. Major companies have to establish routines and regimes that enable them to comply with the law as it is and they have to amend those regimes to cope with changes and amendments in the law as they occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suburban practitioners both in law and accounting who deal with companies on a daily basis&mdash;in fact, many other professions do so as well&mdash;have to have an up-to-date knowledge of what the rules require as they apply to the business that they deal with. When there is a major change, the corporations and the suburban practitioners have to start all over again. It involves resettling their forms, developing new processes, training staff and, in effect, taking a long while to get used to something that is different to what they had become accustomed to. That involves great inconvenience and great expense to the public, and the public pays for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern, which has prompted the moving of this amendment to the second reading motion, is that the simplification process, while very desirable in its own right, is not just a simplification process. It is a process that the Attorney-General introduced in 1993, but it is envisaged that it will go for many years. If the first simplification bill is an example of the sorts of changes that are likely to be proposed in each of the bills that are to come out of the task force, then we are looking at major reforms to the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions have to be asked: is the simplification process what we really want? Are we going about it in the right way? At an early stage of that process, it is appropriate that there should be an external examination of what the task force is doing with the advice of the advisory committee. This is not in any way to discredit the work of the task force, which is to be commended for what it has produced to date, but I think the task force must accept and must recognise that the changes that are being proposed will be dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Attorney-General on his agreement&mdash;although not on his reluctance&mdash;to refer the bill to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. I am equally concerned that that process not take too long. I am sure it will not. I have confidence that the task will be undertaken on a bipartisan basis by the members of the committee from both houses, with the objective of ensuring that the bill is as good a bill as can be got.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important bill. Most people in Australia accept that there is a need to simplify the Corporations Law. When the coalition received this bill, it consulted widely in the Australian community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would be aware, I am talking about the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill and the importance of simplification. As was previously indicated, a task force consisting of experts and professionals was established by the Attorney-General in 1993 to simplify the Corporations Law. A number of exposure drafts have been issued covering different areas of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, which is modelled on the first exposure draft, comprises seven schedules and addresses a number of matters, including the ability of Australian companies to buy back their own shares, the provisions relating to proprietary companies, the streamlining of the requirements for company registers and also, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Tangney, a small business guide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone accepts that the companies legislation in Australia is far too complex. John Farrar from the University of Melbourne has outlined three principles of modernisation of Corporations Law in developed countries. He says that our current legislation fails on three counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three counts are as follows. Firstly, we have the principle of incompatibility. As the complexity of a system increases, our ability to make precise and yet significant statements about its behaviour diminishes until a threshold is reached beyond which precision and significance become mutually exclusive characteristics: that is, this legislation should be of a drafting style which is capable of comprehension by its audience. The second count is the principle of user friendliness, and the third count is the presumption in favour of freedom of contract or freedom of transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone agrees that there is a problem. The Business Council of Australia in a recent report published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 23 November 1994 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporate governance legislation has become too complex and should be simplified to allow greater self-regulation.</PARA>
<PARA>The very prominent accountancy firm, Deloittes, has said that there is a major problem with tax laws.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Law in Australia contrasts in its simplification procedures very unfavourably with the law in other countries, including the United States of America. Unfortunately, what we have done so far is too little too late. We applaud what the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has done in so far as he has achieved some simplification. We are saying that not enough has been done. We certainly hope that this procedure will accelerate in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains a number of important changes. Whilst it is a simplification bill, it also alters a number of previously understood concepts of the Corporations Law. As part of its provisions the bill includes details permitting share buybacks. These provisions are contained in schedules 1 and 2. Although Australian companies have been able to buy back their own shares under section 205 of the Corporations Law for about five or six years, the current provisions are considered by professionals to be cumbersome and costly. </PARA>

However, share buybacks are still controversial and are still considered to be a fairly complicated area of the law. Professor Baxt and the AICD have suggested that the taxation implications also need to be considered. I commend those particular remarks to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Company Directors has indicated that it might be difficult to comply with provisions for shareholders who live outside the jurisdiction. Any reform should therefore be examined by a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also deals with the reform of proprietary companies in schedules 3 and 4. Schedule 3 inserts a small business guide. Schedule 4 makes a number of amendments which simplify certain processes and reduce the requirement for two directors. I wish to deal with these schedules separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the small business guide is an interesting idea and a novel one. I think most businesses would applaud the opportunity to have a guide in plain English. The guide, of course, includes basic information on company formation and obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has indicated that the guide is designed for people who operate small businesses. It aims to help them understand their rights and responsibilities. Given the draconian penalties included in the Corporations Law today for people who step off the straight and narrow, it is very important that they be as well advised as possible of the law so they can order their activities to ensure that they are within the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to another matter about which I am concerned and that is the increasing tendency of governments to bring in fuzzy law, or vague law, which does not spell out in black and white the obligations of the citizen. The strong argument in favour of black letter law is that citizens are able to look at the law and fully understand their obligations and the requirements made of them by the law, while fuzzy law often has to be interpreted some time in the future by a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been circumstances where people have done what they thought to be correct&mdash;they thought they were observing scrupulously the provisions of the law&mdash;but, sadly, a court has come along a number of years down the track and said that what the person thought was legal was in fact illegal. With the very severe penalties that the law now imposes, people in some cases have been penalised unfairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are talking about specifies that the small business guide will be amended by regulation to reflect changes in the regulations or instruments issued by the ASC under the law. This means that should any subordinate legislation be passed under the law, or should the ASC issue any directions or determinations, the small business guide may require amendment by regulation. While we say that this is innovative and interesting&mdash;and there has been some strong support for it from various bodies&mdash;it is questionable whether a guide should be included as part of the law. I dare say that, after we see how it is received and how effective it is, the Attorney-General could be coming back into the chamber at some time in the future to amend this section. It is one of those matters on which we will simply have to wait and see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also deals with reforms of proprietary companies in schedule 4. The major changes will be to reduce the number of shareholders required to form a proprietary company from two to one, and the number of directors from two to one. Australia will not be the only country to have that provision. I understand that Canada and New Zealand have provisions allowing one person to form a company with one director. These provisions also apply in the United Kingdom but only in relation to private companies. Other countries, such as France and Germany, allow sole traders to trade with limited liability but they are not companies as we understand them. This is one of the major changes made by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that this is a bill to simplify the law&mdash;it does to an extent&mdash;but in addition to that simplification it introduces some major changes to what we have always understood to be the fundamental tenets of Corporations Law. Referring to the reform of proprietary companies, the bill seeks to reduce the regulatory burden on small companies, according to the government, through the streamlining and establishment of reporting requirements. It replaces the distinction between exempt and non-exempt proprietary companies with a distinction between small and large proprietary companies. A large proprietary company is distinguished from a small one by its gross revenue assets and number of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill focuses financial reporting obligations on public companies and large proprietary companies, and removes the obligation for proprietary companies to hold an annual general meeting. Small proprietary companies will generally not have to prepare annual financial statements, apply accounting standards, or have them audited unless required to do so by members holding five per cent of the shares or by the ASC. Key financial data will also not be required to be lodged with the ASC. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 20 December 1994 contained an article written by Jason Clout. In that article, a senior manager at Ernst and Young, Mr Bryce Hardman, is reported to have expressed some concern about what the government was suggesting. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abolishing mandatory annual financial returns for small businesses has alarmed the accounting profession and could threaten the existence of some small firms, according to a senior manager at Ernst &amp; Young, Mr Bryce Hardman.</PARA>
<PARA>We really will have to see how these changes work in practice to find out whether the concerns of Mr Hardman are realised. Some people would say that accounting firms have a vested interest in ensuring that we have the kinds of audits and the kind of reporting we have had in the past. It is pretty clear that what the government is doing, while it might have majority support, does not necessarily have universal support throughout the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the removal of arduous provisions for which compliance is time consuming should be encouraged&mdash;and the coalition certainly backs this&mdash;the removal of so many provisions upon which reliance is placed does require further examination. I am pleased that this bill is therefore being sent off to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, as indicated by the Attorney-General. The lessening of the provision of information may run counter in principle to the concept that companies should keep shareholders better informed. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has commented that an accounting standard currently in practice called the reporting entity concept would be a better basis for differential regulation than the small or large distinction between companies. An arbitrary, quantitative test for the size of a company such as that proposed by the bill may result in incorrect classification and may not provide adequate protection for directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also deals with company registers and makes a number of amendments in relation to them. It is very important to appreciate, therefore, that this is a major bill; it is not just a minor bill changing certain wording. It is a bill which is a step in the right direction and we in the coalition certainly applaud what the government is doing to this end. But it is clear that what the government has done is not enough at this stage. It is a step in the right direction but there are problems with this bill. Consequently, I am pleased it is being sent off to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased that the honourable member for Tangney has moved the amendment which is currently before the House. I hope the government accepts this amendment in the bipartisan sense in which it is offered because an orderly and readable Corporations Law is vital for an effective business sector and a properly run economy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As shadow spokesperson for small business, I welcome the opportunity today to speak on the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1994. I understand this bill is the first in a series of bills to simplify the rules which regulate corporations and to express the Corporations Law in plain English. It is a process that is very much supported by the coalition and the business community, and it is very much an overdue initiative on the government's behalf to reduce the burden of compliance and red tape on the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gone are the days when the business community, in particular the small business sector, should be expected to tolerate and wade through legal verbosity that has been the traditional style of our legal and corporate history. The overriding aim of the corporate law simplification project is to rewrite Australia's corporate law into a user-friendly form that is readily accessible and understandable by individuals who have a need to refer to it. However, rewriting the Corporations Law is a time consuming and very complex process that requires extensive consultation between government and industry organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very pleasing to note that in general the business community is supportive of the structure of the review process and, as would have been expected, has in good faith committed substantial resources to ensure that the process of consultation and communication enhances the delivery of worthwhile outcomes. The small business community has demonstrated repeatedly its willingness to commit valuable management resources, time and money, to assist the government to reform issues of importance, such as this issue, to its sector. The federal government has no excuse for its lack of commitment to the pace of reform, given that commitment by the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be expected in such a complex review that there will be issues of ongoing concern to business that must be addressed during the passage of this bill through the parliament. The bill addresses three areas of the Corporations Law, and it is good to note that for a change small business aspects of the reform process take precedence and are amongst the first to be considered. So major consideration has been given to the small business sector in the revision of this Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not very often that issues of importance to small business are afforded such a high priority by the government. I am particularly pleased that this has occurred with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major changes proposed is to introduce a plain English small business guide that will form part of the Corporations Law. While the decision to include this guide in the Corporations Law has drawn some criticism, it is an important innovation that will enhance the capacity of small business proprietors to understand the complexities of Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to confine my comments to those aspects of the bill that impact on small business. In that regard, the amendments that relate to proprietary companies are of particular importance. I have discussed these amendments at length with members of the accountancy profession and other business people who have raised a number of valid concerns with the presentation of this section of the bill. These individuals are expert in the field. They are at the leading or the cutting edge of understanding and implementing the Corporations Law. It is their opinion that I value most, as they will be responsible for ensuring that Australia's 757,000 small business proprietors are able to access and benefit from the changes that will flow from these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that have been presented in this bill acknowledge the complexity and the evolving structure of the small business environment. There are a number of major changes to flow from the reform of proprietary companies that are significant to small business. The bill will, for example, reduce the number of shareholders required to form a proprietary company from two to one and the number of directors from two to one. This will cancel out the charade that we have seen for so long in the corporate world where a sole proprietor who wants to convert to a proprietary limited company has to run around and find somebody who may have no interest or concern about the operation of the business to fulfil the requirement of the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular amendment, therefore, is of great significance to small business and it does recognise the changing environment for small business operators. It also addresses a significant barrier to many people who operate as sole traders but who have been unable to establish an appropriate business structure</PARA>
<PARA>without the support of silent directors. As I say, it does away with that charade and it is an important issue that has been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women in small business will also have their independence enhanced by this particular change. Nearly 30 per cent of small businesses in Australia are owned by women. Women tend to head up organisations that are, what I would call, in the micro-business area&mdash;that is, under four or five employees. This will be of particular significance to those women in Australia participating in the small business sector. They will not have to go around looking for directors who may have no relevance to their business at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue this bill will address is the reduction of the regulatory burden on small companies, as the bill proposes streamlining the establishment and reporting requirements. This is yet to be fully quantified but is of paramount importance to the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major issues of concern to all small businesses is the proliferation of government red tape and compliance costs. Along with taxation reform, this has been noted by many of the business organisations throughout Australia and business people individually as one of the high priority areas for business efficiency in Australia today. This bill addresses that concern of proliferation of government red tape and compliance costs in the operation of a business and, along with tax, is one of the key issues for small business today. If this bill actually contributes to a meaningful reduction in red tape and compliance costs for small business, that in itself will be a major achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this government will not be simply allowed to sit back and hope that all of this will work. The small business sector has become a voice to be reckoned with. As I said, there are 757,000 small businesses in Australia today employing somewhere in the region of 2 1/2 million Australians. They will be monitoring very closely the implementation of these reforms to ensure that the rhetoric of the bill is actually matched by market reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of small business, the bill will also replace the distinction between exempt and non-exempt proprietary companies with a distinction between small and large proprietary companies. This is one of the most contentious aspects, though, of the bill and in my opinion requires considerably more work before it is introduced. It warrants a much closer inspection to ensure that the arbitrary quantitative test for the size of a company does not result in the incorrect classification of a company or lead to an unacceptable level of protection for creditors. The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) who spoke before me touched on this particular aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all of us in Australia today would not want to see a repeat of the 1980s when a group of cowboys in the business community carried on business in such a way as to discredit business generally in this country. We want to make sure, certainly in relation to the simplification, that the safeguards remain in place for those of the public who wish to invest in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the arbitrary quantitative test has some problems because its application relies on a company matching two of three of the following: firstly, the number of employees; secondly, the gross revenue; and, thirdly, the gross assets. Companies must comply with two of three of those under the arbitrary quantitative test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals that relate to the distinction between small and large proprietary companies have drawn criticism from two of Australia's prominent accounting organisations, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. In particular the concerns of these organisations relate to the small company tests and to the basis for establishing the appropriate classification of an entity. It is the view of these organisations that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the criteria for identifying a company as a "small company" are said to be directed to identifying those companies that because of their financial characteristics  should be classified as non-reporting entities, they do not address the impact of separation of economic interest from management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure to include a maximum number of members for a company to qualify as a "small company" will result in many reporting entities being excused from the accountability obligations that they should meet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They further went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accountancy bodies reaffirm their concern that the use of arbitrary quantitative tests will inevitably result in different classifications of companies to the ones that would occur if the more sophisticated reporting entity concept were applied. A difficulty in using arbitrary tests is that cases can be made for including many tests.</PARA>
<PARA>A good case in point is that if we were concerned about public or consumer interest then we might want to apply a liabilities test as well. Extending this point further, it must be noted that in respect of small businesses the major shareholders, which in most instances are also the managers of the businesses, are in the best position to identify the most appropriate information requirements to satisfy their needs and the needs of their creditors and bankers. Arbitrary tests will unfortunately place obligations on many companies that are simply outside the circumstances of either their shareholders or creditors, and will lead to unnecessary expense in relation to information, compliance and audit structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday when speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) I mentioned that many of our colleagues on the other side have had no business experience and simply fail to understand the implications of some of these measures on the small business community today, and this is a case in point. I wonder whether anybody on the other side has actually taken the time to consider the implications of a small company that does not meet the arbitrary quantitative criteria and which then has to go through the process of doing an audit and a report in the BHP-glossy style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether anyone opposite has ever gone to the trouble of checking out the cost of that to the average small company, and I know that no-one opposite has done any checking to find out how many small companies in Australia may in fact be caught up in that provision, but the cost is somewhere in the region of $30,000. That would be an annual cost for a full audit of a small company, and that would wipe out many small Australian companies. I would suggest that this one part of the bill is an area on which there needs to be a great deal more consultation. We need a great deal more information before we proceed to pass this as law through this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record keeping and compliance requirements and costs would be really onerous and high under those circumstances and without any necessity, because if there is only one director or owner shareholder of that company the only people interested in that sort of information would be the banks, as I said before, which may be lending money for the company to operate, and other creditors and suppliers of the company. So it would seem a terrible waste of resources to insist that these companies, because they do not meet the arbitrary quantitative measure, be forced to go through this audit report and the huge costs associated with that. We ought to be trying to ensure the money that Australian companies might be putting into that style of report be used in getting expert financial advice and in developing other mechanisms to improve the way in which they do business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are obviously many complications that can and will arise in this area that have the potential to impose significant and unnecessary burdens on the small business community. Unnecessary and expensive audit requirements are perhaps the most important issue of concern, along with the public issue of ensuring that, in those appropriate cases, the public has the kind of information it needs. Arbitrary tests in the case of the audit reports will leave no capacity for shareholders of a company to determine its information requirements and establish an appropriate corporate entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern that arbitrary tests to determine the corporate status of an enterprise would overlook a number of possibilities for deceptive and fraudulent conduct. It is an unfortunate fact of life that there are unscrupulous individuals only too willing to take advantage of inexperienced, unwary and unsuspecting investors. It would be grossly irresponsible if this parliament passed legislation that compromised the protection of investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that, under some circumstances, arbitrary testing could result in some companies which should be presenting comprehensive financial reports to shareholders not being required to do so. Alternatively, there could be an obligation for many companies which may be classified as large having to prepare extensive audit and compliance reports that are not required by shareholders. The arbitrary quantitative test could impose real penalties on certain companies. We have not been able to establish the extent of the impact of that. So no research has been done to find out how many companies would get caught up in that measure, as I said before. Other aspects of the arbitrary testing regime that have been raised as warranting further consideration relate to the appointment of auditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested that, in some instances, the changed status of a company during the reporting period could lead to the necessity to retrospectively appoint an auditor. It is of concern to the accounting profession that a retrospective appointment of an auditor will ordinarily limit the credibility that can be given to the financial report through the audit process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is important to simplify and create a corporate law that is conducive to today's business environment, it will not enhance investors' confidence if information provided by companies is qualified due to doubts surrounding the audit process. It is paramount that the audit process be independent, with regulations that enhance investor confidence and therefore business growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a major concern if this bill were to be passed into law in a manner that raised doubt or ambiguity for small business managers and investors, or imposed any unnecessary compliance costs on small business. The reason why small business wants tax reform and regulation reform is to help it to become more efficient and to save money. So if this bill serves to simplify the Corporations Law but then imposes additional high costs on business the whole purpose of the exercise is defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technological advances, outsourcing of non-core business activities and the development of home based businesses have influenced the development of niche small businesses and, therefore, a different style of business structure in Australia today. There is now a proliferation of `micro' small businesses around Australia, as individuals and companies respond to changing work and business practices. It is these businesses about which we have great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consideration of the detail of this bill has identified many issues which require further elaboration. Because of these wide-ranging concerns, the coalition recommends that further consideration be given to the proposals contained in this bill. The scrutiny and benefit to be obtained by referring the bill to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities will provide this opportunity. It will enable this parliament to present to the business community, investors and the public at large changes to the Corporations Law that will enhance their confidence in investment in Australian companies. These changes will also simplify the process for the business community and make it more cost effective. I support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It will place additional emphasis on the importance of the corporate law simplification process to small business. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I inform the House that, since the opening of the new parallel runway at KSA, the practice has been for the east-west runway to be used only when cross-winds of 25 knots do not allow parallel operations on the north-south path. That is absolutely consistent with international practice, which accepts that parallel runway operations are safer than cross-runway operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition knows full well, this was the basis of a 1989 decision to construct the second north-south runway as well as being fundamental to the environmental approval process in 1991. That environmental approval stated that, with the opening of the new parallel runway and limited use of the east-west runway, fewer people would be seriously and moderately affected by noise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report of the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority acknowledges that very point. The estimates now provided by the Civil Aviation Authority of people moderately and seriously affected by noise under the operations of the airport between 4 December last and 14 January 1995&mdash;that is, the first survey period of the new arrangements&mdash;confirm that this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey shows that the number of people seriously and moderately affected by noise over this period was 79,860 compared with 138,820 under the cross-runway operations in place before 4 November last year. The difference is some 50,000 people. That said, I want all honourable members to know that they will never hear me downplaying the great burden faced by those under the north-south access the way the Leader of the Opposition downplayed that burden in his interviews in 1988 and 1989 and which he repeated on numerous occasions right through until 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment to these people who are feeling the burden is one that we are absolutely and utterly committed to pursuing. We are doing so through the narrowing of the flight paths and their enforcement; through the noise amelioration program that is being administered by the Department of Administrative Services; by strict enforcement of the curfew; by maximising take-offs over Botany Bay; and through the fast-tracking of Badgerys Creek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, recently we have had the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;the once fierce supporter of the north-south parallel runway&mdash;making his own contribution to the noise debate. His plan is to reopen the east-west runway. That is the commitment he gave to mayors only last week&mdash;never mind that by doing so we see an action contrary to the safety advice of the CAA and contrary to the advice independently given by Dr Bob Ratner, one of the world's leading safety experts.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increased operational complexities, hence safety concerns, and would not be particularly useful in increasing movement rates.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the advice of Mr Ratner. If the Leader of the Opposition is nevertheless determined to reopen the east-west runway, he owes the people of Sydney some very serious answers. The people of Sydney need to know whether his plan is, first, to have three runways operating simultaneously for all aircraft types and to go back to simultaneous take-offs and landings&mdash;the infamous simops&mdash;and so adopt a less safe, more inefficient and stressful operation for controllers whilst maximising the number of people experiencing noise. There will be an additional 50,000 people under the noise contour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Leader of the Opposition proposing, secondly, the industry's favoured option of increasing capacity at Kingsford-Smith Airport by allowing east-west take-offs and landings by small planes that stop short of the north-south runway. If so, not only is he proposing a less safe option but also he will be freeing up the north-south path for more jets by eliminating light aircraft from the north-south access. That will absolutely guarantee more noise for those people who are already suffering the burden on the northern access. Thirdly, is the Leader of the Opposition proposing that we write off $250 million, not use the new runway, and accept chronic capacity problems? They are the questions that the Leader of the Opposition should answer in the interests of everyone in Sydney.</PARA>

He does so within days of his parliamentary colleagues in Western Australia raising fuel taxes in that state by 70 per cent. Talk about an unbelievable piece of hypocrisy! But it is not just in Western Australia, because only last year we had the spectre of what happened in New South Wales when we untied the road funds and allowed the states the ability to spend all the money paid from excise to the states on roads at their discretion. What was the first thing that the New South Wales Liberals did? They stole half the money and put it into consolidated revenue. Yet you come in here and challenge our bona fides and our approach to fuel taxation. We will continue to be utterly responsible in our approach in this budget, as in all previous budgets.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question. Last week I did write to the committee chair, the honourable member for Hunter, requesting that his committee inquire into a number of issues concerning children under the age of 15 who do not attend school, either because they are truant or because they are excluded. I am disappointed that the New South Wales Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has chosen to argue that the inquiry is not necessary on the basis that truancy in her state is declining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that the government's concern over these matters is not about numbers but about individuals, although the figures that I have seen on truancy suggest that the New South Wales minister was not correct when she said that secondary school absences in her state were static. In the western Sydney region, part of which is represented by the honourable member for Chifley, as many as 1,300 children a day are absent without reason&mdash;the equivalent of one large high school. The percentages in some areas appear to have increased between 1988 and 1993. I am concerned, but not primarily with children who wag school for a day.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do appreciate the comments of the Queensland minister, who hopes for some solid recommendations from the inquiry. I have no particular interest in comparing figures on truancy state by state. Definitions vary and comparing figures is not always necessarily helpful. But I am interested in finding out which policies work best to keep children in school and off the streets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Policies of exclusion vary from state to state. In the ACT, for example, the Liberal Party is proposing that school fees set by the local school council should be mandatory. This immediately raises the question: what happens to the children whose parents cannot afford to pay? Are they, for example, to be excluded from school? That is a political question, but there is a deeper question: where would those children go and what support would be available to them? Where do children excluded from school, either voluntarily or by compulsion, go now? Those are questions which I hope the committee will be able to answer. Children of 13 or 14 years of age are fragile human beings, both physically and emotionally. What happens to them if they are outside the school system is an important question. Do they inevitably get involved in petty crime and with the juvenile justice system, and what support do they get?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Children in this country have a right to an education. More than that, the school provides a social structure for the child and an environment where adults have a duty to look after the child. I know that all members appreciate the work that the standing committee did on violence in schools, resulting in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sticks and stones</EMPHASIS> report, but I think that all members would agree that even the most violent schoolyard is safer than the streets of St Kilda or Kings Cross. The New South Wales minister's defensive reaction is disappointing because she misses that essential point.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind members that we have a fair bit to teach the Pacific nations in this regard. Once upon a time, we had a hell of a tuna fishery in this country. In 1961 we fished 81,000 tonnes of southern bluefin tuna. The figure in 1961 was a peak figure; it has been going down every year since then. Last year we fished 11,750 tonnes. In other words, we had a super fishery and we blew it, just as so many countries have blown their fishery resources in the past. The Newfoundland cod fishery is now officially extinct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the last great fisheries in the world. Last year something like $US1 1/2 billion worth of tuna was taken out of the Pacific. Out of that, the Pacific countries&mdash;the owners of that resource&mdash;got about $45 million. In other words, they got much less than five per cent of the value of that resource.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found the last part of the question terribly obscure. If he would like to rephrase the question about the monorail, I would be more than happy to answer it. I turn to the more serious federal responsibility of the development of Badgerys Creek airport. I am pleased to inform both the honourable member and the House of the great benefit of Badgerys Creek airport from an environmental point of view. The profile of noise revealed in the environmental impact statement for the Badgerys Creek airport shows that less than two per cent of the number of people who reside in the surrounds of KSA reside in the surrounds of Badgerys Creek. That is the reason that Badgerys Creek was put forward in the first instance as a curfew-free airport, one that could operate 24 hours a day and provide an alternative to KSA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a local member living near Kingsford-Smith Airport, my greatest fear is that, without the development of Badgerys Creek as an alternative to provide curfew-free access so that Sydney has an airport that can operate 24-hours a day, it is inevitable that one day a conservative government will allow the curfew to be lifted at Kingsford-Smith. That would have an impact at least 50 times greater than the impact of curfew-free operations at Badgerys Creek.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the very outset, let us be abundantly clear that this is not an environmental levy; this is an energy tax based upon carbon dioxide emissions. It is not an environmental levy. If it were an environmental levy, then the money it raised would be directed towards environmental projects or programs. Instead, the government has already foreshadowed that, at the rate of $1.25 per tonne of emitted carbon dioxide, half of the $320-odd million raised would go to offsetting environmental expenditure and the other half into consolidated revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an environmental levy. This is purely a new tax that will push up the price of electricity and petrol and will cascade right through the economy and through every aspect of household budgets. We are not going to let the government get away with this pretence, this falsehood, this outright act of deceit of calling it an environmental levy. It is anything but. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First off, it is a tax on business inputs. It is a tax on investment and employment, consequentially. It is an export tax. It is a tax on all households. So there is the trifecta: it is a tax on business inputs, it is a tax on exports and it is a tax on all consumers and motorists. It is pretty rare to be able to encapsulate all those regressive elements in the one package. But the government is managing to do it. On top of all of that, it is a very complex tax to administer and a very costly tax to collect. Nobody has a good word for this tax except the extremist greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition accepts the need to address the issue of the greenhouse effect. Science is now generally in agreement that the Earth's temperature is warming, but there are diverse opinions and research as to the rate and consequences. It is very sensible to take precautionary measures now, but we should not rush into a problem that is still so ill defined at a cost to the national interest. It requires cool and steady heads to address this issue of the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be put into perspective. Australia contributes only 1 1/2 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions&mdash;some 420 million tonnes. It is the major contributor to the greenhouse effect. Methane, as honourable members would know, is the next most significant of the greenhouse gases. We contribute 1.2 per cent of the world's total, or just over six million tonnes. Whilst the green movement argues that we are heavy contributors to the greenhouse effect on a per capita basis, in global terms our contribution is almost negligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a global problem and the solution lies in an equitable sharing of the burden between all countries. Australia has a great deal to lose from unilaterally restricting greenhouse gas emissions. Nobody would unilaterally disarm, even at the height of the Cold War, and we should not engage in the trade equivalent of unilateral disarmament whereby we impose a greenhouse gas restriction tax on ourselves when no-one else in the world does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who else is going to impose a carbon dioxide tax, let alone dress it up as a greenhouse levy? There are only five OECD countries that have introduced a carbon or energy tax: Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark and Finland. In all of those taxes, exemptions upon exemptions are built in. They are not fossil fuel or energy intensive countries. Norway, for instance, is not going to tax its gas production. The United States and the European Community are resisting the move towards energy taxes which we are rushing headlong into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's proposal for an energy tax of $1.25 per tonne of carbon dioxide would push up the price of commodities such as petrol, coal, electricity and aluminium. At a rate of $1.25 per tonne of carbon dioxide, the tax has been estimated by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research to yield greenhouse gas savings of only three per cent off the government's target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Yet the tax would have a very significant effect on consumers and industry. For example, the Business Council of Australia has estimated that the tax would add 20 per cent to the cost of brown coal and 10 per cent to the cost of black coal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Electricity prices will rise for consumers. The tax on the petroleum industry would push up petrol prices. It is quite fascinating that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe)&mdash;quite separate from the energy tax floating throughout the government ranks&mdash;is arguing for a five per cent increase on fuel excise, which translates to 1.5c per litre. The Deputy Prime Minister is arguing for an increase in the fuel excise in addition to the carbon tax. The combined effect of the two will mean an increase of several cents to all motorists.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) says, he is the Deputy Prime Minister. His portfolio includes regional development. People living in rural areas, with a very heavy reliance on transport&mdash;farmers included&mdash;would find that their input costs and the costs at the grocery store would increase significantly. As the honourable member for Bendigo knows, those regional areas that have a heavy dependence on energy intensive industry&mdash;and I refer to the La Trobe Valley in Victoria, Gladstone in Queensland, Wollongong and Port Kembla in New South Wales, and the Iron Triangle in South Australia&mdash;would be very hard hit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effect would the government's carbon tax-energy tax have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions? We already know from the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research that it would have a minimal effect. Even people within the government's own ranks are prepared to speak out. The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), who is well known to members of the government as a particularly competent and popular minister, said on 13 December last year at a doorstop interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . don't say a carbon tax would reduce greenhouse because it would have to be at such a level that Australian industry would not be competitive.</PARA>
<PARA>Even Phillip Toyne, who is now a deputy secretary in the department of the environment, has poured cold water on expectations that the tax would have any effect on greenhouse. Mr Toyne is reported as saying that the carbon tax at present under consideration by the government `would, in isolation, produce only a modest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions'. That is from the de facto minister for the environment, fresh from his triumph in the woodchipping issue. If the Phillip Toynes of the world are telling us that the government's new tax will not reduce greenhouse emissions by any measurable or significant amount, there is no point in having it. Why introduce a tax which has such disastrous consequences for industry and for ordinary Australians for no real effect?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal that the government could have been doing over the last few years to minimise Australia's greenhouse gas emissions without reverting to new taxes. Industry at large has been organised for some time now and has been pushing the government to adopt no-regrets measures. Industry, of course, wants to purchase the most energy efficient plant, motors, drives and equipment because it makes plain business sense. Industry would save money on electricity costs and contribute to reduced emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government has never provided a lead. In May 1993 the Auditor-General roundly criticised the government and said that it had not even implemented its own energy saving targets or programs. That was followed up one year later by a House of Representatives committee which found that the government had done nothing in relation to greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is very good at talking about problems, particularly environment problems, but it is hopeless at ever doing anything concrete and lasting about them, whereas industry has. A detailed plan has been issued for some time now by the Australian black coal industry highlighting measures, including improved energy efficiency, research and development, and the reform of government regulation. The industry has identified measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions from New South Wales collieries by over 50 per cent by burning coal seam methane and at the same time generating over 100 megawatts of electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electricity industry has also pledged to work with other industries on greenhouse gas emissions and has provided a comprehensive inventory of actions under way, such as demand management, improved energy efficiency, research into renewable energy and more efficient supply, to name some of the key aspects of its efforts. At Mount Isa, the mines have already met the international target of reducing 1988 carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. This has been achieved by electricity use improvements and changes to mine operation procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other examples include mining companies using natural gas in remote operations and mining projects being planned to optimise layout and operation. So cooperative agreements between industry and government, and which industry wants finalised, are already being negotiated so that many other similar measures will be carried out in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government is not doing anything because of short-term pressures. It is prepared to compromise, even sacrifice, long-term growth for short-term pressures&mdash;the pressures coming from the extremists within the green movement. There is a great temptation for the government to try to appease some of those green groups, particularly after the woodchipping debacle that the government brought on itself by not following the national forest policy statement and not keeping to the agreed arrangements. We have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) accusing the Wilderness Society of Goebbels-like propaganda&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes; of all the people who are used to deceiving and distorting messages to the Australian people, the Prime Minister can talk. But that is what happens, as the shadow minister for the environment, the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), has said many times, when you lie to the environment movement groups. You must tell them where you stand, you must always adopt a scientific and factually based position&mdash;as we do on the timber industry and other environmental issues. If you lie to the environmental groups, you raise their expectations, which can never be met, even by an opportunist, cynical government like this, and they will turn on you. Trading invective for inventive by the Prime Minister is not going to solve the greenhouse problem one iota.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next problem for Australia will be at the meeting in Berlin in March for the international convention on climate change because the government is ill prepared for that. Earlier this year, Australia chaired a meeting for the Basel convention on the transboundary movement of hazardous waste, which meeting agreed to ban certain exports of hazardous wastes. The final position taken at that conference was opposite to Australia's initial position prior to the conference. This totally unexpected outcome has the potential to affect Australia's trade competitiveness with other countries. There is a real danger that at Berlin in March Australia will agree to schedules for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions which will severely damage our trade competitiveness compared with other countries, the economies of which derive so much less benefit from fossil fuels and mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, domestically and internationally, is hopelessly prepared to tackle this problem of greenhouse gas emissions. It has reverted to kind and simply introduced a new tax. It has not built up any coalition of interests between similar minded countries. Australia's trade competitiveness will suffer and, more directly, people in Australia will pay higher taxes because of the government's wilful neglect of a longstanding issue and its incompetent reaction at the very last moment. How very typical of this government's administration. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very wide-ranging debate and the question I was raising is: who is running the opposition? It is clear that Andrew Robb is running its tactics in this House and that people like Ron Walker are running the tax policy of the Liberal Party. When the Liberal Party and the National Party talk about designing a tax policy, they do not design it for ordinary Australians, for wage and salary earners; they design it for people like Ron Walker. They design policies like Fightback. Those people are the ones who thrust their agenda upon the Liberal and National parties in this House. They are the ones who design the unfair tax policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for the opposition to come into this House and to move the type of matter of public importance that it has simply proves its unbelievable hypocrisy when it comes to the question of taxes. If taxes were at the same level&mdash;if the same rates applied&mdash;now as they were when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer, every man, woman and child in this country would be paying an extra $550 a year.

Discussion of an environmental levy or a carbon tax is not an item that has been put on the agenda by the Treasury or by this government in an attempt to somehow soften up the electorate. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has made it very clear already in this House that this matter will be considered in the context of the government's responsibilities to reduce greenhouse emissions.

The Treasurer and other senior ministers have made it abundantly clear: this matter will be cleared up well before the budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is really about the approach of the Labor Party on this side and the Liberal and National parties on the other to taxation. There have been three distinct approaches to taxation that have been evident on that side of the House. The first approach was one that was presided over by successive Liberal Treasurers, culminating in the stewardship of the member for Bennelong, when you could drive a Mercedes and trucks right through the loopholes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It got to the stage in the late 1980s that tax was optional for the rich in this community. That is what you presided over. You presided over a situation in which by the late 1970s to the early 1980s tax was optional. The only people that paid tax in this community were wage and salary earners. That was your first approach to taxation. The second part of that approach to taxation was the famous fistful of dollars in 1977, when the member for Bennelong went to the election promising massive tax cuts, and came back one year later and took them all back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second stage of your approach to taxation occurred when the Leader of the Opposition was last the Leader of the Opposition in the lead up to the 1987 election, when he made what was called a counting error&mdash;an error of around $2 billion in your revenue estimates. We are all absolutely familiar with the third stage of your tax policy, the GST&mdash;a $23 billion slug on the Australian community, which was going to make 60 per cent of self-employed people worse off and 70 per cent of wage and salary earners worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one common theme that links together those three approaches to taxation: that is, your belief that the less you earn the more you should pay, and the more you earn the less you should pay. That is the theme that ran through your three approaches to taxation, both in government and in opposition. That is fundamental to the fact that you will remain in opposition forever, because you do not have a credible approach to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do you not just come clean and admit that, really, what you have got lurking in your tax cupboard is another big GST? If you will not come clean on where you are going to cut public expenditure, we can only be left with one conclusion: that you are going down that road again. Your finance spokesman recently said that he thought that the BCA list of cuts was a pretty good idea. So there is one member of your frontbench who is advocating $5 billion worth of cuts. What would $5 billion worth of cuts be? It would be the equivalent of knocking off family allowance in addition to family payment. Or are you heading back to the GST days when you were talking about cuts of the order of $10 billion? Are you talking about knocking off age pensions? What are your parameters for a responsible budget? In which direction are you going?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the only party in this country that has brought respectability to the tax system, that has engaged in real tax reform is the Labor Party. In 1983, when we inherited the mess that John Howard, the member for Bennelong, had presided over, we had to set about putting some fairness into the taxation system. We had to set about taxing fringe benefits. We had to set about bringing in a capital gains tax. We had to set about bringing some integrity into the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the next important stage of this debate. When we are talking about tax in this House, it is really a question of fairness and who pays. That is why it is legitimate to ask: who is making and running the policy on the opposite side of the House? It is abundantly clear from this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 31 January 1995 that the Liberal Party is not being run by the parliamentary wing, it is being run by the Treasurer of the Liberal Party, Ron Walker. It is clear from this memo that it is also being run by Andrew Robb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have to ask yourselves: what sort of tax policy do the Ron Walkers of this world want for this country? I think we all know what that tax policy is. It is a big, large GST. It is a $23 billion slug on ordinary Australians. It is a slug which would make most working people worse off. It is a slug which would redistribute income from the poor to the rich, from the middle income to the high income. That is the dynamic that governs taxation policy in your party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at the frontbench, who are now being directed in their daily tactics by Andrew Robb and Ron Walker, you can see why that is the case, because the loss of the leadership by the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and the loss of the leadership by the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) before him, had one common aspect&mdash;that is, the Melbourne Club had decided that both had to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is the prime representative of the Melbourne Club in this House? Who is the prime player for the Melbourne Club on the front bench of the opposition? Of course, we all know who it is. It is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). Was it not a coincidence that the member for Higgins happened to be present at this dinner on 15 December when it was decided that the member for Mayo had to leave the leadership? He took the instructions from Ron Walker, came back and got together with what has got to be the most right wing collection of frontbenchers ever seen in the history of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He got together with the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), the member for Flinders and the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan)&mdash;all of whom have been absolute defenders of a flat rate of taxation all their lives. Right through the last election campaign, they enthusiastically tramped up and down this country advocating a GST&mdash;propagandising for a GST. The member for Flinders was the prime exponent of a GST, but he was joined by the member for Higgins and many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are dancing to the tune of a small clique of business people based in the Melbourne Club who are now running the Liberal Party. We are not dealing now with the party of Sir Robert Menzies. The Liberal Party was formed to get away from shadowy financial influences in Sydney and Melbourne. It was supposed to be a party that was independent of those influences. But what we find now is that the policy agenda, the leadership agenda, of those opposite is being directed by those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House are confident that we will bring down a responsible budget which will ensure that growth is even and sustainable. We can do it, despite the fact that you will be instructed day in and day out to come in here and scaremonger. What the Australian people understand and want is some honesty, integrity and openness. What they will get from us is a budget that will provide long-term sustainable economic recovery. That is what we will deliver. Our policies will not be developed in the Melbourne Club. Our policies will not be developed at the Chateau hotel, where the decision to change your leadership was made at the end of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people drawing up the tax policy for those opposite were described by the member for Wentworth as not being representative of the needs of average Australians. That is what the member for Wentworth said about the people who are responsible for drawing up your economic policy&mdash;that they are not representative of the needs of average Australians. So we wait with interest to see how you are going to fudge the tax policy for the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know from past practice that you will not come clean and specify where the spending cuts will come from. We certainly know that you will not come clean about your political belief in a GST. We know that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's disarray on this matter is exemplified by the fact that it has produced a backbencher to defend its new tax grab. What a remarkable speech by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan); he did not address one iota of the issue. The government's intent on this matter was made quite clear on 18 January 1995 in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. A confidential cabinet document referred to in the article indicated the long-term intent of the government. The article was headlined `Revealed: Green tax shock'. It outlined a $13 billion grab, a $20 a tonne carbon tax and a new 10c a litre fuel levy. That is what the government is on about. The cabinet submission clearly detailed what the government had in mind in the longer term. It wanted the money to be dressed up in green environmental clothes. Another article in the same newspaper, on the same day, written by Steve Burrell, was headlined `Canberra hit by outbreak of economic madness'. On the one hand, yet again, we have the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, and, on the other hand, we have the economic ministers&mdash;the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), Senator Cook and Senator McMullan&mdash;arguing a more sensible case, which the shadow minister, the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), put forward, in terms of the impost on business that this new tax would create.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment minister is now trying to placate the green movement because this is starting to become an issue. We read in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that Senator Faulkner is now working on a new protocol for consultation between the government and green groups which will almost certainly lead to more selective contacts. So this new tax is being promoted by Senator Faulkner because he is trying to placate the green movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a debacle last week, which the member for Gippsland referred to, when we again had Senator Faulkner pitted against the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). Minister Beddall put forward quite reasonable arguments in terms of the woodchip licences which he issued and which were agreed to under the national forest policy statement. In some states 15 years of security of tenure had been given for these logging contracts in certain coupes. Again, we have the government being run by the environmental movement because they want their arguments put forward. I refer to another newspaper article headlined `Carbon tax critics "hysterical", say greens'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Conservation Foundation spokesman, Mr Peter Kinrade, said the attacks by business groups and several State governments were "hysterical and misinformed", and that reaction to the issue was "grossly out of proportion to the nature and impact of the levies being proposed".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Carbon taxes are now firmly on the international agenda," Mr Kinrade said. </PARA>
<PARA>The situation is that the government wishes to impose a new tax, wrapped up in environmental clothes. As the member for Lilley quite clearly said, the government wishes to have its environmental credentials enhanced when it goes to Berlin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members would remember former minister Ros Kelly, of whiteboard fame; the minister who signed the cover of the document but did not read the contents. Remember her? She is no longer with us but she attended the Rio convention and undertook to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. Those greenhouse gas projections will never be met by Australia. The government admitted only yesterday that this would not occur. Australian emissions will rise 14 per cent more than we had projected. It is worth noting, as the shadow minister indicated in his speech, that Australia produces only one to two per cent of world greenhouse gas emissions. Senator Faulkner is going to Berlin, so he is putting up the argument that the carbon tax will enhance the government's green credentials. But will the government go to the Berlin conference and say that it is thinking about draining Lake Pedder, which provides sustainable, clean energy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate to the member for Lilley, having regard to his tirade about the GST, that we have abandoned that policy. Mr Keith Orchison, the executive director of the Electricity Supply Association, in an ABC radio interview, referred to `the new GST, the greenhouse surcharge tax'. That was his view. So much for the government's GST&mdash;that is exactly what the government proposes. It will be small at first, but it will gradually be increased until it is a big tax grab. An impost of $1.25 a tonne raises about $320 million in the first instance&mdash;all very nice; not very much tax&mdash;putting 10 per cent on the cost of black coal and 20 per cent on the cost of brown coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember the fringe benefits tax. In 1986-87 it was a small tax of $535 million&mdash;not too much; nobody worried. Now, in 1994-95, the fringe benefits tax is $3.2 billion. So a small tax has become a big tax. Let us look at the petroleum excise tax. In the beginning it raised $2 billion. It is now raising $9.7 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we were told by Prime Minister Hawke, `There'll be no capital gains tax.' An amount of $25 million was raised in the first year. In 1992-93, $365 million was raised. It is not even put in the budget papers now; they hide it. They do not even tell us the figure. So much for these small taxes. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, headlined `Report points to high costs of carbon tax', contains the caption `Senator Faulkner: leading campaign'. The article refers to a report by ACIL which outlines the very good performance by the aluminium industry in Australia. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imposing a carbon tax, or similar greenhouse levy in Australia would jeopardise Australia's prospects of being part of this continuing expansion.</PARA>
<PARA>The aluminium industry has a very good track record in Australia. That report indicates that this tax would upset industry, especially industries like the aluminium industry, which depend very much on energy and would be affected by the high cost which would be imposed by this extra carbon tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the very clear and precise statement made this morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> by one of the government's advisers, Dr Joss Haines, a British environmental economist who has worked with the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. He dismissed the proposed tax on greenhouse gas emissions as being `facile and irrelevant'. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you look at Australia's position in the world, I think the figure is that Australia produces perhaps only 2 per cent of the world's emissions. Now, if you've got to save, if Australia is going to reduce its emissions by a fraction of one per cent, in global terms its a very, very small amount, and in fact it will be overwhelmed by the increases in carbon dioxide emissions which are occurring worldwide, in China, for example.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no point in one small player in the game imposing a tax on itself if nobody else does. The effect would be overwhelmed by the lack of reaction everywhere else. This is a global problem; it's a common property problem, and unless you can get global agreement, then there's little point, in my view, in one country embarking on a course of action which merely imposes costs upon itself.</PARA>
<PARA>So there we have a very clear and precise statement of the argument. On purely environmental grounds, the argument is very thin. On taxation grounds, it will have no effect on gas emissions and on the greenhouse effect. There is no doubt that the government is putting forward this proposal in order to wrap it up, as I said, in the clothes of the environmental movement. It wants to help Senator Faulkner, who no longer has the ear of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on green arguments. This is his one last throw of the dice so that when he goes to Germany and presents the government's case it will be wrapped up with the carbon tax and some other green credentials and the government will look good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the propositions put forward by former minister Kelly at the Rio convention will not be met by this government. At the time the government, with great fanfare, announced, `We will meet the greenhouse controls; we are sure to do it.' It will not meet them. This is the government's last attempt to raise revenue in order to overcome its budgetary problems and to get back on side with the green movement, which it has upset over the last three or four weeks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The substance of the matter of public importance today is the alleged imposition of a new tax which will increase costs for all Australian households and businesses. The opposition has the complete gall to come into this House and talk about tax or tax increases. There are two fundamental reasons for that. Firstly, at the last election, it campaigned vigorously on, and was handcuffed intellectually and politically to, a new 15 per cent tax on just about everything. The second fundamental reason is the tax record of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is very instructive to take note of the point that you always need to look at your history to appreciate what might come along in the future. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three points that you could make about the appalling taxation record of the Leader of the Opposition. The first relates to the size of taxation revenue as a proportion of GDP when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. The second relates to the fistful of dollars tax fraud which he perpetrated on the Australian public in 1977-78. The third relates to his absolutely appalling and disastrous record on tax evasion and avoidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the specific subject matter of the MPI is concerned, those opposite are bereft not only of policy but also of hearing. The complete answer to the MPI is found in answers to questions without notice which were directed to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) earlier this week. For the benefit of honourable members opposite, in response to a question, the Treasurer had the following to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was made quite clear at the end of last year that the government should look at maximising its response in relation to greenhouse gases. In achieving its international obligations to get emissions down to 1990 levels, the government should look at all possible means of doing that.</PARA>
<PARA>After some interjections, the Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That proposal was brought forward by the minister for the environment as something that should be looked at. The government decided that it should give the proposal some analysis, and it is being analysed at the present time. There is no decision made by the government about any such tax.</PARA>
<PARA>Repeat: `There is no decision made by the government about any such tax.' The Treasurer continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the government decides to do that or not is something which will be decided some time in the next few weeks. The minister for the environment will be going to an international conference in Berlin in March. The government will be making a decision about any such tax proposal prior to that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is not being conducted in the context of budget determinations; rather in the context of maximising our greenhouse response.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the full response to the MPI submitted this afternoon by the shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran). I have made the point that the opposition has the absolute gall to come into this House and talk in terms of tax or tax policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some important economic statistics and comparisons and the record of the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. You simply cannot take the opposition seriously when it talks about the level of taxation. When the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, was Treasurer, revenue as a percentage of GDP was over 26 per cent. In 1981-82 revenue as a percentage of GDP was 26.2 per cent, and in 1982-83 it was 26.1 per cent. So that is his record&mdash;26 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government that ratio had fallen to 23.3 per cent by 1993-94 and it is estimated to be 24 per cent for 1994-95. So there is a two per cent difference. What does that mean in real terms? It means $10 billion worth of extra taxes on Australians by the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition. That is around $550 dollars for every man, woman and child in Australia. That is what those opposite stand for: $10 billion worth of extra taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other relevant economic facts and statistics that honourable members should take note of when they come to analyse what the Leader of the Opposition might stand for, both in terms of taxation policy and economic policy. The average rate of economic growth when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer was 2.1 per cent. Under this government it has been 3.4 per cent. The rate of inflation when the member for Bennelong left office as Treasurer was 11.4 per cent. It is currently 2.5 per cent. The average rate of inflation under the member for Bennelong was 9.7 per cent. In the course of the 1990s, this year the average rate has been 2.1 per cent. When John Howard moved out of his office as Treasurer, the 90-day bank bill rate was nearly 16 per cent&mdash;15.9 per cent. Last week it was 8.2 per cent&mdash;almost half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total number of jobs created under this government is about 1.8 million. The total number of jobs that John Howard created when he was Treasurer was about 300,000. The average number of jobs created per year under John Howard as Treasurer was 52,000 and under this government it is 154,000. The statistics go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The top marginal tax rate under John Howard as Treasurer was 60 per cent; it is now 47 per cent. The bottom marginal rate under John Howard was 30 per cent; it is now 20 per cent. The company tax rate under John Howard was 46 per cent; it is now 33 per cent. Honourable members will probably recall that, at the last election, he committed himself to increasing the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent to 43 per cent, with a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History is always very illuminating. In this year, the year of the Liberal Party's 50th anniversary, we have seen the publication of the book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Menzies' Child: the Liberal Party of Australia: 1944 to 1994</EMPHASIS> by Gerard Henderson. It is well worth a read. It is also well worth ensuring that it is a book that we can rely on. We find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 12 and 13 November a review of this particular book. The reviewer states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the book is a thoughtful contribution to non-Labor politics in general and the history of the Liberal Party in particular.</PARA>
<PARA>The reviewer goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Menzies' Child</EMPHASIS> is easy to read. The insertion into the historical narrative of contemporary reflections from personal interviews is enlivening. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That review was by John Howard, member for Bennelong, Leader of the Opposition. So this is very thoughtful piece with enlivening extracts from modern-day personalities. Let us look at one of those enlivening extracts which might give us a few clues to what sort of economic conditions we might expect to experience under John Howard if he were elected. I do not need to do anything other than quote from Malcolm Fraser in an extract from the book, which is repeated in an article by Mike Steketee in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 1 and 2 October 1994, which states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> Before being rudely interrupted twice, I made the point that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) had reluctantly agreed to refer the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill to the committee I have the privilege of chairing&mdash;the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the Attorney-General's reluctance at that referral. I do not believe that any bill related to the Corporations Law has had more exhaustive consultation prior to its entry into the parliament than this particular bill. Its consultation processes were far above and beyond those required by the agreement for three-month exposure between the states and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased for two important reasons that the bill has been referred to the corporations and securities committee. Firstly, the committee has a history and background in relation to this bill, with its report on close corporations to the parliament in 1992. Secondly, if a bill of this nature has to be referred to any committee of the parliament, in the order of priority the parliament would be far wiser to refer it to either the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs or the Joint Committee on Corporations and Security. Either of those committees would do a far better job than any Senate committee. You cannot hope to receive the necessary deliberations from any Senate committee that you would receive from either the House of Representatives legal committee or the joint corporations and securities committee. I know this view is strongly shared by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), who is the chair of the legal committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Attorney-General referring this bill results in part from some pushing and prodding by the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). Unfortunately, I did not hear any of his speech today but I did speak to him privately. He stated that, if we are going to refer bills to committees, we need to get the details right and for that we need bipartisanship. I am always happy to proceed on that basis when dealing with him in his capacity as a QC. I regard him as very learned and knowledgeable in these matters. I have a high regard for him as a lawyer in the corporate area. However, that is not necessarily my view of him when it comes to policy or politics. That is why I am often heard shouting at question time when the member for Tangney is two-thirds through his question that perhaps he is still being paid by the hour for his political contributions in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The First Corporate Law Simplification Bill reminds me of a few anti-lawyer jokes. Like the member for Tangney, I am  admitted to the Supreme Court of Western Australia and therefore have standing to make these asides by way of self-deprecation. I suppose the most appropriate anti-lawyer joke in regard to this bill is that which asks, `What is the definition of 500 lawyers and a white pointer shark at the bottom of the ocean?' The answer is `A good start.' This bill is a good start to the simplification process in a very important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with process rather than substance because the substance of the bill has been referred to the committee I chair. It is important that the Corporations Law is simple and easily understood not just for judges and lawyers but also for its users. More often than not corporate law aficionados are the only ones who take an interest in these matters. I think that is, first, a mistake and, second, unfortunate. The basis of our corporate law takes with it investor confidence and confidence in the structure of our economy. It is one of the very important factors in determining whether we are internationally competitive. So it is very important to get these matters right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), who is at the table, was somewhat amused with my good start joke. A couple of others come to mind along the lines of plain English, which is at the heart of these reform measures. It is often alleged that all lawyers come from the same class. That is true: they come from Mr Templeton's 1914 Latin class, Melbourne Grammar. One is also reminded of the notion that lawyers are not particularly good at law reform. Lawyers have been involved in this process of law reform. I think it is a very good process of law reform. I am sure the minister at the table will know the answer to the question `How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?' The answer is `None, because lawyers have not changed anything for many years.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a more serious note, when the honourable member for Tangney spoke on this bill I was chairing a meeting of the corporations and securities committee. We were fortunate today, quite by coincidence, to be briefed by the task force involved in the simplification process. The committee exhaustively went through the processes undertaken by that task force. While I will not bore the House with the detail of those consultative processes, they go far and above the usual three-month exposure requirement which follows from the Commonwealth-state arrangement. Some members might be aware of the task force proposals put out firstly by a Plan of Action and secondly by exposure drafts. The members of the task force told the committee today that they found that process most illuminating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important general point to be made about the simplification process is: simple law is important because it is in many ways the first step in ensuring effective access to justice. If people can understand the law, they can act on their rights and obligations without the need for professional advice. Where they need professional advice, such advice ought to be cheaper and less likely to be beyond the means of the client. Extensive disputes about the content of the law should also be less likely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thrust of this bill is to simplify the provisions of the Corporations Law. It is the first step in a comprehensive program to reduce complexity in the law and an endeavour to ensure that the law is understood not just by business, lawyers and judges but also by users, so that they can have a clear understanding of the legislation. It also attempts to promote economic efficiency because of the importance of this area of law to a competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplification task force, as part of its consultative process, held a series of simplification seminars throughout the Commonwealth in the last quarter of last year. One member of the task force, Mr Robert Eagleson, who is an expert in plain English and in the drafting of legislation, delivered a paper at such a seminar in Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before entering parliament, I had the opportunity as principal private secretary to the Attorney-General of Western Australia to work closely with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in Western Australia. For a time the Chief Parliamentary Counsel for Western Australia was Mr Garth Thornton, who is by birth a New Zealander. We will not hold that against him. He is the author of the very well regarded book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Legislative drafting</EMPHASIS>. I was pleased to discover in discussions with Mr Eagleson this morning that he has the same high regard for Mr Thornton as I do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Mr Thornton's third edition, he makes some points about the need to ensure our legislation is drafted clearly. He refers to the updating of his book from the late 1970s to the time of its publication in 1987. Where referring to his collection of notes since 1979 he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find phrases such as `tortuous and incomprehensible' and `appalling nonsense' to be not uncommon. The demand for legislation to be better drafted in a more intelligible fashion, of which I wrote in the preface to the second edition, has gained in strength. It is, I believe, a healthy and very proper demand, but it is not one that is likely to or should lead to dramatic change.</PARA>
<PARA>Time will tell whether it leads to dramatic change. There is an important point to make about Mr Thornton's perception and knowledge in this area. In 1987, he was far-sighted among his peers as to the importance of drafting in plain English and getting it right.  I am pleased that nearly a decade later Mr Eagleson is taking up the cudgels so effectively. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members opposite should listen to me because they might learn something&mdash;and that would be a big improvement on the day. We are looking at legislation that has a number of purposes. I specifically want to talk to that section which attempts to reform some areas of small business corporations. Historically, this is something that this government has been attempting, going right back to the time when Lionel Bowen was Attorney-General and he produced the close corporations act that was so complex and such a disaster that it was referred&mdash;as we propose with this legislation&mdash;to a Senate committee and never saw the light of day again. It was a great bipartisan effort&mdash;everybody thought it was a heap of garbage and, consequently, it was never proceeded with.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those years have gone by and we have the government coming up again, after a task force and green and red coloured publications, giving us some sort of proposal of how it might address what is a genuine problem. The problem is the cost and current complexity of attempting to register a small business as a proprietary limited company. It has certainly got it wrong again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the government does not really seem to recognise the substantial need of a proprietary company for a small business. The substantial need, outside of avoiding some of the complexity and cost, is to ensure that some of your shareholders at least get the benefit of the corporate structure&mdash;in other words, they are not liable for any more than their actual investment. This is very important in many small businesses that are family structures where, frequently, younger members of the family set out on some business</PARA>
<PARA>venture like plumbing or something of that nature and seek support from their parents or other more financially substantial relatives. There is nothing here that goes far enough in trying to identify where those secondary shareholders will not be pressed, as they are today, for personal guarantees. It is extremely risky for such people to be asked to mortgage their homes because they are part of this business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a solution to that. This legislation goes in the opposite direction. As has been suggested on a number of occasions, instead of having a corporate structure specific to small business where the directors have an automatic liability but shareholders have limited liability, this proposal further worsens the situation for bad debts by reducing the number of shareholders to one and the number of directors to one&mdash;in other words, encouraging people who really do not qualify for a corporate structure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> We might invite all these people to stay because the advice I would give them might even win them a few small business supporters&mdash;they have not got many as things are these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are these changes too little too late, the message is the wrong one. Fundamentally, it reduces the number of directors but gives them no additional responsibility. It reduces shareholders to one, which seems to demonstrate no real or appropriate need to have a company. But, once people have discovered whether they are a small or a large business, it will reduce or remove the requirement for people to lodge financial returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in itself is a matter of grave concern to me. I am entirely supportive of a concept to simplify those returns and have held the view that very small companies may, for instance, have been able to lodge a little bit of additional information with their tax returns as their only requirement. That could have been forwarded on to the ASC or been available for public scrutiny within the tax office or whatever. That could have been a simplified approach to keeping the information relative to a proprietary company on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, like others, have been in business and experienced the tragedy for your business of another proprietary company going broke. In fact, the inability to establish the true financial circumstances of another company can be a contributing factor to that. This legislation is making that situation more difficult for honest companies seeking to give credit, which is part of their business, to achieve that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> I have made the principal point I wanted to, so I am not greatly concerned about the loss of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to repeat the situation, because it was interesting to see how far the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) was willing to go into matters of various reports in newspapers and things regarding the Liberal Party&mdash;one of these Labor history lessons. Everybody builds everything on history in the Labor Party and not on the future which our children would appreciate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want you to visualise this limited reporting as it would have applied to the member for Perth when he was secretary to the Labor Party and he had all those senior members of his political party stealing Labor Party funds. He had no way of checking on that if the party is incorporated. We are not making allegations. One senior minister happens to have been gaoled for stealing money; another has been charged; and your premier member has been charged with stealing Labor Party funds&mdash;just $125,000. These are the issues you cannot handle. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is where I will leave it. The point I make is that, when these blokes want to stand up and read this sort of rubbish, they suddenly start shaking their heads when they get a little bit of it back. The fundamental facts are that, if the ALP is incorporated, which it may be in Western Australia, the member for Perth as party secretary did not have much chance of checking up what was going on. He should never criticise anyone in this place, considering the record of how Labor Party members have dealt with their party's money. We might add to that the wonderful commission of $600,000 that Terry Burke got. I bet he was supposed to get $600,000. That was more likely the gap between what they got and what he collected, which the WA Inc. inquiry so clearly uncovered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the legislation, these are the issues. The simple and untouched fact is that, with these changes, we will not have the improvement small business needs. These changes do nothing for middle sized companies, because their concern is to raise capital on a market with a degree of simplicity. More recent changes to security law have made it almost impossible for anyone other than very large business enterprises to get listed on the Stock Exchange&mdash;and that is a pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issues are: capital for very small business and a simple structure that still contains a process of public reporting. The only thing this legislation is doing is knocking out the public reporting as a means of simplifying the responsibilities of small businesses. That is not what we want. There are a lot of small businesses which need that reporting to be able to assess the creditworthiness of their clients from time to time so they do not become the victims, as so many have, of the sorts of crashes that occur when relatively good businesses go broke simply because of the credit they have given to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this legislation does well to go to a committee where these sorts of things can be considered. I am all for the concept of making this more simple. I am opposed, however, to a situation where we see people not being able to get access to the normal records that would be available with a proprietary limited company. I am sure there are simple ways&mdash;I can propose one&mdash;whereby both of the objectives could be achieved: for example, simplification and public reporting. If that were to come out of this inquiry which the coalition proposes in its second reading amendment, it would be to the benefit of all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendments moved by my colleague the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I preface my remarks by saying that I am in favour of the simplification process, of language becoming such that ordinary Australians can understand it. I am interested in what may be termed not the unintended consequences of the First Corporate Law Simplification Bill but the intended consequences of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer specifically to schedule 4 of the bill, which deletes the need for small corporations, as defined by the bill, to file returns. I am particularly concerned about the definition and the requirement not to have to file returns, because it will exempt the Labor Party from putting on the public record the details about its operating companies and will allow it, quite frankly, to circumvent the disclosure provisions which pertain to political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that for a specific reason. I turn first to a corporation known as John Curtin House Ltd. John Curtin House, under the definition set out in the bill, would qualify as a small proprietary company and be exempt from filing returns because it meets two out of the three criteria. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> As I was saying, one of the things that concerns me about this legislation is that it provides for the Labor Party to circumvent the provisions and the need, as imposed by legislation, for financial disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made by one or two of the folk on the other side of the House who are able to read about a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> the other day about the Liberal Party's disclosure, made quite properly. It talked about the amount of money that had been donated to our campaign, all set out perfectly correctly. What it did not say in that article, and what we obtained from the accounts of John Curtin House Ltd&mdash;which is the owner of Centenary House in Barton and which, upon the signing of the agreement for a 15-year, nine per cent annual increment lease, is netting the Labor Party $34 million above the market value over 15 years&mdash;is that, the moment it was signed, the Macquarie Bank lent to, or made available for drawing down for, the Australian Labor Party the sum of $50 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accounts that were disclosed at the end of its financial accounting year to 30 September 1992 showed that it had drawn down just over $14 million. It then changed its accounting period and the next set of accounts was for 18 months. The accounts show it has now drawn down $22 million. That means that at any given moment the Labor Party has access to $28 million. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> As I said, my concern is that, if this legislation is passed, the Labor Party&mdash;as perhaps an intended consequence&mdash;would be able to circumvent the disclosure laws as to the method of financing political parties. I pointed out that, at the time of the signing of the agreement to lease John Curtin House Ltd&mdash;the owner of Centenary House&mdash;the Macquarie Bank made $50 million available to the Labor Party. The Labor Party has drawn down $22 million of that amount, about $16 million being used for the development of the building, which is now valued at $32.5 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, Mr Della Bosca, the secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales and the company secretary of Labor Centenary House Pty Ltd, has given an undertaking to supply the required financial data by 30 June 1994. He has not done so. He says that he cannot supply it because it is in the hands of volunteers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly the Australian Securities Commission is required to take action. Of course, if this legislation passes through in its current form the company will not be obliged to file such a return again. That is why I am concerned about the intended consequences of this legislation. It attempts to hide the Labor Party's financial dealings from scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House of the figure that the Labor Party has available to it at any given time: the ability to draw down $28 million courtesy of the Macquarie Bank. I also remind the House that the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales owes the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;the same one that Mr Keating owed through his piggery&mdash;$5.5 million. Indeed, the company has reneged on the payment and the bank has not foreclosed. Why not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Labor Party has $28.5 million in its coffers. That money is available to pay the debts of the New South Wales division. Why is the money not being claimed? Why is the money not being paid? The Commonwealth Bank has a charge on John Curtin House Pty Ltd and that takes precedence over the charge of the Macquarie Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many questions that need to be answered before this committee to which the legislation may be referred. One question is whether or not the consequences that flow from this bill are intended or unintended. Perhaps we need to look at a very close requirement that the Labor Party and its corporations will still be required to file these returns so that the community can be acquainted with how the Labor Party is spending its money. The main source of revenue for John Curtin House is the rent from Centenary House in Barton. It is a lease for 15 years with annual increments of nine per cent, totalling rent payable over 15 years of $86 million. That is $34 million above market rental. That pays for a lot of elections. It bypasses the spirit of disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side has agreed that the Liberal Party has properly disclosed all its accounts and its source of money.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity today to speak in this debate on the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the associated bill. Health care or, more specifically, the state of the private health care system is a matter that should concern all Australians because, ultimately, it will affect them all. This debate is a very important one as it will shape the future of our private health care providers, which in turn will impact on the wider health care system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's annual health care bill amounts to $34 billion, based on 1992-93 figures, or approximately 8.5 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product. Of that amount, the Commonwealth meets around 44 per cent of our total health budget; the states a further 23 per cent; and the private sector 32 per cent. This 32 per cent is made up of: private health insurance, 13 per cent; and out-of-pocket payments by individuals, 19 per cent. So, as demonstrated, private health insurance still provides a significant component of the overall health care funding in this country; hence the need to ensure its survival in the health sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole package of reform now before the House was ostensibly born of a genuine concern about the viability of the overall health care system, both public and private. The former health minister, the former Senator Richardson, on 10 September 1993 admitted that you cannot have a healthy public sector unless there is a vibrant public sector. He recognised the looming crisis in our public health system and, with the increasing fallout from the private health insurance system, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One reason why those waiting lists are long, why it is such a difficulty, is that we've let private health insurance numbers get too low . . . the drift into the public system has, I think, gotten to the stage now where we can't take it any more.</PARA>
<PARA>Note the `we can't take it any more'; that was from the previous health minister. Certainly, the statistics show an alarming fall in the number of privately insured. The participation rate has fallen from around 59 per cent in February 1984, prior to the introduction of Medicare, to currently around 37 per cent and it is still falling&mdash;a 22 percentage point decline in just 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of more concern should be the change in profile of our insured population. Older Australians are comprising an increasing proportion of the privately insured population. During 1992-93, the number of people aged 65 and over with private health insurance increased by 12,000 to 844,000, while the number aged 64 years and under fell by a massive 208,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes should ring alarm bells, not only for the private health sector but also for the public health system. The effect of a big drop in overall insurance numbers, particularly among young people, will result in private health insurance premiums rising, forcing even more patients into the already overcrowded public health queue&mdash;a queue that we were told has some 112,000 Australians waiting in line. They cannot get into the public hospitals because people, like our Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who can afford to take out private health insurance have not done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) demonstrated the wider impact of the haemorrhaging health care system when she said, in her speech on the second reading:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimate is that for every one per cent of people who leave private health insurance&mdash;and we are now down to 36.6 per cent&mdash;it costs the government, or rather the taxpayer, another $100 million in services that have to be provided in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: it costs taxpayers $100 million more to prop up the public system for every one per cent of people who leave private health insurance. To me, this underlines the seriousness of the problem facing our health system and highlights the importance of reform to stem the haemorrhaging of our private health sector and, ultimately, of our total health care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms debated today and yesterday should ideally be about restoring a healthy balance between our private and public health care systems. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) says that the reforms will place the health insurance industry in a position to achieve efficiency gains and enable it to pass on the benefits of those gains to members in the form of lower premiums and better controlled costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the industry, the private hospitals and also the coalition do not see the reforms in such a glossy light, a fact that has been highlighted in this debate. There is still great uncertainty and concern about this legislation and whether or not it will exacerbate the current health care crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look closely at some of the proposed reforms. The first of the reforms outlined is that of 1 April 1995: private health insurance funds can enter into contracts with individual hospitals and medical practitioners, the so called purchaser-provider agreements. Technically, that is nothing new as private insurers are already able, with almost complete freedom, to negotiate with private hospitals on the payment of benefits to cover hospital charges. Where such health funds and hospitals have been unable to strike an agreement, there has always been a safety net or a minimum level of payment to be paid by a health fund for accommodation in a private hospital, that being the basic table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this legislation does not provide for a minimum benefit where the hospital does not have an agreement with the health fund. That has been brought to my attention by Mr Kim Knoblauch, the Chief Executive Officer of the Bundaberg Friendly Society Private Hospital. Mr Knoblauch points out that with the removal of the basic table&mdash;the old intermediate fee&mdash;there will be no discipline whatsoever on health funds to meet some private level unless this is nominated by the government. It must also be understood that small private hospitals, in particular, will not have the resources to be able to take such matters to the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, private hospital operators who rely on health funds for 85 per cent of their revenue are concerned at these arrangements which more or less force them into an agreement with a health fund. If they are not happy to do that they receive no payment. The minister says there will be a transition period up to 1 July 1997, during which the fund will be required to provide a benefit payment at a level determined by the fund. The minister described this as an incentive for hospitals to enter into contracts, but the hospitals are certainly viewing it somewhat differently. According to the Australian Private Hospitals Association:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential effects of giving private health insurers this power would give unprecedented and unwarranted power to private health insurers and would be devastating to the future of Australian health care.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the question of competition amongst health funds or, should I say, the lack of it. In some states such as Western Australia, one private health insurance company totally dominates, holding 80 per cent of the market. In Queensland, MBF controls 63 per cent of the private health insurance market and Medibank some 30 per cent, a total of 93 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the private health insurers own and control a significant number of private hospitals in their own right. The possibility of a private health insurer favouring its own hospital to the detriment of any competing hospital would seem rather tempting. There is a prima facie case of conflict of interest. The government is relying on the Trade Practices Act to ensure that fair and reasonable activity between the funds and hospitals will occur. But the coalition and the private hospital industry, particularly the small players in regional areas, are not so sure. As the APHA states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In states like Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia and in certain regional centres, the survival or otherwise of private hospitals would be determined, not necessarily by their ability to provide high quality, cost effective services but by the desires and decisions of one private health insurer.</PARA>
<PARA>Even smaller private health care providers&mdash;such as the Sisters of Mercy Health Care Services, which operates the Mater Misericordiae Hospitals in Bundaberg, Rockhampton and Mackay&mdash;have expressed similar grave concerns. The chief executive officer of the Bundaberg operation, Mr Peter Crane, tells me that he has been advised that `an opinion from the Trade Practices Commission suggests that a fund could ignore one hospital and not contravene the Trade Practices Act'. </PARA>
<PARA>That, I suggest, is most concerning. There is a genuine concern amongst private health care providers about the power to be given to health funds under this proposed legislation. There is an obvious need for greater consultation and discussion with the industry about these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An equally concerning reform contained in the legislation is the fundamental shift in the type of private health insurance payment system to be based on casemix payments. After 1 July 1997, the basic and supplementary insurance tables will no longer exist. Contracts between health funds and hospitals will have to be structured on the basis of a casemix payment system. The minister says that the implementation of casemix payments will improve the efficiency within hospitals and improve the quality and outcome of health care. Another person in the health care industry said to me, `Is it not the case that the government has got the health funds to do its dirty business?' Again, there is genuine uncertainty amongst private health care providers about the merits of casemix based payments. Again I quote Peter Crane, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I question whether the health funds and private hospitals are adequately prepared for a casemix based system . . . in the private system . . . if the rates are wrong, either the funds or the hospitals will be in financial difficulty, there cannot be an end of year adjustment because payment is made for each patients episode of care.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, once the payment has been levied and the patient has left the hospital, you cannot go back over the same ground. I am also concerned about another small hospital in my area, the Friendly Society Private Hospital. This is a modern, well-equipped facility which is maintained by the friendly societies, a group of lodges in the Bundaberg area. They have built it up to a superb $5 million facility. This hospital, would you believe, for its 14-day bed rate charges the schedule fee. In other words, the health insurance rebate, as it is currently structured, covers the full cost of hospitalisation in most cases. In other words, you can know that if you are in the top scale of medical benefits you can be treated in that hospital with the best of theatres, ensuited rooms and so on, for the schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The danger is that the health funds, knowing the efficiency of a hospital such as this one, could demand even more. How much extra can they demand from a hospital which has already screwed down its costs to the basic schedule fee? Kim Knoblauch, the CEO of that hospital, pointed out to me that the funds will have access to all the hospital costings. There will be no such thing as commercial privacy. This makes any hospital vulnerable to a fund and certainly makes smaller hospitals particularly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make the point&mdash;perhaps it is not of the same concern, but it is of some concern&mdash;that some of the small funds may have the same difficulty in negotiating with big hospital chains. I do not see anywhere in the minister's explanation an addressing of these fundamental problems. If the thing gets out of control in the early days without any regulatory processes, we are going to have not only a difficult health situation on our hands but an absolute national shambles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate should be about stemming the tide of people leaving private health insurance, adding to the woes of the overcrowded public hospital system. It should be about restoring a better balance in our health care system overall. The government has focused on contractual arrangements and casemix funding as the answer to reducing the cost of private health care insurance premiums&mdash;the primary reason people are leaving health funds in such big numbers. However, the APHA does not believe that these reforms will result in much greater improvements in efficiencies or health care fund premiums. The APHA states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if a 10% efficiency could be extracted from private hospitals, the cost of health insurance could potentially reduce less than $1 per week, not sufficient to make any difference to the number insured.</PARA>
<PARA>There have been concerns expressed from some sectors of the health care industry that there has not been enough consultation on these proposed reforms, in particular from consumer groups and private hospitals. This makes the amendments of the member for Mackellar all the more relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the conflicting views and opinions expressed about this legislation, I strongly support the thrust of the coalition's second reading amendment calling for greater scrutiny of these proposed reforms through a Senate committee. There is too much at stake here. There is not only the future of our private hospitals but the state of our overall health care system which, like the human body, is made up of many parts but which must all be kept in balance to operate effectively. I conclude with a quote from Greg Herring, the Executive Director of the APHA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again, nothing in the package will bring the cost of comprehensive private health insurance down.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eighty percent of people drop insurance because of price, so that there is unlikely to be any deceleration in the fall out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once again Labor is fiddling at the edges and not addressing the real problem.</PARA>

It is a role that I am very much looking forward to fulfilling. I am the final speaker for the coalition in this debate, a debate that was led by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). I want to record my thanks to her for her work as my predecessor and her work in doing the consultation on these pieces of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the new shadow minister for health, I want to reaffirm the position stated by the honourable member for Mackellar at the outset of this debate. The coalition has serious difficulties with the government's legislation. We have sufficiently strong reservations about features of these bills, and we will seek to amend those in another place. We intend to go some way to rectifying the lack of government consultation over this legislation, which has to be the most fundamentally important change in private health over the last decade. It is being done without adequate consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to go into great detail, especially given the contributions of my colleagues throughout the debate. I will, however, give the House some observations on the more significant elements of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at any legislation or policy proposal, it is wise to try to put oneself in the shoes of the government and get some idea of the outcomes it is seeking. In the present instance, I believe there are four outcomes that the government has in mind: making private health insurance a more attractive product to health consumers and to halt the decline in private health coverage; defining the future role of private hospitals in Australian health care; restraining the growth of hospital costs; and introducing and entrenching case payments in the private hospital system and in private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say that the coalition accepts that there is some merit in these goals&mdash;in some, there is particular merit. We too want to see a healthy system where there is a mix of public and private provision, and we want to see private health funds and private hospitals having an essential role in looking to provide the best possible services to their consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we differ from the government is that, rather than seeing private health insurance as a supplement to Medicare, we see it as essential and complementary to Medicare. This was put very well by the former Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, who said that if private health insurance falls below 40 per cent Medicare is not going to work. We are now at 36.7 per cent and people are continuing to fall out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week I have examined the legislation and heard a range of views from industry groups, service providers, professional groups and consumers. Having done so, I do not believe the government has achieved its first three objectives, and I think it has only imperfectly dealt with the question of casemix's introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than go over ground that has already been very thoroughly trodden, I would like to have a look at the implications of the legislation for the immediate future of both private health insurance and private hospitals. In her second reading speech, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of this legislation is on strengthening consumer rights and making private health insurance better value for money.</PARA>
<PARA>I think these measures have missed the point. The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals summed up the government's dilemma pretty neatly in its November 1994 discussion paper on the minister's package when it wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms appear to concentrate on . . . reducing out of pocket expenses . . . rather than concentrating on reducing the actual month by month cost associated with paying premiums that is a major reason for consumers to cancel their membership.</PARA>
<PARA>This is central. If you look at the two-yearly Australian health survey that is done, in the last survey in 1993, 63 per cent of people who dropped out of private health insurance nominated the cost as the reason. This does absolutely nothing whatsoever in the short term to address that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only 10 per cent of people nominated out-of-pocket expenses as the reason they were dropping out of private health insurance. So this fundamentally fails to deal with the principal reason for the decline in private health insurance coverage. That said, this bill makes possible the covering of those usually unexpected extras that can come with hospital treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is something that my colleague the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) has had recent cause to have an encounter with, and to which he can attest. But, while on the surface this is a positive move, there has been nothing in the evidence presented to me or to my colleagues that suggests the cost of private health insurance will not increase under the government package. It certainly will not fall in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Mackellar has outlined the coalition's arguments on these elements of the legislation. I share her concerns that there is no guarantee in the government package that purchaser-provider agreements will preserve the contributor's freedom of choice of doctor and place of care. This is important for the simple reason that that element of freedom of choice is perhaps the prime attraction for consumers in taking out private health insurance in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain to be convinced that this new dimension to private insurance will be welcomed by the community which, if the evidence is correct, is barely aware of these proposals at all. I suspect that the lure of out-of-pocket coverage under the purchaser-provider agreements will not be the magic ingredient to attract people back to private insurance. I am also not convinced that the measures will necessarily improve cost competition between funds for the consumer dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unreasonable to argue that purchaser-provider agreements and the proposed changes to the management of the reinsurance pool will create irresistible pressures on smaller funds to amalgamate with larger funds. I am also aware of concerns expressed to the coalition that small restricted funds will find the present model heavy going. They will often lack the resources that larger funds have to develop a wide network of purchaser-provider arrangements. These smaller and restricted funds are important in the total private health network. They provide access to private health insurance that many people and many trade unionists of more limited means would not normally have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My prediction, one that I suspect the minister might share, is that the next few years will see a significant shake-out of the number of funds competing for a still declining number of people taking out private health insurance. I do not see this as a good outcome. I see diversity of choice as a positive goal that should be shared by all health policy makers. I would prefer to see a market that can embrace a range of insurers&mdash;large and small; open and restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not convinced about the legislation's provision for contributors who require treatment at a hospital, day procedure facility or by a medical practitioner not covered by a purchaser-provider agreement with his or her fund, whether because of emergency or because of the nature of the treatment. In our second reading amendments, the coalition has foreshadowed an amendment to the legislation proposing the introduction of a default rebate&mdash;a level of 50 per cent has been suggested&mdash;in those instances where a contributor cannot avail himself or herself of an agreed provider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fundamentally important fall back. It is all very well to say that funds will not behave in a certain way. We have no guarantee of that. It is all very well to say that funds will be covered by the Trade Practices Commission. It cannot cover a system where funds do not agree to negotiate in the first place. I do not see any safeguard here for funds choosing not to negotiate with hospitals that might have a profile that does not suit what they want to attract&mdash;hospitals that are known to have a large number of older patients needing joint replacements; and other things that are unprofitable to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's legislation offers patients who have to go to a private hospital outside their fund's purchaser-provider agreement only an `average level of benefit' for emergency episodes and a level of benefit subject to the insurer's discretion for non-emergency admissions. In a perfect world that might be acceptable, but private health insurance is not a perfect world. The obligation to provide even a non-emergency benefit will cease on 1 July 1998. We do not find that acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the principle of freedom of choice for consumers is going to be maintained, it seems to us that maintenance of a reasonable default benefit for non-agreement care is both commonsense and equitable. We on this side accept and realise that a person cannot have control over all the circumstances of the management of his or her illness or condition. We would be loath to see a situation where, for example, a person's wait for elective surgery is delayed or long distances need to be travelled because his or her health fund does not have a purchaser-provider agreement with a convenient hospital or day procedure facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my mind nothing is more guaranteed to undermine public confidence in the value of private health insurance than the frustration caused by such delays and inconvenience. This is why the coalition would urge the government not to dismiss the notion of a default benefit and why we will seek to amend the legislation in the other place to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the future of private hospitals under the government's proposal? Since becoming shadow minister for health just over a week ago, I have met with or received submissions from a range of hospital industry groups on this legislation. As the minister would know, this portfolio, perhaps more than any other, has a large number of articulate and keenly interested groups that wish to put a particular point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of views about what the future holds for private hospitals under the model we are debating vary from the highly optimistic to the overly pessimistic. But the prevailing mood is one of serious uncertainty and concern about the long-term future of private hospitals and other private care facilities. This model changes the relationship between hospitals, health funds and health consumers. By creating a direct reimbursement relationship between the funds and the Health Insurance Commission, and by enabling funds to negotiate purchaser-provider agreements based on casemix, the government is placing the funds in a potentially very powerful position to determine the future shape and direction of private hospital care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three groups that are important in private health: the funds, the hospitals and the providers. It is dangerous to give any of those three groups a potential to have a significant advantage over the others. A reasonable balance between those three groups&mdash;the providers, the hospitals and the insurers&mdash;I believe is in the public interest. My colleagues and I are concerned that the spread of purchaser-provider agreements will make the environment much tougher for many private hospitals, particularly those in non-metropolitan areas for which patient cost of care is often relatively high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not like to see a situation where funds negotiate unduly tough agreements, or negotiate not at all, with regional care facilities. I am also concerned that it will be the hospitals that will bear the brunt of cost containment as they, in their turn, contract with practitioners to provide professional services and episodic packages. This model will work only if practitioners are satisfied with the rewards of working in the private sector. If practitioners feel the financial return is not worth their while, they may vote with their feet from a particular private hospital practice, to the detriment of the system and the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three areas I will talk about briefly that are key objections in my mind. One is the timing for the contracts which is set to be 1 July 1995. We think it would be much more preferable if it were 1 July 1996. Doctors are not the only people who provide services in private hospitals. There are also physiotherapists, occupational therapists and specialist nurses. I have had considerable experience as a provider of some services in orthopaedic surgery. In orthopaedic surgery, the physiotherapists are absolutely crucial. There are people with specialist knowledge of a particular surgeon or a particular type of surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hospitals will have to negotiate with a large range of people. The professional associations covering paramedical and other health professionals are very concerned at the introduction of this legislation. They do not feel that there has been adequate time to consult. They do not feel that three months will be adequate time to have negotiations in place. We are not saying that this will never be finalised, but we are saying that a much more reasonable period of time would be 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern is casemix. I believe casemix, as a general form of hospital care funding, is a very positive development in Australian health care. Spreading casemix to private hospitals and private health insurance is almost inevitable and we do not oppose this per se. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister knows, there is considerable concern in the provider sector about the speed of implementation of the first phase of this package from 1 April onwards, and about the administrative and planning burdens and costs that this timetable imposes on them. While I am aware that the government is proposing the first phase as a transitional period with the old tables and casemix based agreements co-existing, no one can predict how the market will react when the green light goes up on 1 April. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of particular concern that is a key objection of the coalition is the notion of data collection. This is going to provide very substantial information to the government about private health episodes. There is some merit in having that information available. There is merit in some medical practitioners having to face the consequences of their treatment decisions, their prescribing or ordering patterns. I can see merit in people, if they have certain practice patterns that are very high cost, at least being aware of it and having to confront that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid I cannot see why the government must be the body that collects the information. I cannot see why the government must be the body that has it. The government could still have everything it needs and have an independent authority collecting that information. Anyone who needed it, whether it be government, private insurers or consumer groups, could then have access to it in a sanitised form that protected privacy and the community interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be moving amendments in another place. We will be seeking referral to a committee, not to delay it, because potentially some of these proposals could be worth while, but there has not been adequate consultation on what is a very major change to private health insurance. We think that some of these issues need to be fleshed out. We hope the government will look seriously at some of our proposed amendments. We are not able to support this legislation in its present form. If the government is prepared to look at our amendments, we may be able to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank all the contributors to the debate, in particular, the constructive contribution by the current shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). I want to outline briefly the context in which we are discussing the Health Legislation (Private Health Insurance Reform) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Private Health Insurance Complaints Levy Bill 1994&mdash;that is, a very substantial change over the last decade in the way in which health is financed. I think that is what we really need to talk about&mdash;the way in which health is financed in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was a relative latecomer to universal health insurance. Many of our OECD partners have had similar programs for a very long time and have a great deal more experience than we have. Nonetheless, the way that it was introduced in Australia, at least since the mid-1980s, has meant that we have a very substantial and worthy system of health financing in this country. In addition, we have a private health insurance market, we have private health providers, who also have a long history in our country and, again, who are a very worthy and important part of our health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put the private health insurance and private health sector in context. We introduced Medibank in the 1970s. A former Prime Minister, the Hon. Gough Whitlam, introduced for the first time a universal health insurance system. That was subsequently and systematically dismantled under conservative governments, principally by Malcolm Fraser and John Howard, despite very clear promises to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was reintroduced as Medicare by Labor in the mid-1980s. Since then it has had very wide public endorsement and acceptance and, indeed, now appears to enjoy the regard of the opposition, at least in its key elements&mdash;basically because it is good policy. When I attended the OECD meeting in Paris last year, it was very clear that Medicare in Australia is held in high regard internationally. Indeed, it is looked to by many developing countries and emerging countries as a model. It is interesting, as the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) indicated yesterday, that our people&mdash;I refer to John Deeble&mdash;are now advising the South African government about how they might provide similar support for their community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central tenet of this government's health policy has always been, now over a 30-year period, universal access to high quality public health for all Australians, insured out of the taxation system and with the addition of a Medicare levy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context we obviously also value the role of the private health sector and the private health insurance market. But, as I have indicated, the private health sector has essentially an additional supplementary role. That is not to say it is unimportant; nor that it would not be difficult, if the system collapsed tomorrow, to replace it. Of course, it would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private sector participation rates are therefore, in my view, not the kind of critical issue that has been portrayed by the coalition, because we have a commitment in policy to all Australians to provide universal health access by way of a universal health insurance system. The additions we have to that and the choices they might make through private health insurance essentially supplement that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of Australians elect to have private health coverage. That is their right. The government is intent through this legislation on providing them with value for money. They have a right, as consumers, to get a good product, not to pay too much for it and to know what it covers. They are simply the key elements of these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister indicated a moment ago in his speech that he thought the private health insurance funds now have too great a role and too much power in determining the outcomes of the private health market. But what we have seen is a shift from the consumers and the private health funds, who, after all, are insuring them against ill health, moving from being price takers&mdash;they essentially had no choice about what price they would pay and what the consumers would pay&mdash;to price negotiators. They cannot dictate terms because they are required to provide hospital and medical services from the existing arrangement of hospitals and doctors. So, instead of being price takers, forced to negotiate with every hospital on the terms that they insisted upon, now, on behalf of consumers, they can be negotiators and, in my view, as a result of this legislation, get a better result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the state of the private health system. We have been told by a number of people that it is in crisis. In the analysis that has been undertaken by the former shadow minister, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and the current one, I hear resonances&mdash;because I meet with these people, too&mdash;of some fairly clearly vested private health sector interests. The coalition apparently believes the tales of hardship from the private sector operators and offers what I would say is the time-honoured coalition response&mdash;tax breaks and other barely hidden subsidies, rather than putting the wood on the industry to perform better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that if you dig behind the declining participation rate, and it has been declining since we introduced universal health insurance&mdash;indeed, in part it was designed to decline; we did not want to have everybody necessarily in the private health sector, and that is why we introduced universal health insurance&mdash;you find that the health insurers at the moment have record levels of reserves. Far from being bankrupt or facing severe problems in meeting emerging demands on their funds, they have reserves well in excess of the statutory requirements&mdash;sometimes three and four times what is necessary. That is as likely to be true of the small, closed funds as it is of some of the larger ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another fact rather than a myth: private hospitals have record levels of admissions at the moment. I give them credit for the fact that they have moved into the day surgery market. They have got a lot of compensation work. Importantly, as well as the privately insured, they have a range of admissions who have come from those who are self-insured. The profitability in the for-profit sector is at record levels. Look at their end-of-year results. We are not talking here about an industry in decline.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at investment levels&mdash;you have only to move around, as I do, and visit the private hospitals&mdash;you will see that they are at record levels. So investors are continuing to put money into these new capital developments. If they thought there was no future in the private health market, I would say they would not be doing that. I have a great deal of respect for investors. I think they do their homework very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers, however, are pretty disenchanted with what they see as poor value for money products and services. Many of them, as we have seen, have been electing to drop their coverage. The people who have been dropping coverage are those most likely to get poor value for money, that is, the young and the fit. They do not use the services very often, they pay a large amount for it and at the moment they do not regard it as a good investment. And who can blame them? An increasing number of people, too, at the wealthy end of the market are self-insured. That is a market that is waiting to be captured by the insurers if they give them value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's answer to all of this&mdash;in so far as I have been able to discern one&mdash;is, as we have heard, to oppose this bill, to move some amendments and also to indicate that their proposal would see significant tax subsidisation at the cost of billions of dollars to the public health system. I was very interested to note today that the shadow minister put out a press release suggesting that there were plans afoot to significantly reduce Medicare and other benefits payments, he says to the tune of 10 per cent per annum, amounting over four financial cycles to $5.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that being fantasy, I point out to members that, if you actually undertook the sorts of proposals that were endorsed by the party under the former shadow minister, $1.1 billion is considerably less than half that which is actively contemplated by way of tax subsidies. So, unless the opposition has a magic pudding, it has a very shallow understanding of funding in this area. If you take $12 billion, or even if you are operating on the figure of $1.5 billion a year, you have to find it from somewhere. Where do you find it? The public health system. How do you do that? The hospitals then have to foot the bill; they have to find further areas in which to make cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister disappoints me. He gave a very measured response to the bill, but this particular press release is far from measured. It makes some extraordinary claims about things that are not going to occur and, in addition, overlooks the fact that his own party has over time embraced a program that says, `Let's ensure that there are public subsidies to the tune of $1.5 to $3 billion a year,' depending on who you listen to, which will come from the public purse&mdash;from the health budget. Clearly, that is unacceptable. The government's answer to the problems in private health insurance&mdash;shock, horror&mdash;is competition and an informed market. Those are principles which I would have thought the opposition would readily embrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly go through some of the points that have been raised in the course of the debate. On my own side, I think it is fair to say that, because of our strong commitment to the Medicare arrangements and the recognition of the complexity inherent in the health sector, we have had recognition of two fundamental points. Firstly, we have had the recognition that the primary role of a strong, vigorous public health system delivered by universal access is the one that we want to reinforce&mdash;not so as to diminish the private sector but to recognise that as the means by which Australians' health is protected. Secondly, we have recognised in the legislation benefits to consumers from an increased level of competition and reform in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that consumers have not known what they were purchasing. They have not been able to compare one product with another. They have not known how much they would be likely to have to meet out of pocket. They have not known what they were buying. This legislation informs them. I am very pleased indeed that the speeches given by those on my side have reflected a deep commitment to Medicare, an understanding of the importance of private health insurance and of the importance of both of these bills to improving the value for money to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to indicate that a number of the contributions made by those opposite conceded support for Medicare. Perhaps it was in the same spirit as the Fraser-Howard coalition dismantled it; nonetheless, it conceded support for it. A continued theme that emerges in contributions by the coalition speakers, however, is what I think is a naive conviction that private health participation rates is the major health issue in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues surrounding private health participation are critical&mdash;we would not have these bills here otherwise. But what we have heard over the last 10 months&mdash;certainly in my time as minister&mdash;is an obsession with this issue to the exclusion of many others. For example, how do you continue to fund the emerging demands in the public hospital system? How do you ensure decent relationships between the Commonwealth and the states to remove cost shifting? They are critical issues which are affecting waiting lists in our public hospitals far more severely than the issues surrounding private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that coalition speakers seem to have addressed is their characteristic embrace of regressive subsidies at the expense of universal access. I do not understand, as a minister on this side of the House, how Liberal-National Party politicians will so consistently focus on tax rebates, subsidies, breaks, industry support measures, when in other arenas they argue for the reduction and abolition of restrictive practices. Here we have them advocating precisely that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak briefly to the opposition amendments of the member for MacKellar. They were introduced as her last act in that capacity, and in that last act she accused me of&mdash;shock, horror&mdash;American proclivities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mrs Bishop interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Personal abuse is part of the member for MacKellar's style. It is the opposition that would have Australia blindly stumble into an American style health system. It is precisely opposition policies which do that. The opposition would develop a system without universal access. There would be one system for the rich and one for the poor, one for those who have and one for those who have not. There would be a system where private interests override public good&mdash;very clearly the case in the speech by the member for Mackellar&mdash;and where quality of care is a function of ability to pay. You get the best if you have got the money. That is precisely what we wish to avoid: an American system where 40 million people have no health cover at all. That is the system we inherited when we came to government in 1983. That is the system which, I am pleased to say, we destroyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, when I met with OECD countries and emerging economies in eastern Europe and the Third World, they very clearly recognised our system as being superior to that of the United States. The officials who were there at that meeting, who had just seen the Clinton amendments fail, were in despair because they did not know how they could possibly provide universal access to health care for their citizens without very significant amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address the amendments briefly, point by point. They are, in my view, very simplistic and shallow. I am pleased, at least, that the new shadow minister is proposing to move some more specific and carefully worded amendments in another place. Firstly, it is claimed that these reforms will not stop the decline in health insurance. Quite clearly, these reforms provide a framework for the industry to improve its efficiency and, in many cases, despite difficulty in doing so, there has already been significant negotiation of reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be an ability for the industry, for the first time, to develop products that people recognise as value for money. This will actually mean that people will know what they are buying; they can compare costs; and they will make sensible decisions. I cannot think of a better way to place pressure on producers than that. It is up to the industry, not taxpayers, to pull the customers back through the doors. That is the difference in our approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is said that these reforms restrict freedom of choice&mdash;quite to the contrary. The choice of products will be significantly enhanced because the insurers and the hospitals have a capacity to negotiate new agreements. If doctors do have contracts, people will be better off with either known or zero out-of-pocket costs. If that is not an improvement in freedom of choice, I do not know what is. So many people right at this moment do not know what they are likely to get by way of a bill until some weeks after they have been discharged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to default payments, both the current shadow minister and the former one said that we needed default payments, otherwise there would be unfair practices and the funds would refuse to deal with certain hospitals or doctors. That is very unlikely but, in any case, the Trade Practices Commission has powers to prevent that from occurring. There is no evidence and, when you think about it, no rationale to suggest that efficient, quality private hospitals of any size&mdash;large or small&mdash;will be adversely affected by the proposed contracting arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To set default payments at 50 per cent or some other level hardly meets the hospitals' costs; it is hardly going to be attractive to them. And, if the consumer has to meet the balance, how will that assist them in any way? It would be no more than a sop and it certainly would not be appealing to the funds, the doctors or, for that matter, to the hospitals. The discussions I have had with those of them who are thinking clearly recognise that the funds will not be able to avoid them. They have consumers who are saying, `I want to go to my neighbourhood hospital; I want to go to my regional hospital. I want to negotiate with these doctors. If you do not have a package with them, I will go somewhere else.' That is precisely the way in which this industry should operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current shadow minister, also in relation to this particular element, indicated that small insurance funds would have difficulty in negotiating with large hospitals. The fact is that they are already acting in concert. They have set up various arrangements whereby they will not act as a single institution or a single organisation; they will be working very closely with one another to ensure that they get a good deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to these amendments, I turn to community rating. What is outlined in these amendments is absolutely wrong. By law, the funds have to offer a product which covers all episodes of hospital treatment. That is what the legislation requires. So they cannot get around community rating. If, for some reason, their product deviates from that, we have 60 days in advance of the product being marketed. That is what the bill requires. They have to notify us in advance so we can assess it and see whether it violates the principles of community rating. The department will examine these products and ensure that they do not. At the moment, we do not have the capacity; we have to act after the fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the amendments suggest that there is no specific appeal mechanism. At this stage, the complaints go to a commissioner who essentially has a conciliatory and recommendatory role. The commissioner is not arbitrating. We have indicated that in future we may wish to do that, and at that point it will obviously be appropriate to introduce appeal mechanisms. In the meantime, these are essentially contracts between hospitals and insurance funds, hospitals and doctors, and doctors and insurance funds, and they can be dealt with appropriately under the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments state that the bill grants the minister excessive power. I have to say that the so-called power is no different from that which exists in the current arrangements, and the applicable benefit arrangements are not ones in which the minister is involved. The amendment is simply wrong on that score. The applicable benefit arrangements are between the parties concerned. The minister has no power to intervene, nor is it sought in the legislation. The health funds will be appropriately oversighted to protect the individual contributors to such funds. That can hardly be seen as excessive ministerial power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the privacy questions, why would it be better to put it in the hands of an independent body or, as the honourable member for Mackellar said in her speech, a private commercial body? I think that would be the worst possible arrangement. We have had extensive consultations with the Privacy Commissioner regarding these reforms, and all of the comments the Privacy Commissioner has made have been appropriately taken into account in the structure of these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the principles of this legislation are to focus on consumer rights and increase the level of competition&mdash;principles that I thought would have been embraced by the opposition. In doing that, we want to provide value for money for private health insurance and a wider choice of products. These objectives can be achieved by enabling health funds to make contracts with hospitals and doctors&mdash;realistic ones, not ones based on some phoney constraints. We also want to ensure efficiency measures and equitable access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the policy of the bill and the opposition's response clearly highlight the differences between Labor government practice and coalition rhetoric. Look at the key words: `consumer rights', `competition', `value for money', `equity', `access' and `choice'. In 12 years of government, we have been taking action, implementing and reforming. For 20 years the coalition has been talking, vacillating and shifting ground&mdash;both when in opposition and in those years of lost opportunity when the now recycled Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years the income tax law has been criticised for being too difficult to read and understand. This difficulty has led to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">unnecessarily high compliance costs for taxpayers;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">increased administration costs for government; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">inaccurate compliance by taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA>In November 1993, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended the setting up of a broadly based Task Force to rewrite the income tax law. The following month, the former Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, announced the tax law improvement project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project's goals are to reduce compliance costs and to improve compliance by restructuring and rewriting Australia's income tax law so that it is more easily understood. The project is not a policy review, but it will provide opportunities to remove unnecessary complexity and cost from the administrative requirements of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project team includes personnel from the Australian Taxation Office, the Treasury and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. In addition, I have appointed two private sector  representatives to the project's leadership, as well as setting up a 14-person consultative committee drawn exclusively from outside the government sector. The project will run for three years from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Substantiation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994 is the first new law to be brought forward by the project team. Early in the life of the project, the team identified the need to rewrite part of the existing law as a possible legislative model that could be publicly tested and assessed through processes of consultation. The substantiation provisions were chosen because they affect seven out of 10 taxpayers. These provisions set out the rules to be followed in claiming deductions for work related expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I released an exposure draft bill in August of last year, and over 3,500 copies were distributed. As well, the members of the project held well-attended seminars around Australia to discuss the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, feedback from the consultation process was very positive. It indicated that the redraft was much easier to understand and could be expected to lead to a significantly greater use of the tax law itself as a source of information for tax practitioners and others who need to understand the law. More importantly, most people who took part thought the proposed changes would reduce their compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What the Bill does</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes improvements to the substantiation provisions of the law that may be considered in three parts. They are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a clear, helpful structure and layout;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">plain language in a personable style;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">cutting back administrative requirements that are unnecessarily complex or out of touch with current commercial reality or normal behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Changes to structure</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill significantly changes the structure and order in which the substantiation law is presented, so that the important requirements of the law are more easily found. One of the innovations of the bill is the use of highlighted key principles at the start of each major segment of the bill. These give readers a simple entry point. As well the bill makes extensive use of navigational aids to identify, and guide readers to, those provisions relevant to them. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Changes to language</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing law has been completely rewritten in clear, everyday language that tries to anticipate the needs of its readers. To make readers more comfortable in following the law, the bill introduces another innovation by addressing the reader personally throughout as `you', using a tone that is essentially friendly and not bureaucratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greater use is made within the text of examples and notes to provisions. The bill is shorter, clearer, simpler and more readable than the present law. Overall, the legislation has been reduced by almost half. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Changes to administrative requirements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to make the procedural rules less cumbersome, the main changes proposed by this bill are as follows. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">The existing log book rules for calculating car expenses are so complicated that few taxpayers fully understand them. The greatest complexity is in working out what percentage of your car expenses you can deduct. The bill will greatly simplify this calculation and reduce the occasions when a new log book must be kept. This is one area of the bill where the approach taken in the exposure draft bill has been further improved as a result of the extensive consultation process. </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">Access to the `cents per kilometre' method of calculating car deductions will be extended so that more taxpayers can use it. The cents per kilometre method is the most often used of the four methods available for calculating car expense deductions. Currently, it cannot be used at all if business travel is more than the 5,000 kilometres in a year. That restriction will be eased so that claims up to 5,000 kilometres can be based on this method even if business kilometres are more than this. The maximum claim remains unchanged at 5,000 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA>Record keeping requirements will be eased in several ways. For example:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">taxpayers will be able to claim up to $150 worth of deductible home laundry expenses without needing to keep receipts. This commonsense change has been particularly well received in the community;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">taxpayers will no longer be required to go to the trouble of signing every entry in a logbook or travel diary;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">in recognition of practical realities, taxpayers will be able to annotate receipts from suppliers if they contain insufficient information to identify the goods or services supplied. </PARA>
<PARA>The exception from substantiation for taxpayers who claim no more than $300 of work and car expenses will be effectively widened by excluding car expenses from the limit. Most taxpayers with car expenses usually have such large claims that they are unable to benefit from the exception, even though their other work expenses may total less than $300. By excluding car expenses, these taxpayers will not have to substantiate their other work expenses within the $300 limit. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Date of effect</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that the benefit of improvements, including simpler administrative requirements, can be available to taxpayers in the current income year, the changes will apply to expenses incurred from 1 July 1994. A special saving provision will apply for the 1994-95 income year to ensure that nobody can be detrimentally affected by any of the changes. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Revenue Impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of the proposed changes result in a gain to the revenue. Overall, the changes may result in a cost to revenue of about $2 million to $5 million per annum. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Tax Law Improvement (Substantiation) Bill 1994 was introduced into the House on 8 December last year. As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has pointed out, the bill sets out to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Whilst coalition members support and welcome the work put into this proposed legislation, we have some reservations and criticisms that I will enumerate later. They should not be taken in any way to detract from our support for the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the criticisms, I suggest, will be constructive, although there will be some of a more general nature. The bill completely rewrites the substantiation rules for deductions for work, business, travel and car expenses incurred on or after 1 July 1994. The changes were not formally announced but the bill was preceded by an exposure draft in August 1994 which was subject to extensive consultation, as the minister has pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft was titled `Tax law improvement project paper substantiation&mdash;Exposure draft No. 1 August 1994'. Over 200 submissions and questionnaires were received by the project team which worked on the draft bill. Many of the issues raised in those submissions have been addressed. The changes to substantiation are largely the same as those in the draft, although actual provisions have been renumbered, and in some cases reformatted and relocated. With the exception of certain items such as laundry expenses, the provisions in the bill actually reflect existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is approximately half the size of existing substantiation legislation encompassed in present sections 82KT to 82KZBB inclusive. Two schedules, schedule 2A calculating car expenses and schedule 2B substantiation, are to be inserted in the Income Tax Assessment Act but do not repeal the existing substantiation provisions. Instead, they will remain as schedules until they can be transferred into a new income tax law framework which, we are advised, is currently being developed. In addition, there are a number of consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, income tax regulations, and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act following the restructuring, rewriting and renumbering of the substantiation provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill adopts a plain English style, including the use of the personal pronoun `you' to refer to taxpayers. There is also a new numbering system which has been designed to avoid current numbering problems. The bill also makes it clear that the substantiation provisions apply to individuals&mdash;not including trustees&mdash;and partnerships, including a natural person. The position with the application of substantiation requirements to partnerships has not been clear under existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is the first product of the tax law improvement project. The tax law improvement project was announced by the government in December 1993 with the object of rewriting the income tax law in simple language. The project started on 1 July 1994 and is expected to take three years to complete the task. The project has a consultative committee of 14 members made up of representatives of accounting and legal firms, the Australian Society of Chartered Practising Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Corporate Tax Association, the National Farmers Federation and the Taxation Institute of Australia. Also, there are two private sector representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement followed a recommendation by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts made in November 1993 that the government establish a broadly based task force to redraft the principal act. The project has also released a broad framework. It makes clear that the project is not about reforming the tax system or reviewing tax policy. It will focus on administrative rules that are overly complex, unnecessary or out of date with today's reality. However, the framework made clear that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When redrafting, the project team may come across provisions where the meaning is unclear. Those cases may require the Government to clarify the policy, so the law can be more clearly written.</PARA>
<PARA>The new rules are designed to be shorter, clearer, simpler and more readable than is the present law. This is to be achieved by restructuring, renumbering and rewriting the legislation as has already been indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim is to reduce compliance costs by rewriting the principal act and other tax laws so that it is easier to understand&mdash;an aim, I am afraid to say, on this first example which will only be partially successful. At the current pace at which the project team is working, the objectives cannot be met until early next century, although I personally would hope that there is some improvement on that possible timetable. The project team has indicated that it is also looking at depreciation, research and development, and primary production losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major shortcoming with this whole exercise has been the narrowness of the review. Complex tax policy issues which need to be addressed to achieve any major simplification of the tax system have been totally ignored in this bill with the emphasis of this project resting 100 per cent on using plain English and adopting a simple legislative structure. This is to be commended but, as I will go on to outline, it goes nowhere near far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the new substantiation provisions will apply to expenses incurred on or after 1 July 1994. This contrasts with the exposure draft which provided for a 1 July 1995 starting date. The existing law will apply only to expenses incurred before 1 July 1994, obviously. However, a special provision is included so that in the 1994-95 income year, if the new law would deny a deduction allowable under the existing law or allow a lesser deduction than under the existing law, a taxpayer can nevertheless claim the amount allowable under the old law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantiation provisions affect seven out of 10 taxpayers. The number of people estimated to be affected is 5.4 million taxpayers. As the Assistant Treasurer pointed out, the financial impact of this bill will be minimal. Most of the administrative changes will have no impact on the revenue, with the exception of the removal of car expenses from the $300 substantiation threshold exemption, which will cost up to $10 million per annum, I understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most measures should reduce compliance costs but there will be some increase in compliance costs for individual business persons who undertake short-term domestic travel over a period of one to five nights inclusive. Presently, they are not required to maintain any records but the bill requires that they obtain written evidence. Also the compliance costs to salary and wage earners will increase for those who must now retain records for five years instead of 3 1/2 years and they will be disadvantaged and incur additional costs, presumably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main substantive changes proposed to make the substantiation rules less cumbersome are as follows: for car expenses, logbook rules are now less complex or will be under this legislation. This development is welcome, although the complex requirement to maintain a logbook remains the same. Taxpayers can base their business use percentage on a reasonable estimate of the number of kilometres the car travels during the year in the course of producing assessable income. But taxpayers must keep a new logbook for a stipulated period every five years to establish the basis of allowable expenditure in subsequent years. This reduces the number of situations in which a new logbook must be kept and that is to taxpayers' advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Car expenses will now be calculated by the cents per kilometre method. The application of this method of calculating car expense deductions will be extended so that taxpayers who travel more than 5,000 business kilometres may claim for 5,000 kilometres. However, car expenses will now be exempt from the scope of the $300 substantiation-free concession. This change has occurred because in the past, when car expenses were significant, the $300 limit was easily exceeded, with the result that both work and car expenses had to be substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantiation requirements for travel expenses are to be standardised by removing the need for taxpayers to keep a diary for short-term overseas travel and requiring business taxpayers to get written evidence of expenses incurred during short-term domestic travel. In future, taxpayers will be able to claim up to $150 for deductible laundry expenses without providing receipts. Existing law requires taxpayers to substantiate all laundry expenses, and we know what a nonsense that proved to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires taxpayers to keep records for five years. This will reduce the period which business taxpayers must keep records by a period of two years, but increase it for salary and wage earners by some 18 months. This change will, no doubt, require taxpayers to take greater care in keeping records. I hope and trust they become aware of that obligation and the extended period for which they must maintain those records. Taxpayers, generally, are not good at record maintenance procedures and are more likely to either misplace, lose or unintentionally dispose of the required substantiation receipts within a period of five years or even less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new rules, taxpayers are required to obtain written evidence for allowable expenditure in three different categories. The first of these is for work expenses. The second is for domestic and overseas business travel expenses for which a travel diary must be kept if a person is away from his or her ordinary residence for six or more nights in a row. Similarly, the third category is for car expenses other than fuel and oil expenses if the taxpayer uses the one-third of actual expenses method or the logbook method to calculate car expenses. Odometer records must be kept for car expenses if the one-third of actual expenses method is used, the expenses are for fuel and oil, and the taxpayer does not get written evidence of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Substantiation is not now required for some six or seven categories of allowable expenditure. The first is work expenses of $300 or less, including laundry expenses, but not travel or meal allowance expenses or expenses covered by an award transport payment. The second category that does not require substantiation, as has already been mentioned, is laundry expenses of $150 or less. The third category not requiring substantiation involves expenses on motor vehicles that are not cars&mdash;for example, a motorcycle&mdash;or are not owned or leased&mdash;for example, a borrowed car&mdash;unless it is a taxi fare or similar expense or an expense incurred in travel outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Substantiation in the fourth category covers expenses by an award transport payment&mdash;that is, transport payment covering travel paid under an industrial instrument in force at 29 October 1986&mdash;if the taxpayer claims less than the amount payable on 29 October 1986. The fifth category includes overtime meal allowance expenses covered by an allowance payable under an Australian law. If the commissioner considers the amount the taxpayer claims to be reasonable, the expense will not have to be substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth category is expenses covered by travel allowance. If the commissioner considers the amount the taxpayer claims is reasonable, having regard to expenses it would be reasonable to incur for travel within Australia, the expenses will not have to be substantiated on accommodation, food, drink or incidental travel expenses or, if overseas, on food, drink or incidental travel expenses. In that case, taxpayers must still keep travel records. Travel records, however, are not needed for travel allowance expenses covered by, and not more than, a travel allowance for travel principally overseas if the expenses are incurred by an aircraft crew member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following written evidence will be required for depreciation expenses. Taxpayers must obtain written evidence in the form of a document from the supplier of the property which sets out the name of the supplier, the cost of the property to the taxpayer, the nature of the property, the day the taxpayer acquired the property and the date of the document. Written evidence for expenses other than depreciation must be obtained from the supplier of the goods or services setting out the name of the supplier, the amount of the expense in the currency incurred, the nature of the goods or services, the day the expense was incurred and the date of the document. If a document from a supplier does not show the nature of the property, goods or services, then the taxpayers can add that information themselves. If the supplier's document does not show the day the expense was incurred, then a taxpayer can use a bank statement or other reasonable independent evidence to show that it was paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather onerous on the part of the Australian Taxation Office to expect taxpayers, every time they purchase goods and services, to check that the receipt they have obtained contains all the required information. If the receipt is lacking the required information, the taxpayer will have to fill in the missing gaps before lodging a tax return. This occurs in an environment where no supplier of goods and services is legally compelled under any state or federal law to actually provide an original receipt, invoice or statement in such a format. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost every receipt received by a taxpayer would fail to record the statutory requirements now to be imposed by those provisions. A taxpayer can make his or her own record of expenses instead of getting a document from a supplier if each expense to be deducted is $10 or less, all of them total $200 or less, or the commissioner considers it unreasonable to expect a taxpayer to get a document from the supplier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxpayer should, however, record in a diary, or similar document, details of activities undertaken during travel in the course of producing assessable income. If this is not done, the activities cannot be taken into account in apportioning travel expenses. The details in such a case to be recorded are: the nature of the travel activity, the day and approximate time it began, how long it lasted and where the taxpayer engaged in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A complete copy can substitute for original documents which are lost or destroyed. If the commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer took reasonable precautions to prevent the loss or destruction, the deduction is not affected if the document was not written evidence. If the document was written evidence, the taxpayer must try to get a substitute document with the same information. If it is not reasonably possible to do that, then the deduction is not affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this bill the government has missed the opportunity to simplify complex tax policy, which is what taxpayers and businesses really need. Those examples of requirements still in force illustrate that point. The tax law improvement project is only about using plain English and a simpler and easier to follow legislative structure&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. Most of the changes in the current substantiation requirements are not significant enough. While they are important, such as the removal of requirements, including the signing of every entry in a logbook and keeping records for laundry expenses, the process must go further. Having a look at the clock, it might suit the convenience of the House if I interrupted my remarks again. </PARA>

It gives me great pleasure tonight to pay tribute in that same way to a person whom I can only describe as being one of the finest Australians, but a person most members of this House would not know. As he believed in and respected the institution of parliament&mdash;although he did not always agree with it&mdash;I believe it is a worthy tribute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Henry Darwen died on 21 October 1994. On that day Australia lost a fine Australian. At the same time, the town of Bowen in North Queensland lost probably one of its most dedicated sons and citizens. There are few people to whom one can attribute as many positive initiatives in their lives as one can to Henry Darwen in his 81 years. He was born in 1913 and in his 81 years not only served his country and community but was a great example for what he contributed to his family and community. Few have been respected in the way he was. He used his 81 years to advance his community, to defend his country in war and also to defend Bowen in peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was born in Bowen and his father was the editor and publisher of the local paper and was mayor for a term of three years. I believe this set a pattern for the contribution he was later to make. He went into the publishing business at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bowen Independent</EMPHASIS> very early in 1929 and served on that paper until it was sold to a conglomerate in 1985. He took great pride in the fact that, at the time of the sale, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bowen Independent</EMPHASIS> was one of the only two purely family independent papers in Queensland. As a publisher, he used his efforts at all times to promote the community and the development in Bowen, his home town. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bowen people are very restrictive in their views of history. They believe that Bowen instead of Townsville should have been the port for Mount Isa. There is also the age factor. Bowen was one of the first communities settled in North Queensland&mdash;if not the first&mdash;and is positioned on one of the great natural harbours. Despite that, Townsville won the contract to be the outlet for Mount Isa. Notwithstanding that, Henry Darwen did everything he could to promote Bowen. In the time of Dr Peter Delamothe's membership of the state parliament, Mr Darwen assisted him in all ways that would give further recognition to Bowen. He served on the local council as the deputy mayor and was always prepared to jump in and do the things that were required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year where Australia remembers its activities during the Second World War, it is fitting to comment that he served his country. He joined the CMF as a member of the Bowen Detachment in 1936; was active in service between 1941 and 1945; and served in Cape York, Dutch New Guinea and Northern New Guinea and was discharged as a sergeant. In both peace and war, in all of his activities he was able to maintain a sense of direction with his family and within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a member of the Anglican Church and assisted it in every way he could. He was also the chairman of the Bowen Harbour Board, with the firm belief still that Bowen should have been the port for North Queensland instead of Townsville, and he did everything he could to further that view. He was awarded an OBE in 1975 for his achievements in public life of remarkable standard and diversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to know that Henry Darwen in life is no more.

They evaporated once we won the bid and the realisation came that somewhere in the order of $700,000 to stage the event would be focused on my electorate and that it was estimated that towns along the route would earn in the vicinity of $30,000 a night when the participants went through those villages and townships.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the misguided decision by federal cabinet in 1945 to develop Kingsford-Smith as an international airport there has been endless controversy. Even in the 1940s it was obviously an unsuitable site, on any unbiased view. For 50 years almost all decision making has been short term and driven by vested interests. It was not until 1980 that the reality was officially recognised in the Sydney region outline plan review as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present location of the airport (Kingsford-Smith) is inappropriate for a city the size of Sydney: the site is too small, expansion would adversely affect the bay, the port and the surrounding community. Three out of four approach paths to the airport are over dense urban development giving rise to real concern over safety, and the road traffic to serve the airport is causing increasing congestion on the local road system. There is no doubt that a major airport located on a green fields site and connected to inner Sydney by high standard road and rail links is the only solution to catering for Sydney's future airport needs.</PARA>
<PARA>That analysis was first made in the 1940s. In 1995 it is now accepted by every thinking person except the vested interests.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet over the years captive governments and bureaucracies have poured billions of dollars in public subsidies into Kingsford-Smith. Beginning from an area about the size of two football fields, the airport has steadily gobbled up a large part of Sydney. First Ascot racecourse went, then the New Brighton and Bonnie Doon golf courses. Cooks River was moved, two or three lakes filled, a substantial part of Botany Bay taken and a railway line removed. Huge surrounding areas have been taken by airport related infrastructure. Thousands of homes have been demolished. Now hundreds more will be demolished at Sydenham, and thousands more along the flight paths and land transport routes will slowly decay and cease to be livable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the single biggest cause of urban sprawl in the metropolitan area except, of course, for the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority. The airport and its adjoining infrastructure are now occupying land on which some 200,000 people could be living at relatively low densities. The fact that 200,000 are instead living on the urban fringe has imposed massive urban consolidation costs on the community&mdash;costs which make those of a new airport almost insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all this, we have a third rate airport with split passenger terminals, on a minuscule site which cannot even cope with the Olympics and has no long-term future. It suffers enormous air traffic congestion and a permanent curfew. Airline competition is stifled by the outrageous 30-year domestic terminal leases to Ansett and Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a massive health hazard to both passengers and residents alike, located as it is adjoining the Sydney CBD, with the runways aligned with Australia's highest density residential area and a major petro-chemical works: the whole miasma stirred along by the self-serving Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;soon to be disbanded&mdash;and the Civil Aviation Authority, a shattered and discredited organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present major health studies being conducted will underline not only the deleterious effects of aircraft noise but the toxic effects of aircraft emissions. In addition, residential areas in inner and middle Sydney are being forced to increase residential densities in a futile attempt to make up for the residential land inexorably lost to the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On any rational basis&mdash;economic, social or environmental&mdash;it is impossible to keep an expanding international airport in the densest part of Sydney. All that can be done in the short term is: firstly, to implement a range of noise minimisation procedures&mdash;not on the inhuman political basis of apportioning as much noise as possible to those in the state and federal seats on the northern flight path, but on the basis of equity; and, secondly, to accelerate the construction of Badgerys Creek as a replacement airport for Kingsford-Smith by, say, 2005. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A twin airport solution is hopeless and the proposal of long-term leasing of Kingsford-Smith to private enterprise would entrench this and all the other problems with no solution possible. It would be uneconomic and inefficient and preclude the massive economic, social and environmental benefits of redeveloping Kingsford-Smith residentially. It is almost beyond belief that in half a century of airport development no cost benefit study has been prepared for this or for the effect on Sydney of any of the major works carried out at the airport. </PARA>

<PARA>Following my question to the Deputy Prime Minister this week, I find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday 7 February, in a report entitled `Snag over housing cash' the following comment from the East Perth Redevelopment Authority Chief Executive Michael Ratcliffe:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the authority&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was still negotiating with private companies and could not release the plan until those talks had finished later this year.</PARA>
<PARA>So what do I have, Mr Speaker? On 23 January this year I have a comprehensive plan that is in existence; on 31 of January the release of that plan is imminent; and on 7 February that plan is not yet complete and will be released later this year. That tells me a couple of things. It tells me, firstly, that the East Perth Redevelopment Authority is acting under instructions from the state government to drag its feet on affordable housing and not to fulfil its affordable housing commitments; secondly, it tells me that there is no commitment on the part of the state government for affordable housing in East Perth; and, thirdly, it tells me that, unless the state government is relentlessly pursued on this matter, East Perth will become a enclave for the rich and not provide for any reasonable amount of affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people in this business are publicly spirited. I have now in my possession a copy of `East Perth Redevelopment Authority&mdash;Affordable Housing in East Perth: A position summary', which was released privately to me because the state government refused to do so. This is an East Perth Redevelopment Authority plan which provides for an `active program of assisted housing which will provide 50 residential units to low and moderate income households in East Perth'. This position paper argues that, because 50 affordable housing units will be erected in the first three years, in accordance with the better cities program, this will result in a rich social mix and `advanced equity and social justice'. `Rich' is the right word. With 50 units out of a $100 million project, it is for the rich. As I have previously, I call upon the state government to release its comprehensive plans now. It cannot get away with this sleight of hand&mdash;to use $100 million worth of taxpayers' funds to provide only 50 affordable housing units in East Perth. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, having been identified by Coopers and Lybrand as the third fastest growing area in Australia, the former city of Cranbourne, now part of the city of Casey, has many urgent needs. Some of these are being addressed. I am pleased to say, for instance, that some cooperation between the federal and state governments will see the extension of electric train services to Cranbourne by an expected date of late March this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Cranbourne still lacks a Medicare office. Residents with cash or cheque claims for Medicare, Medibank Private or the new child-care allowance have to travel to the nearest Medicare office at either Parkmore, Keysborough, Frankston or Dandenong. Cranbourne businesses also lose possible takings since the location of a Medicare office can be an important factor in where residents spend their shopping dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Health Insurance Commission will immediately say, `We have no spare cash to lease and fit out a new office, or to run it with the minimum six staff that we run metropolitan offices with.' May I suggest that, with the Dandenong and Frankston offices both handling in excess of 1,000 claims on many days&mdash;the latter having particular difficulties in coping with workloads&mdash;any future growth at either of these offices will almost certainly require new office accommodation. Rentals in Cranbourne will typically be cheaper than in Dandenong or Frankston. I agree with the Health Insurance Commission that any new offices must be affordable. Surely, if it can save thousands of dollars through not having to expand in these district centres, that should be a major stumbling block cleared in obtaining the go-ahead for a Cranbourne office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proportion of bulk-billing&mdash;or, as the commission calls it, direct billing&mdash;of patients by medical practitioners is now at a statewide average of almost 60 per cent, but for Cranbourne it is only 45 per cent. It certainly is not correct to assume that all doctors bulk-bill in the outer suburbs. This means that there would most likely be a greater than average number of cash claims at any new Cranbourne office for each 1,000 client visits, at least on the Medicare side of the office's operations&mdash;and Medicare typically accounts for 50 to 60 per cent of an office's workload. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cranbourne has about 10,000 children under the age of five. With about five families moving into the area on a daily basis, it is easy to see that figure rapidly growing. Since many parents will now be claiming the home child-care allowance through Medicare offices, the high percentage of young people in the Cranbourne community further shows the urgent need for a Medicare office in Cranbourne. People from Phillip Island and Wonthaggi presently have to travel to Dandenong to lodge their claims. Not only would their travelling time be reduced but they could also shop in Cranbourne and bring further shopping dollars to Cranbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the Health Insurance Commission opened a new office at Waurn Ponds last year after many years of pressure from my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) for a facility on the southern side of the Barwon River. I commend my colleague for his efforts. However, while I think we all recognise that area around Geelong to be fast growing, it is outstripped by the rate at which Cranbourne is expanding. If Waurn Ponds can be the recipient of a new office, why not Cranbourne?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to continue pressing this Labor government for a new Medicare office in Cranbourne. The local community urgently needs this facility. Its provision would reduce likely future expenditures elsewhere by the Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that, at this late hour in the adjournment debate when members try to get out information often relevant to their electorates, it is a little galling to have this simpering saurian from Mackellar interrupt the debate. I was making the point that the Australian Prospectors and Miners Hall of Fame Committee is doing a great job in promoting the establishment of this facility in the Goldfields. Three sites have been proposed&mdash;in Ora Banda, in Coolgardie and in Kalgoorlie itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is modelled, of course, on the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach, and it is designed to give the public at large an insight into all aspects of the mining industry, from prospecting to mining. A repository will be formed. I might use the words of Kris Laurie, the project consultant. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objects are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. To establish a Public Museum, Art Gallery and Mining Heritage Precinct to act as a repository for historic records, artefacts and equipment of National significance relating to Prospecting and Mining activities; together with a recognition of the people and stories behind the material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. To develop the facility as a centre for learning about prospecting and mining in Australia and the relationship with society, the economy and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. To acquire and maintain a collection of fine art that adequately reflects and represents the concepts for which the APMHF was established.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not, however, just a museum. The plan of the committee is to have an ongoing facility which is being continually added to. As progress develops in the mining industry, new exhibits will be installed. It is planned to have a facility which is very much interactive. In the tourist mine in the Goldfields, we already have excellent examples of how well interactive facilities can relate to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a lot more to say but, as I said, I was stopped by the petulant actions of the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop). I do want to commend the work of this committee. I think its members have been far-sighted; certainly, they have been very diligent in their work. I believe that the Goldfields and the whole of Australia should wish them every success. I hope that we will not see, however, a situation arise where competing facilities are set up, for it was their original idea and I think they should be applauded for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate to make a few remarks to honour Australia's prawn industry. The coalition supports and welcomes the Prawn Boat Levy Bill, the 1994 Prawn Export Charge Bill 1994 and Prawn Export Promotion Bill, which are being debated in cognate. The Australian Prawn Promotion Association Limited, which has now existed for four years, has dedicated itself to attempting to arrest the decline in Australia's prawn market share and earnings through direct competition in overseas markets from aquacultured prawns. It is an industry that earns some $179 million a year in export income. Given the current rather precarious state of this nation's balance of trade position, it is entirely appropriate that industries be encouraged to do everything possible to address that situation. That is precisely what the Australian Prawn Promotion Association Ltd is attempting to do with this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with difficulties in the industry, the association sought federal government assistance in working to increase the export value of sea caught prawns, particularly in the very important market of Asia, especially Japan. The association has developed what amounts to a self-help strategy and will seek to promote its product in innovative ways which will broadly seek to differentiate Australian sea caught prawns from the overseas farmed product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to collect funds for the scheme by means of a prawn boat levy and prawn export charge. The following groups have essentially sought and agreed to this approach: the National Fishing Industry Council, Queensland Commercial Fishermen's Organisation, Western Australian Northern Trawler Operators Association, Western Australian Fishing Industry Council, Australian Fisheries Management Authority, Spencer Gulf Association of South Australia, Sharks Bay Association of Western Australia and Northern Prawn Fisheries Queensland Trawl Association. Essentially, given that the government has agreed to collect these funds from the industry, the money collected by the Commonwealth will be paid to the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation which will use those funds specifically for the promotion of sea caught prawns or the product thereof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All promotional activities must be approved by the Australian Prawn Promotion Association Ltd acting on behalf of its members. The amount of levy will be determined by the Australian Prawn Promotion Association Ltd and prescribed by regulation. However, the maximum permissible amount of levy per boat is $75 for a ship less than 10 metres, $150 for a ship more than 10 metres but less than 15 metres, $300 for a ship more than 15 metres but less than 18 metres and $750 in the case of a ship not less than 18 metres. The amount of the export charge is not to exceed 10c a kilogram of the net weight of the sea caught prawns. There will be an exemption for exporters who export less than 5,000 kilograms of sea caught prawns or their product in a financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other comment that I would make is to acknowledge that from time to time the debate is raised as to the appropriateness of industries determining that they want to impose levies on themselves and that, in return for government assistance and contribution towards these schemes, they would bind all of their members&mdash;notwithstanding that some members may have different views. That sometimes is seen to be a difficult issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say this very clearly: the evidence is quite overwhelming that, where these schemes are properly constructed and where due processes in relation to accountability are maintained, the benefits both to the industry participants and to Australia's economic performance, and in particular to its trade performance, are a substantial improvement on what they might otherwise have been. The nation has, in my view, benefited enormously&mdash;particularly in terms of export returns&mdash;from, for instance, the research and development grant arrangements that apply to virtually all of our primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These approaches to date have enjoyed bipartisan support in this place&mdash;in recognition, as I say, of their benefit not only to the participants but to the broader community and to Australia's economic performance in general. I hope that that continues to be the case in the future. I do not want to prolong the debate here more than anybody else does; but, given that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) felt no particular need this morning to elaborate in great detail on this legislation, I thought it appropriate to make those comments. We support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In light of the fact that there is a vigorous debate getting under way, it might help the committee if I were to give some greater details as to the government's intentions in introducing this legislation. The purpose of Prawn Boat Levy Bill 1994, Prawn Export Charge Bill 1994 and the Prawn Export Promotion Bill 1994&mdash;which, of course, we are dealing with as a cognate debate&mdash;is to provide funding for the export promotion of Australian sea caught prawns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prawn sector is an important part of the Australian fishing industry, providing significant input to a number of regional economies. In 1992-93, prawn exports totalled $260 million, which is nearly 20 per cent of the total Australian fishing industry GVP. Some 10,000 tonnes of sea caught prawns are exported annually. Over the past few years, market share and earnings have been reduced through direct competition in overseas markets, mainly from aquaculture prawns being produced in Asian countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prices have fluctuated dramatically over the last six years and this has affected all sectors of the industry. All major Australian prawn fisheries are being fished to full capacity and are being carefully managed by state and Commonwealth authorities to ensure sustainability for the industry. Increased catches to counteract falling prices are just not possible. Faced with these pressures, the prawn fishing industry recognised the benefits of developing a structured and coordinated approach to market development. Through the Australian Prawn Promotion Association (APPA), the industry is working to increase the export value of Australian sea caught prawns, especially those sold on the Japanese market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry developed a promotional strategy to contrast Australian sea caught prawns with the Asian farmed product. The strategy aims to make the public aware of the excellent quality of Australian sea caught prawns taken from clean, unpolluted seas. It will also stress specific attributes such as size, flavour and health status. This is a great example of an industry working together to best promote its product in a very competitive market. The promotion plan will be complemented with action in other important areas such as value adding, product quality, freight cost minimisation and reliability of supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following development of the proposal over several years, the vast majority of the Australian prawn industry has called for a compulsory levy on its members to promote its products in export markets, particularly in Japan. APPA has tried introducing voluntary levies, but these did not work, due to a large number of free-riders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government support in collecting a levy is not unique to the prawn industry. Within the primary industries and energy portfolio, some 30 compulsory levies or charges are collected by the government to fund promotion and other activities to assist primary industries. Compulsory levies will allow for greater accountability over the use of funds, and ensure that those gaining the greatest benefit from the promotion will make the largest contribution. Given the very strong industry support for the promotion scheme and its funding through a levy, the government was pleased to agree to the industry's request to introduce legislation for a compulsory levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prawn boat levy and the prawn export charge are the two mechanisms by which contributions will be collected. To support APPA in the responsible management of public funds, the Commonwealth's Fisheries Research and Development Corporation will oversight the management and disbursement of the funds collected. APPA will bear the responsibility for determining the promotional activities and the day-to-day running of the scheme. APPA will also provide the FRDC with strategic annual operational plans and annual reports about prawn promotion. These will form a segment of any FRDC reporting requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is pleased to allow APPA to be the main player in running the promotion program. The government views this as an important industry initiative, and considers it will prove an important example to other sectors of the fishing industry which are wanting to promote their products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three bills in this package of legislation. The Prawn Export Promotion Bill will provide the administrative framework for collecting, managing and disbursing the prawn promotion funds. The collection arrangements closely mirror those that appear in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. This new bill adapts the essential features of the PILCC Act 1991 for the collection of both the prawn export charge and the prawn boat levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the provisions of this bill will give the secretary to the department the power to conclude an agency agreement with APPA, making it the collecting organisation for the boat levy and the export charge, thus reducing the administrative costs of the scheme. The bills provide for the imposition of two separate types of levies. One levy will apply to boats taking prawns for the export market, and the other will apply to exporters of sea caught prawns and parts of sea caught prawns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For both the Prawn Boat Export Levy Bill and the Prawn Export Charge Bill, the government has taken account of the user-pays principle by targeting only that sector of the prawn fishing industry that catches prawns for the export markets. Boats that would normally take prawns only for the domestic market are exempt from the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy will be payable by the owner of any boat that is licensed to be used to take prawns and is a registered establishment under the Export Control Act 1982. The rate of levy is to be set by regulation, being initially between $50 and $500 per boat per annum, depending on the length of the boat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four categories of boat length levies. A boat less than 10 metres will attract $50; a boat 10 metres but less than 15 metres will attract $100; a boat 15 metres but less than 18 metres will attract $200; and a boat over 18 metres will attract $500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides for a maximum levy rate 50 per cent higher than each of the rates set out above. Pro rata rates of levy will be prescribed in the first year of operation of the act if the act comes into effect part way through a financial year. It is expected that the boat levy will raise some $300,000 during the first full year of its operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prawn Export Charge Bill proposes that all sea caught prawns, parts of sea caught prawns and sea caught prawn components of products which are exported from Australia be subject to a charge for the funding of the export promotion program. The charge will be paid by the exporter, and will be initially set at 2c per kilogram. Only by industry's recommendation can the rate of the charge be raised by regulation to a maximum of 10c per kilogram. This levy is expected to raise some $200,000 for promotion in the first full year of operation. It is important to note that levy rates for boat lengths and export charges can only be raised following an APPA annual general meeting at which approval is given by members to the new rates of levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members can see that this is valuable and important legislation, and the mere fact that it has been dealt with in this committee in no way indicates that it is anything but a most important piece of legislation. I commend it to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to talk on this very significant piece of legislation. It does affect my electorate, where the prawn industry is a very important one. The Prawn Export Promotion Bill 1994, together with the Prawn Boat Levy Bill 1994 and the Prawn Export Charge Bill 1994, give effect to an announcement on 13 July by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) aimed at boosting the promotion of Australia's sea caught prawn exports. This initiative is designed to combat the erosion of the Australian prawn industry's market share and earnings through direct competition in overseas markets from aquaculture prawns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to note that we are also developing an aquaculture prawn industry. Last year, the Minister for Resources visited an aquaculture prawn farm outside Edmonton, in my electorate. The value of aquaculture in Australia is $254 million, but worldwide it is a $43.4 billion industry&mdash;and those are 1992 figures. That means that Australia only has 0.5 per cent, in 1992 terms at least, of the world market. This legislation is a direct consequence of the burgeoning world market in aquaculture, and the government's and industry's response to that difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China now ranks as the top world producer of aquaculture prawns, with 22 per cent of the world output of cultured prawns, and that is expected in the near future to increase to 30 per cent. Other major aquaculture exporting countries are Indonesia, Thailand, Ecuador and Taiwan, and the industry in India is growing. This represents a significant change in these countries, because in the last 20 years there has been a complete shift from captured prawns, which dominated the market in these countries, to aquaculture. And that is the reason the legislation is before the committee today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of problems facing the Australian prawn industry and I am indebted to one of my constituents, Mr Bill Izard, who has written to me, as well as to the federal and state ministers, in relation to a particular problem which I want to raise. That is the problem of the decline in the prawn brood stock population. Mr Izard has been involved in the industry, supplying prawn brood stock to local aquaculture and, to a limited extent, overseas aquaculture. He wrote to me last year and I will quote from the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last four years I have conducted my own prawn tagging study to investigate the size and movements of the Cairns broodstock prawn population. Of great concern is that within six weeks, 20% (a very large proportion) of tagged prawns are captured by vessels fishing the stocks, indicating that the stocks could potentially be easily overfished. If we were to service the overseas markets to the level they currently demand, such overfishing would be very likely. This increased demand from overseas is most likely to occur because our broodstocks have no known diseases and are very attractive to overseas prawn farmers.</PARA>
<PARA>It is pleasing to note that controls on export and collection of live prawns in order to control aquaculture brood stock have been suggested by the Australian prawn farmers association. The national agency that is dealing with this matter is the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, and the industry suggestions are being currently reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Live Fish, which advises the ANCA. I thank Mr Izard for raising those concerns, which are significant. He is greatly concerned. In fact, I spoke to him this morning. He is at the moment off the coast of Cairns, at False Cape, trying to find out where the prawn brood stock goes. Apparently, at this time of year it just disappears. That is of concern to the industry and to people like him, who are involved in the general fishing and prawn industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter is of great concern and should be of concern both to Australian aquaculture and to the world industry. I have mentioned that most of the world's aquaculture supply comes from Asia. There is a great concern that the industry in Asia, to put it very frankly, is not a sustainable industry in terms of the environment. I am indebted to the Parliamentary Library for supplying me with an article by Nigel Forteath, published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Fisheries</EMPHASIS> of March 1993. In this article he highlights a lot of difficulties in relation to the lack of environmental sustainability in terms of aquaculture in South-East Asia. This ought to be of concern to us. It is obviously a reason why we should develop marketing strategies to sell our environmentally clean industry, but also it is a warning to the Australian industry, in terms of aquaculture, not to make the mistakes of Asia. Nigel Forteath says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a recent visit to Asia, the author was surprised to witness the harvesting of prawns for immediate sale which were being fed a diet liberally laced with a chloramphenicol.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a growth hormone. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian aquaculturists would do well to promote their management practices in the face of increasing competition from prominent foreign producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of hormones to promote growth in fish is not a new concept but consumer resistance has restricted their use to laboratory trials. It is essential that whenever hormones are used to enhance aquaculture production the public are fully and honestly informed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would totally agree with that. Further on, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Asia and South America in particular, uncontrolled expansion of intensive coastal aquaculture has resulted in a plethora of disease and water quality problems, to say nothing about the destruction of fish nurseries.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues with a very interesting point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rapid expansion in prawn culture in Asia may well limit or even destroy itself by auto-pollution. This has occurred already in Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA>A final point is worth making:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competition for land and water between terrestrial farmers and aquaculturists has been a hall-mark of prawn farming in parts of Asia. In these countries, rich and powerful investors have caused serious problems for villagers by replacing traditional rice farming with ponds or flooding land with saltwater from poorly designed pondages . . . As a result, subsistence economics are in competition with aquaculture.</PARA>
<PARA>All this leads to the conclusion that it is obvious that Australia should not follow the model of South-East Asia. These bills will provide the resources in terms of both marketing and research to enable us to develop niche markets and to market our product as clean and environmentally friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that our competitive edge in terms of international prawn markets is afforded by the pristine waters of the tropical coast&mdash;some of which are off my electorate&mdash;which harbour some 13 species of commercially fished prawns. These species are the royal red prawn, greasyback prawn, blue endeavour prawn, red endeavour prawn, school prawn, brown tiger prawn, grooved tiger prawn, white banana prawn, red-legged banana prawn, western king prawn, red spot king prawn, eastern king prawn and giant tiger prawn. The aims of the proposed arrangements are to facilitate the opening up of new niche markets overseas and, importantly, the consolidation of existing markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As you are no doubt aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the legislative arrangements proposed by these bills, the Prawn Boat Levy Bill 1994 and Prawn Export Charge Bill 1994, follow the standard for primary industries levies and charges legislation, that is, an administrative act, an imposition act and a collection act. It is important to note that the levy and charge provided by the Prawn Levy Bill 1994 and the Prawn Export Charge Bill 1994 have been imposed by the Commonwealth at the request of the Australian Prawn Promotion Association. That follows a request from the prawn industry that a compulsory levy be made on prawn fishermen, processors and exporters to fund export promotional activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of bills puts into legislation form the APPA's self-help, self-funding promotional program, which is based on levies being paid on the length of boats and the volume of prawns exported. It is an excellent example of aspects of an industry working together to best promote their product to a common market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four categories of annual levy. Boats less than 10 metres in length will attract a $50 levy; between 10 and 15 metres $100; between 15 and 18 metres $200; and over 18 metres $500. Sea caught prawns and parts of sea caught prawns exported from Australia will be subject to a 2c per kilogram charge to be payable by the exporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation boat levies and export charges can be raised only after the Governor-General has considered recommendations made to the minister by APPA following approval by its annual general meeting. This strategic initiative by the APPA aims to promote Australian sea caught prawns as superior quality prawns caught in pristine Australian seas. The export promotion is aimed mainly at the Asian market. The pristine nature of the water surrounding tropical Australia, as I have said earlier, is our key marketing tool. There is no doubt that Australia's reputation as a clean, safe environment for the production of foodstuffs will grow and become a pivotal marketing quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect I want to draw the attention of the House to the need to do everything we can to avoid oil spills in the waters to our north, especially within the Great Barrier Reef. Clearly, an oil spill would cause economic loss as well as incalculable environmental damage.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been highlighted&mdash;and we cannot hide from the fact&mdash;that the further up the Great Barrier Reef one goes, the greater the disaster which would have to be dealt with, especially in the area north of Cooktown where there is not a great deal of infrastructure of any sort. An oil spill in that part of the Great Barrier Reef going up to the Torres Strait would obviously be a disaster and one that would be very difficult to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the industry has seen the benefits of a coordinated and structured approach to generic promotion rather than staying with the fragmentation of the past. I am also pleased that the industry has been vocal on the need to prevent the pollution of the coastline and the reef. The APPA's aims are also consistent with the government's policy of value adding and the `clean green' trade push into Asia. The APPA has assured the government that a majority of its members welcome the promotional activity. It is anticipated that the arrangements will raise some half a million dollars for promotional activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gross value of Australian prawn production is estimated to total $278.107 million and 20,251 tonnes in 1993-94, compared to $282.403 million and 24,440 tonnes in 1992-93. Fisheries within the Commonwealth jurisdiction produce the largest quantity of prawns. The northern prawn fisheries is the principal prawn producing fishery under Commonwealth jurisdiction. The NPF extends from Cape York Peninsula in my electorate to the east to Cape Londonderry, Western Australia, in the west, and of course takes in the Carpentaria prawn fishery. The NPF covers approximately one million square kilometres and produced an estimated catch of 5,789 tonnes, valued at $98.812 million, in 1993-94, compared with a catch of 7,781 tonnes, valued at approximately $100 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are nine species of prawn caught in the NPF but three species, banana, tiger and endeavour prawns, account for approximately 80 per cent of the fishery's catch. Management policies in the NPF were first introduced in the 1970s. The current management scheme incorporates various regulations, including seasonal closures, daylight trawling bans, boat replacement rules, gear restrictions and compulsory pro rata surrender of certain licences to reduce the number of boats operating in the fishery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the compulsory surrender of fishing licences in the NPF, the Bureau of Resource Sciences in its fishery status reports of 1993 reported that to improve the economic and biological viability of the NPF the fishery underwent a restructuring intended to reduce fishing capacity by approximately 40 per cent from the 1990 level. A total of 127 vessels fished for prawns in the NPF in 1993, compared with a total of 200 vessels in 1990. The BRS reported in its fishery status reports of 1993 that the NPF is commercially fully exploited. While moves to reduce the number of vessels in the fleet were not met with enthusiasm by the industry, there is little doubt that, for the industry to be sustainable, action had to be taken. It simply does not make economic sense to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major prawn fishery under Commonwealth jurisdiction is the Torres Strait prawn fishery. The Torres Strait is in my electorate and is located between the tip of Cape York and Papua New Guinea. The TSPF produced an estimated catch of 1,023 tonnes valued at $9.86 million in 1993-94, compared with a catch of 1,622 tonnes in 1992-93 valued at $13.186 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a few words in the few minutes I have got left about the Torres Strait Protected Zone Authority, which has introduced management arrangements designed to control fishing effort but not disadvantage existing operations in the Torres Strait prawn fishery. The Torres Strait prawn fishery is the most valuable of all Torres Strait commercial fisheries in terms of the 1991-92 figures. The Torres Strait prawn grounds are distributed through the Torres Strait protected zone and `the outside but near areas'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the Torres Strait is closed to prawn trawling, mostly on industry initiative. The areas to the west and south-west of the Warrior Reefs, including the water around Sue, Yam, Badu, Moa, Mabuiag and Gabba islands and as far south as the tip of Cape York, are also closed to prawn trawling because of the abundance of juvenile prawns in those grounds. Concerns from the Island Coordinating Council and the removal of the non-transferability provisions in 1992 combined to necessitate the introduction of the new management arrangements for the fishery in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for a sustainable future for Australia's fishing industry. As I said earlier, the industry, which is based mainly in Asia, cannot be seen as a particularly clean industry in relation to aquaculture. Nevertheless, it is expanding. We have got to respond to that expansion. To do that you need both promotion and research and development. To do that you have got to have dollars, and that is what this legislation is about. It has got the support of industry and it has got the support of both sides of parliament. It will provide, I am confident, a prosperous and sustainable future for Australia's prawn industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make some brief comments in support of this legislation. It is always helpful to be speaking on legislation that has bipartisan support in this House. The Prawn Export Promotion Bill 1994, the Prawn Boat Levy Bill 1994 and the Prawn Export Charge Bill 1994 are all aimed at supporting our domestic prawn industry, which, as previous speakers have said, is a valuable part of our fishing export industry. I note that, while we have the third largest fishing zone in the world, we rank only 50th in fisheries production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big picture shows that the gross value of Australian fisheries production in 1993-94 was $1,606 million, representing a seven per cent increase in value over the previous year. However, in relation to the prawn industry the picture has not been quite so bright. The export value of prawns in 1993-94 was $197 million, as previous speakers have said, but that is a decrease over the previous years, both in volume of production and in returns to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be aware that Australia is also an importer of prawns, and that, in 1993-94, we imported 12,870 tonnes of prawns which were worth $101 million. Thailand is one of the countries which exports prawns to Australia, and this country is one of the largest suppliers. Australia not only has the problem of competing in the export market, but also has the problem of being an importer for the country's domestic needs. Apart from the focus of this legislation, in the promotion of our own excellent quality prawns to the Asia-Pacific markets we have to look at developing our own aquaculture industry to fill the domestic gap. It would seem to me to be a valuable opportunity to promote regional development and to improve the economy, certainly in northern Australia. We have here an opportunity to meet our needs and to promote regional industry. As an aside, I mention that the University of Central Queensland has a small aquaculture project. This is the type of initiative that should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, Japan is one of our chief markets for seafood. I want to quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Fisheries</EMPHASIS>, June 1990, Volume 49, No. 6. Referring to the year 1989, the authors said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demand for Australian prawns in Japan&mdash;our main export market&mdash;declined markedly. Spectacular growth in Asian aquaculture production and subsequent increases in Japanese prawn imports lead to the quantity of prawns in cold storage reaching record levels. . . . Japan is Australia's major seafood export market, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of Australia's seafood exports in 1988-89.</PARA>
<PARA>At that stage, Australia's prawn sales to Japan amounted to approximately 8.3 kilotonnes, but our share of the prawn market is declining. The authors suggested that, apart from competition from aquaculture, there is some competition from changing domestic requirements in Japan. Further on in the article, the authors state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fundamental changes in Japanese eating habits are also likely to be affecting the demand for prawns. . . . In particular, household consumption of seafood is decreasing among young people. If they continue to favour alternative products to seafood, then seafood demand could fall as the population ages, with potentially serious implications to Australian exports.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the reasons for this situation is the change in eating habits of Japanese people, and their move from seafood to beef. There is not only a change in terms of household food production, but also an increasing trend in Japan towards the production of takeaway food. That trend may be very positive for our beef industry, but it probably will not be helpful to our prawn exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues which must be taken into consideration are the costs of the two industries. If we compare the cost to process prawns caught off our coastline with the cost of aquaculture, the figures are interesting. I quote again from the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult for Australian prawn fishermen to compete on a price basis with the aquaculture producers in Asia. Production costs for Asian farmed prawns were about $5.00 per kg in 1989. . . . This contrasts with average Australian production costs in the northern prawn fishery (NPF) of about $10.00 per kilogram in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, it is going to be a problem for the industry to remain viable. We have to look for niche markets that stress the particular qualities of our seafood production. That will inevitably involve issues such as environmental standards and the post-catch processing and transportation of our seafood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to this bill, the industry requested government assistance when it found that attempting to voluntarily collect the levy was not successful. It is another example of the government consulting with industry to provide an efficient way in which the industry can gather funds to provide effective promotion for its product. There is no doubt that where an excellent quality product exists and is marketed successfully there will be a market for it, particularly in overseas restaurant sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues which concerns producers in my electorate of Capricornia at this point is the fact that production has dropped over the last two years. This would seem to relate to the drought conditions in central Queensland. In my discussions with them the old saying that came very much to the fore was that a drought on the land is a drought at sea. The reason for that is that there has not been enough rain to wash the eggs out of the estuaries for spawning and then there is not enough water for the baby prawns to swim back into the estuaries to grow. So, while the drought is now affecting our balance of payments, as has been indicated in statements by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the last two sitting weeks, it is clear that here is yet another side effect of the drought conditions as they affect central Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been some problems with the weather. The boats have been unable to get out. A number of independent fishermen and producers in the Yeppoon area have stopped work altogether. Most of the prawns sold at our local co-op at Rosslyn Bay are for the domestic market. If tiger prawns or king prawns are caught, they are usually sold through the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to overseas markets through a southern buyer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also value added and processing operations in my electorate. Tony Newton, from Tanby Seafoods, supports the concerns of the Rosslyn Bay Fishermen's Cooperative Association. To meet the domestic market, he has been forced to buy green prawns out of Townsville or Cairns prawns which come from the northern region. There are then increased prices and people are less prepared to purchase. So, from our local perspective, the drought has had a major impact. Indeed, in the longer term we have to look at land management because that will affect the flow-on through coastal river systems to those estuaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that will be of longer term importance to industries such as the prawn industry is the way we look after our coastal areas. This was alluded to by my colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). Issues such as removing mangroves from coastal areas and beachfront developments all affect the future production of the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a community and as a country, we have to put a lot of effective forward planning into coastal management to make sure that local government does not allow domestic development on foreshores, dunal areas and estuaries that is going to impact on what is a very important industry, and potentially a very important export industry, for Australia&mdash;the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does echo the concerns of a number of conservation groups. It is important that, rather than this issue becoming a political football, we sit down and carefully plan the way we are going to promote ecologically sustainable development right around the coastline of this country. Increasingly, we will have to look at industries such as fishing to provide jobs for people, to provide export income and value-added industries. That means that the industry and governments have to work together to make sure that we do not overfish and deplete our stocks. This is an issue of some concern because, as in the case I mentioned in my own electorate, when the prawns are not there, there is nothing to fish and people are forced out of the industry temporarily, or sometimes permanently. In order to have a sustainable industry, we must harvest it correctly. This should involve state and federal departments of primary industry working with producer organisations, which has been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very positive initiative by the industry. However, having provided effective promotion, what we have to look at in the long term is the development of our own aquaculture&mdash;which, I believe, can be competitive with overseas&mdash;not only to meet our own domestic demands, but to provide volume for our exports.

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up its allocated subscription to the fourth general capital increase of the Asian Development Bank&mdash;ADB. This means Australia would subscribe to 102,370 shares, of which only 2,047 shares will be paid in at a cost of $US24.69 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that the bank, which was established in 1966, is a major multilateral development finance institution engaged in promoting social and economic advancement in the Asia-Pacific region. Major borrowers include the People's Republic of China, Indonesia and India. The bank has 55 member countries from within and outside the region. The bank's capital is of two kinds: paid-in and callable. The capital increase involves actual payment by members of the paid-in component, and a potential liability for the callable component. The callable component of the bank's capital serves as collateral against which the bank borrows funds for on-lending. The bank's loans have been financed largely by funds borrowed from international financial markets. A call on the callable capital of the bank has never been made. The bank's prudent financial policies and healthy level of reserves make it unlikely that such a call will ever be made in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bank's articles of agreement, the maximum amount of funds the bank can lend cannot exceed the total amount of its unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves and surplus. In March 1994 the bank reached its lending limit and stopped making new loan commitments. In May 1994, the ADB Board of Governors approved a resolution authorising a general capital increase which doubles the share allocation from 1,720,497 shares to 3,440,994 shares. This will allow the bank to expand its borrowings and so finance the bank's operations to beyond the year 2000 and allow the bank to pursue its development objectives in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the general capital increase, Australia is entitled to subscribe to an additional 102,370 shares. Only two per cent of these shares need to be paid in. As a result of the low paid-in component, the annual cost of the subscription accounts for a very small part of Australia's aid budget. In supporting the bank, Australia recognises the significant contribution it has made to developing countries in Asia. In pursuing its original prime objective of economic growth and poverty alleviation, the bank has also emphasised private sector development, public sector efficiency, human resource development and natural resource management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, at the urging of Australia and other donor countries, the bank is paying greater attention to environmental and social problems. In fact, the agreement of several donor countries to adopt the resolution for an additional share allocation was conditional upon the adoption of a policy statement to guide the bank's operations in the 1990s. This statement emphasises initiatives to strengthen the planning process in the bank, incorporating cross-cutting concerns such as poverty, population, women in development, social sector investment and the environment, and addressing new policy issues such as good governance, disclosure of information and the establishment of an inspection function to review potential non-compliance of bank policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of these initiatives have either been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. The bank has now established a fifty-fifty mix between traditional projects which emphasised economic growth and those projects which are aimed at poverty reduction, human resource development, women in development and environmental protection. The main way in which the bank assists its developing country members is by providing loans for economic and social infrastructure development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1966 and 1993, the bank provided its member countries with loans totalling $US32.8 billion from its ordinary capital resources. The bank's lending is primarily to the public sector. However, some direct and indirect funding of the private sector has also been undertaken. The bank's lending activities have focused on projects in the agriculture, energy, finance, transport and communications and social infrastructure sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to its financing activities, the bank plays an important role in providing advice on economic policies, sector restructuring and institutional development in developing member countries. Policy reform measures relating to macro-economic policies, sector programs and projects are usually associated with the bank's lending activities and are aimed at improving economic growth prospects, ameliorating poverty and addressing social inequities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic policies promoted by the bank are outward looking and consistent with the development of open international trade and financial markets. Through its lending and technical assistance activities, the bank supports the strengthening of institutions which are essential for economic and social advancement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's participation in the bank allows us to pursue our economic, political and humanitarian interests in collaboration with other donor and developing countries. The bank's activities have complemented Australia's bilateral aid program in a number of countries, most particularly in Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific island countries and Vietnam. Participation in the Asian Development Bank has also allowed us to widen the focus of our aid at a relatively low administrative cost. Australian membership of the bank entitles Australian suppliers of goods and services to bid for work generated under bank financed activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past five years, loan disbursements by the bank have averaged $US2.6 billion per year. This provides a sizeable commercial opportunity for Australian firms. The most significant benefit to Australia from the bank's activities, however, is not direct procurement from bank projects but the wider export opportunities for Australian businesses deriving from economic growth promoted by the bank in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian exports to the developing member countries of the bank increased from $12.7 billion in 1988-89 to $23 billion in 1992-93. As a proportion of total Australian exports, exports to those countries rose from 29 per cent to 38 per cent during this five-year period. There is enormous potential for further exports as economic growth in the region continues. Australia is a founding member of the ADB and a strong supporter of it. At the same time, Australia has not been uncritical of the bank where criticism has been justified and it has been pressing the bank to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to concerns expressed by Australia and other countries about the quality of bank loans, in 1993 the bank established a task force to provide recommendations for improving project quality. Following the report of the task force in early 1994, the bank has taken measures to improve the quality of projects. As recommended by the task force, the bank is currently reviewing its organisational structure to make it more relevant to its strategic objectives and to improve the quality of its projects through improved coordination of its project and program work, greater attention to project implementation vis-a-vis project approvals, strengthening of project executing agencies in the borrowing countries, and improved accountability for the quality of projects within the ADB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the economic and political significance of the Asia-Pacific region to Australia and the important developmental role which the Asian Development Bank is playing in the region amply justify Australia's continuing support of the bank by taking up the 102,370 shares of the bank's general capital increase. I commend the bill to honourable members and I now present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 1994 was introduced into the House on 24 August last year. The coalition does not oppose the bill. This bill empowers the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to make the necessary agreement with the Asian Development Bank for the purchase by Australia of its entitlement of 2,047 additional paid-in shares, and 100,323 additional callable shares, of the capital stock of the bank.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB is a major institution in Australia's multilateral development program. It provides loans, policy advice, equity finance and technical assistance to developing member countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The bank has 53 member countries from within and outside this region. Australia already holds 102,370 shares in the bank valued at $US1.406 billion and that represents just over six per cent of the total capital subscribed to the bank. Of this figure, $US168.8 million has been paid to the bank, with the remaining $US1.237 billion subject to call. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the fourth largest regional shareholder in the Asian Development Bank, the fifth largest overall and a founding member of the bank. During 1993 a central issue before shareholders was the negotiation of the fourth capital increase. This proved difficult because of differences of view on the size and financial conditions applying to an increase in the capital base and on certain conditions which some shareholders sought to attach to bank policies in supporting a capital increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1994 the board of governors of the bank adopted resolution No. 232 to increase authorised capital by 100 per cent to $US48.8 billion with a paid-in component of just two per cent. Australia has supported a general capital increase in the bank and the Treasurer, Australia's representative on the board of governors, cast his vote in favour of the resolution on a general capital increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total cost of 2,047 paid-in shares is $US24.69 million. This amount is payable over a 10-year period. The value of 1,323 callable shares is $US1,210.25 million. Fortunately, I believe these callable shares will only become payable if the ADB faces a collapse of a very serious magnitude, and we all hope that that does not happen and presumably believe it is not in prospect. These callable shares are a safeguard for the ADB which should never need to be called upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the ADB has no doubt been responsible in the past for making a minor positive contribution to developing nations in the Asia-Pacific region, it is likely that Australia can better utilise its foreign aid resources by using different methods. The ADB as well as the World Bank seems to spend an inordinate amount of its money on administration. As members are aware, the Asian Development Bank is based in Manila. The building it occupies cost $US172 million, it has marble corridors and fine artworks adorn the walls. The building is in a city where there are constant brownouts due to a shortage of electricity generation. But the ADB headquarters is not affected by that; it sensibly has its own stand-by generators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 it was reported that for the ADB's 1,600 employees there were more than 300 Mercedes cars with all the cars out of the car park by 5 p.m. The salary range was $US40,000 to $US120,000 which for non-Americans and Filipinos was tax free. There are also housing and education subsidies on offer. No doubt they now receive much more rewarding remuneration packages, but no fringe benefits tax. Lucky them!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It sounds like a very nice lifestyle, but at the end of the day the ADB is supposed to be about assisting economic growth in developing Asia-Pacific countries and alleviating poverty. No doubt there is a great wastage of funds at the ADB: funds which could be used to improve the livelihood of many, many more people. The question must therefore constantly be asked: is the ADB a worthwhile recipient of part of our aid budget? The Australian Council for Overseas Aid, ACFOA, and Community Aid Abroad, CAA, both lament contributions made to multilateral development banks, or MDBs, including the Asian Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACFOA estimates that the proportion of the total aid budget going to the MDBs will increase from about 10 per cent to 18 per cent over the coming years. CAA maintains that the proportion of the aid budget going to these multilateral development banks must remain at its current percentage of the aid budget. For CAA, if the commitments to the MDBs continue to increase then all other parts of the aid program should receive commensurate increases in funding to maintain what CAA sees as the ideal mix. Of course, Community Aid Abroad has a vested interest in advocating an increase and pushing for increased funding for non-government organisations or NGOs, as it could expect to be a leading beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is of the view that too many of our foreign aid dollars go to the MDBs. However, we reject the abhorrence by the NGOs of the government's focusing Australia's aid program on specific regions to complement our foreign affairs and trade interests. In that we depart from the NGOs and their views. If Australia is to provide foreign aid, it should be done in a way that maximises the benefit to the recipients, and it should be in Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that the ADB is a major catalyst in promoting the development of the most populous and fast growing region in the world today, thereby implying that the massive economic growth in our region is attributable in some measure to the ADB. It should be readily apparent that the massive economic growth in our region is due principally to private domestic capital formation and foreign direct investment from private sector sources. The significance of this is that it is frequently argued that foreign aid is essential to capital formation; which, in turn, is essential to wealth creation. In fact, capital formation is the result of economic growth, not its precursor. The economic development of the West was not underpinned by foreign aid, nor is the bulk of economic development in our region due to foreign aid. Indeed, Asia-Pacific governments and businesses can readily borrow funds, both domestically and internationally, from private sector sources&mdash;assuming always that the projects for which they are seeking support are productive and the country concerned does not have an overly restrictive foreign investment regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution to the economic development of our region of the concessional finance that is disbursed by the Asian Development Fund, the ADF, is thus limited to the savings made by borrowings from the ADF rather than from private sector sources, with the difference being paid for by taxpayers of the shareholding nations. The contribution of such foreign aid to economic development is therefore minimal. Moreover, it may well be that these savings do not offset the costs involved, because some of this capital is lost to the supporting bureaucracies involved in administering the donor's aid programs, as well as by the recipient governments' administrative excesses. Many, even most, of the recipient governments to which we dispense foreign aid in this way are notorious for the misallocation of these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report to this parliament, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the Asian Development Bank 1993</EMPHASIS>, makes it clear that the performance of the bank in picking winners is not terribly good. Of those projects that had their performance evaluated in 1993, only 62 per cent were deemed to have been `generally successful'. I pose the question: what does `generally successful' mean. Only 30 per cent or whatever per cent were actually successful. The term `generally successful' is obviously used to obfuscate the actual lack of success by the ADB and its inability to choose which projects warrant ADB funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB must also rate its projects in terms of whether they were totally successful. Only then will the post-project evaluations have real meaning. Only 22 per cent of projects were found to be partly successful, and 15 per cent were unsuccessful. These figures indicate that a minimum of 38 per cent of the projects funded through the ADB were less than fully successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, in agriculture, the ADB appears to have no ability to differentiate between good projects and bad. In agriculture in 1993, only 40 per cent of projects were generally successful; 40 per cent were partly successful and 20 per cent were unsuccessful. Of course, in developing nations most poverty occurs in rural areas, where successful aid programs can have a real impact on the quality of life of a great number of people. It is an indictment of the ADB that in agriculture it is such a failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB has traditionally not been a significant lender to the private sector, as it has preferred to target public sector infrastructure projects. However, the bank&mdash;at its last annual general meeting, held in May 1994&mdash;stated that it intended to turn increasingly to private sector financing to keep Asia-Pacific economies on the road to growth. Andrew MacCathie, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 6 May wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Private bankers from the world's principal financial markets have increasingly questioned the ongoing role of a multi-national institution, such as the ADB, operating in a region characterised by extraordinary economic growth and an accumulation of wealth. The intense western interest in investing in the region has already helped to prise open, for many Asian Pacific nations, the international private loan and financing markets.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, Mr Deputy Speaker, many nations in the region are now internally generating or attracting sufficient capital, or have access to offshore financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What role is left for ADB? If we were really interested in the development of the private sector in developing countries, we would facilitate its access to foreign direct investment from private sources by having the ADB and other international financial institutions pull out of international capital markets. If anything, concessional lending by the ADB through the ADF encourages the recipient countries to maintain restrictive foreign investment regimes, so that their governments can maintain control of the bulk of the foreign investment activities in those countries and obtain investment on concessional terms. Where the ADB provides loans for projects intended to alleviate poverty, this should be only undertaken in those countries that have pro-economic growth policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ADB assistance to governments in developing countries ignores the fact that it is often those very same governments that are responsible for the impoverished state of their people. While lending to non-government organisations can be an effective way of bypassing the destructive policies of such governments, lending to the governments themselves is effectively a pat on the back for their policies and may even assist them in pursuing those failed policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to conceive how official development assistance can help alleviate poverty in countries with governments that systematically impoverish their people in the quest for political and economic control. These governments also often maintain large military establishments, further underlining their own lack of commitment to poverty alleviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">India, for example, has been undertaking a massive militarisation expansion in recent decades. In 1991 India's military expenditure as a proportion of its gross domestic product was 50 per cent greater than Australia's. India has a blue water navy, which includes two aircraft carriers, and I understand there is a third on order. These are armed forces of a dimension about which Australia can only dream. China also has a massive military machine and, unlike India, is a totalitarian dictatorship. China is also rapidly developing a blue water navy, which will enable it to project power and influence well into our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nations which can put large levels of national resources into the military and into repressive state organs do not deserve to receive concessional loans or even loans at commercial rates from the ADB for projects that might not otherwise qualify for commercial financing from other non-MDB institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB might very well lend for specific non-military purposes, but the implication of that for spending on military might, as it were, is that it takes the onus off the governments of such countries to provide funding which the ADB substitutes. So they are then able to appropriate internally generated wealth into the military machines that have the potential to grow. The People's Republic of China, Vietnam and India have three of the largest standing armies in the world. They are right up there in the top 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the role of taxpayer funded MDBs to prop up profligate governments, and I am sure other taxpayers in other nations that provide capital to the ADB would agree with this if they knew it was happening. Official development assistance should follow political and economic liberalisation rather than precede it if it is to have any hope of achieving meaningful poverty alleviation. It is clear that Australia needs to conduct a detailed review of its aid program and its role in multinational development banks and agencies. This review must examine the arrangements under which the aid budget could best help developing nations and also what is in Australia's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that Australia's foreign aid program must take into account more selective criteria than are applied at the moment. There is a need to focus on our region, the Asia-Pacific, reflecting our foreign policy and trade priorities. The main objective of our foreign policy should be to build strong and substantial bilateral ties with our neighbours. To do that it might very well be wise to go to programs of bilateral aid rather than laundering part of our aid package through these international financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems more interested in multilateral relations and funding through such agencies as the ADB and conducting its affairs through the United Nations, which provide it with a glamorous but wasteful footing on the world stage. The real work to further Australia's interests, both national security and economic, must be centred on regional bilateral ties. Consequently, our foreign aid program needs to complement our foreign policy. Our aid program must focus on our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This should be based on a hard-headed foreign policy which is based in turn upon enlightened self-interest&mdash;to identify Australia's changing national interests and to put those interests first.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy approach, however, should not be implemented at the cost of emergency and humanitarian aid, which the coalition believes should be maintained. That is in a different category altogether and is not included in my criticism. There must be increased emphasis on the alleviation of poverty and the delivery of services through the NGOs. Delivering aid through NGOs is a quite effective way of bypassing the destructive policies of some governments and getting maximum value for our aid dollar. Unfortunately, even NGOs can stuff up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia-China Council is providing $300,000 per annum to fund the Australian Studies Centre at the East China Normal University, in Shanghai.

Such goings-on, I presume, are not the norm. Apparently the consulate in Shanghai knows what is happening in the Australian Studies Centre but has done or can do little about it. If this account which I have is accurate, it is a wasteful use of taxpayer funds and it should be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preference should be given to bilateral aid and the provision of Australian goods and services. Bilateral aid is an effective method of strengthening our relations with countries in our region. By encouraging the provision of Australian goods and services there is still a shift of taxpayer funds offshore, but at least some of the percentage is expended in Australia, providing jobs for Australians. Provision of Australian goods and services can in some circumstances encourage future trade. This is certainly better than our aid being used to purchase goods and services from other countries, with no benefit for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aid should not be applied in ways which support repressive governments or those with excessive military expenditure.

We get a bit holier than thou in some cases when talking about human rights in other countries. Whilst our open aid program can be modified according to our public rhetoric of objection to human rights activities in certain countries, moneys going through such institutions as the one we are talking about today are not identified with Australia and, therefore, we can escape some legitimate criticism for having double standards about human rights in countries in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those countries which encourage economic freedom and pursue economic growth strategies are the countries which should receive first priority in our allocation of foreign aid which is channelled in this way. To provide aid to countries which have no regard for market or economic freedom will only encourage those countries to remain inefficient and will only reinforce their dependency on foreign aid. Foreign aid should be used to reward those countries that are implementing policies that are geared towards economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of aid to those countries will, in the long term, also assist a move towards a democratic political system in the country receiving aid.

Really, our aid funds, which are a relatively small element of our total aid package, are multiplied in their value through the funds that can be borrowed commercially and then lent to the developing countries.

I think some of the figures that were quoted by the honourable member were, in fact, from Asian Development Bank publications, so the bank itself does recognise major problems which it has.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But they do need help. That is, perhaps, the next point I should come to, because there is still a strong imperative for the kinds of lending that the Asian Development Bank does. There is still, in many countries in the region, a major problem of large-scale poverty. Indonesia, for example, has had a very good record of reduction of poverty during the last 30 or 40 years of its independence. It has steadily and quite effectively reduced the level of poverty. But there are still 30 million people living in absolute poverty in Indonesia. It is a rapidly growing country, but its population is also very rapidly growing, so it is very difficult for that country to grow sufficiently fast to raise per capita income at a rate that will continue to rapidly reduce its problem with poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia needs external funds in order to build the infrastructure and to train the people. It also needs the funds to ensure that small-scale credit is available for small-scale business, for land reform and for all of the other essential aspects of an appropriate economic development policy. The Asian Development Bank has had a very significant role in Indonesia. It also has a very useful role in many other countries in the region. If we are seriously concerned about poverty reduction and reduction of unemployment&mdash;in other words, the more effective use of the human resources of those countries enabling more fulfilling lives for those people&mdash;we should be aiming to ensure that the funds available to them are maximised and are available at the lowest rate that is possible. There are two very good reasons why we should continue to support the Asian Development Bank, and that is one. The second is the growing interdependence of the region, and that is now clear to everyone in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), in his second reading speech referred to the growth of trade in the region. I will not refer to it again, as the situation was well-described by him. There has been very strong growth in Australian exports to the countries of the region during the last decade and that has been of great benefit to us. It is also of benefit to them. Because their economies are growing strongly, the markets for our goods are expanding strongly and that is essential for us at a time when, as we all know, we have a current account problem. It is very important that we increase even further our exports to the region and that is where our opportunity for export growth is strongest. The faster the economies of those countries grow, the greater the opportunity for us to export to them, and we should be aiming to facilitate that growth, in so far as we have any influence over it. It is also true that, globally, countries are increasingly interdependent, not only through trade but through investment, through financial issues, and even through migration and tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to the financial question in a moment but, before I do, I want to say a little more about the Asian Development Bank. The bank is certainly not above criticism. It has been remarked quite often that it is a relatively privileged organisation working in the midst of poverty, and certainly that is true of Manila. That does not mean that its staff should not be paid adequate salaries, but it can be argued that the staff are paid rather higher salaries than would be warranted. This point has also been made in relation to the staff of the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the Asian Development Bank has been paring off a little of the additional pay that its staff receive, and that is to be welcomed. I hope that members of its staff, like those of the World Bank, are now flying business class rather than first class. Those sorts of changes, which will not significantly undermine the quality of its working life, are important as a way of demonstrating to shareholders that the funds that are made available are used as effectively as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that the bureaucracy within the Asian Development Bank is rather sheltered, that it does not get out enough, and that it is not sensitive enough to the problems of poverty, unemployment and inequity with which it has to deal. I do not have enough personal experience of the ADB to know whether that is true but, since it is said authoritatively by people who do, one would hope that that has been looked at and that ways of increasing the sensitivity of staff are being examined. However, it has to be said that much that the ADB does is very worthwhile. I have seen some evidence of that in Papua New Guinea. I know of it in some other countries and I think, for the reasons that I gave at the beginning of this speech, we should be strongly supporting the ADB and our contribution to it. It is a cost-effective way of ensuring that our aid funds are well used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am well aware that the Australian Council for Overseas Aid would like to see a larger proportion of our aids funds going in bilateral aid and in support of non-government organisations. The answer to that criticism, of course, is that our total aid funding ought to be growing faster, and that is something that I and the honourable member opposite, and others I know, do advocate. It is difficult for governments to increase aid funds at a time when they are trying to minimise outlays. But in an increasingly interdependent world, where we have to recognise that poverty in our neighbouring country is equivalent to the kind of poverty that existed in Britain at the time that Dickens was writing and when we are made aware of that with as much vividness as were the English when Dickens was writing, we have no alternative&mdash;if we are going to be decent human beings&mdash;but to make our contribution to poverty reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a very strong imperative for maintaining and increasing our aid budget. But there is also that self-interested reason I gave earlier, which should not be forgotten either. I hope that we will continue to increase our total aid budget and, in doing that, increase the amount going in bilateral aid and through non-government organisations, as well as taking up our full entitlement to this new ADB subscription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of criticism of the development banks in recent years, and I am delighted to see from the Assistant Treasurer's speech that some of that is being reflected in what the government is now saying about the development banks. The criticisms have included that they have not been transparent enough; that they have not been accountable enough; and that they have been too preoccupied with particular, narrow approaches to economic policy which have neglected the environment, or women, or equity, or even poverty. I think they are, at least rhetorically, expressing greater awareness of each of those problems now. The difficulty for them is in trying to embody this fresh orientation in their policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very glad to see the Assistant Treasurer saying that the bank is aiming to incorporate such cross-cutting concerns as poverty, population, women in development, social sector investment and the environment within its policies. All of those are areas which, in the past, it has not given enough attention to. Now that it is saying it is trying to do that, we should support it in making that a reality. It is encouraging that it says that is its aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin said that funds were often misallocated in borrowing countries. I have no doubt that there are some examples of that. I have no doubt that some of the programs have not been successful, and the bank itself has said as much. But it is important that evaluation be strengthened and that part of that evaluation be an attempt to learn from experience and to ensure that, in future, lending is more effective. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is quite correct&mdash;it does happen in Australia too. But when there is an awareness of that, the essential requirement is not to reduce funds but to aim to increase the quality of the programs, because they are certainly desperately needed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One criticism of the Asian Development Bank which has also received some attention is that it may not have spent enough of its funds in Australia or on Australian consultants. There has been some attempt to increase the awareness of the private sector in Australia of the opportunities which the bank offers, and it is important that more attention be given to that. When the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade did a report on the World Bank and the IMF, it drew attention to the opportunities which are available to our private sector through the development banks. Since then, there have been a number of public seminars, Austrade has made a much greater effort to publicise those opportunities, and the private sector is more aware now. But more could be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Curtin also criticised some countries for their excessive expenditure on military activity and in that I strongly support what he said. There is no doubt that some countries in our region are spending far more than appears to be warranted in strategic terms and that expenditure is absolute waste. It is a tragedy that India, with an enormous poverty problem, is still increasing its military expenditure. It is wasteful. It undermines our confidence that aid funds are going to be well used and it undermines international confidence that that country really knows what it is doing. It is very important that India recognises the damage it does to itself by that kind of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a little about the international financial markets. The Asian Development Bank and the other development banks have only a relatively limited brief, that is to channel funds largely from the private sector into development activities. At the same time as the Asian Development Bank has been doing its work, global financial interdependence has grown very strongly. There is now what one would have to recognise as a global international financial market. The problem is that there is great instability in that market, both in terms of the flow of funds and in exchange rates. There needs to be attention given by the development banks&mdash;including the IMF because it has become, in effect, an international development bank&mdash;to ways of increasing orderliness in international financial markets and to coping with market failure. The most recent example of that market failure was in the collapse of the Mexican peso and the implications that has had for lots of developing countries, including those in our region, which have been borrowing on international financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be serious thought given to ways of reducing that international financial instability which can so damage economic and social development within developing countries. There is a risk&mdash;one hopes a remote and small risk, but nevertheless a risk&mdash;of, at some point, a serious financial collapse in one country leading to similar events in other countries. There was a fear of that for a while in January following the collapse of the Mexican peso. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One possibility for addressing that issue would be for there to be a small tax on international financial transactions imposed globally. That idea is now beginning to get some quite serious consideration. It would have to be part of a package of measures. I read a very interesting article recently by Felix Rohatyn, a major New York financier, who was proposing an international financial organisation equivalent to the World Trade Organisation which would set standards for the international financial markets&mdash;accounting standards, reporting standards and provision of information standards. Those standards would make markets more transparent, more predictable and therefore less risky. That is an important part of the reform but another part of the reform is also to reduce the extent of very short-term speculation on international financial markets and that is the problem that this proposal for a small levy would address. It would reduce the incentive for very short-term capital movements and, therefore, would tend to reduce the instability of exchange rates. In so doing it would increase stability of financial markets, reduce the problem of monetary management for governments, raise revenue and be of assistance to governments in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a possibility that needs to be seriously studied. It would not be possible to endorse it as an idea yet, because not enough is known about it, but the world summit for social development has suggested that the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations examine that possibility. That idea is something that I endorse. I strongly endorse this bill and am glad that the opposition and the government are so strongly supporting the ADB. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of brief comments to make in relation to what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), was talking about before I talk specifically about the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, in terms of the overseas aid question and the size of the amount that goes in overseas aid as a percentage of the budget, I have to say that I would be at one with him in wishing to see that increased. One of the things that he might have regretted in the last decade is that his own government, which has been very vocal on this subject, has not really delivered on a lot of its rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see that government members&mdash;not only the honourable member for Fraser, but also the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear)&mdash;acknowledged that there are some difficulties with the Asian Development Bank and some of its activities. That is a welcome change from some of the rhetoric we have had from some members on the government side in the last two or three years when this matter has come up where the obvious and the inevitable has been denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it would be useful just to refresh our memories on some of the matters in this bill that we are being asked to agree to. We are told that the purpose is to authorise the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to enter into an agreement with the Asian Development Bank for the provision of additional capital and to issue promissory notes to cover obligations relating to additional callable shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know, by way of background, that the ADB has 53 member countries, of which 37 are regional members. These include Australia, Japan, the United States, Canada, Germany, China and many other Asian and Pacific countries. Of the members, 33 were classified as developing countries in 1993. The ADB provides loans, policy advice, equity finance and technical support to developing members in our region and large sums of money are lent&mdash;we are talking about billions of dollars. Without going through a category of all the individual figures, we are talking about significant amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The largest recipients have been China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Most loans are to finance projects and 78 per cent of them in 1993 were directed to publicly owned or guaranteed projects. ADB lending without a government guarantee totalled some $241 million in 1993. There are two types of loans. We can go into all that technicality but I do not want to repeat what has already been said in that respect. There are some areas such as China and India which, because of their size and because of their access to other forms of financing, are not eligible but, quite clearly, there are large dollops of money that go out from this source to those particular countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This aid is not tied, as other forms of aid quite frequently are. Equally, there is no sourcing as to where it comes from. As I understand it, during the 1989-93 period Australia's procurement from ADB projects exceeded contributions by roughly $170 million. So Australian businesses have actually got back more than the country has put in. But perhaps one has also got to look at whether other forms of activity might not have been even more beneficial. As the previous speaker mentioned, quite rightly, Austrade has been promoting this activity much more significantly in recent years, and that has been to the benefit of this country and firms in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1993, ADB considered its fourth capital increase to enable an expansion of its operations and identified a number of areas where additional assistance should be provided. These include additional efforts to address poverty through social sector expenditure on items such as health, education and nutrition; population and family planning programs; the integration of environmental matters into ADB considerations; financial sector and capital market reforms; and loans to members who were not previously active borrowers&mdash;for example, Cambodia and Vietnam. Following those considerations, it was agreed that the capital of the ADB needed to be doubled and the opportunity was there for member nations to take up that increase. This bill is all about Australia taking up its entitlement to that increased capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it would be worthwhile spending a few minutes talking about the need for investment in Asia, from this particular source or from other sources, and also the need for aid. The reality is that there are literally billions of poor people in the world, and Asia has more than its fair share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, rapidly growing economies, better communications and education are raising the expectations of many of our Asian neighbours that they too could share in the good life. These countries need to be assisted as they take the step from being third world countries to, hopefully, first world countries in fairly short order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to bear in mind that Asia seems to have more than its share of natural disasters. One thinks, particularly, of places such as Bangladesh where every couple of years</PARA>
<PARA>we seem to see television pictures of floods that have occurred there, the hundreds and thousands of people being made homeless, and the many tens of thousands who have been killed. The countries involved really do not have the financial resources to overcome those sorts of crises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are major food problems in the Asian area, especially in countries with rapidly growing populations such as India and China. But even so-called smaller countries in Asia have significant populations, whether it is Indonesia with 180-odd million, Pakistan with 100-odd million, or much smaller countries such as Thailand with a mere 45-odd million. When one compares their size with Australia's those countries have very significant basic food requirements. In many of those countries the rice yield, for example, is declining. So there is a need for food, services and infrastructure, all of which require money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the good fortune recently to visit Indonesia. It is quite apparent there that there is a dramatic shortage of skills and capital. As a major developing country, our nearest largest neighbour, Indonesia, needs help to develop in the way that we would all wish to see it develop. There is a large category of people in the very poor and starving categories. There is a small upper class and a burgeoning middle class, but that middle class is still surprisingly small. By one estimate that number might be 25 million by 2010 but at the moment it is certainly a very small category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that I would like to see ADB and other aid organisations giving more attention to, and the sort of thing that distressed me while I was there, was the direction in which some of the funds are going. In some of the suburbs of northern Jakarta there were people living in absolute, abject poverty; the health was appalling and the education was almost non-existent. The next day I was taken to Bandung up in the mountains where the government is spending literally billions of dollars trying to crash through with a modern aircraft building industry. It is an attempt by a particular government minister to jerk Indonesia out of the backwoods stage into the modern technological era. However, to do that, skills and knowledge are required, and people were actually making planes that I believe will be very hard to sell. In fact, the only ones they are getting rid of are those that are bartered for Malaysian rubber or for someone else's goods in some other part of the world. They are not actually selling any, and the skills that they are having to use are not Indonesian skills; they are having to bring in higher paid American and other overseas aircraft engineers and designers. They have spent millions of dollars on buying the latest technology, which has been left idle on the aircraft factory floor for 90 per cent of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project is obviously not working successfully, and<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">billions of dollars are going into this particular project while people are starving in the streets of the capital. As I understand it, some of the health budget was being appropriated to try to top up the funding for the aircraft project when I was there late last year. So I think we have to look very critically at where our aid goes because it seems to me that some of the countries that are major recipients are not necessarily spending that money wisely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago I was a member of the first Australian parliamentary delegation to go to Pakistan. Pakistan has got a population of about 100 million and the climate is pretty challenging. A fact of life about Pakistan is that it could not survive without outside help. Sixty-seven per cent of the population do not even go to primary school. Only four per cent of the country's forests are left. The natural resources are not there. There is tremendous poverty. The country suffers from environmental degradation and there are incredible education problems. It needs help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, again, one has got to look at how that help is directed, because Pakistan spends a huge amount of its national budget on defence. One of the earlier speakers, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), talked about India. There is no doubt that India and Pakistan have a problem over Kashmir and other things. They are both spending quite ridiculous amounts on defence, trying to develop nuclear capabilities, when there are millions in their own countries who need basic housing, health and educational facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a concern that much of our aid, however it goes out of this country, is not hitting the target. I interjected briefly, when one of the earlier speakers, the honourable member for Fraser, talked about the fact that there were projects which could be better managed, or do not do what they are aiming to do. I interjected that the same applies in this country, and that is so true, probably nowhere more specifically than with many of our Aboriginal projects, where we are not hitting the target when we should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those countries that I have talked about&mdash;whether Indonesia, Pakistan or Bangladesh&mdash;are massive compared with us in population, but certainly not in terms of their economies. We do have some obligation to help those countries. There is the issue of human rights, as was gone into at some length by the honourable gentleman from Curtin. Giving our aid through a third party is a very convenient cover for the government not to have to face up to the question of whether we help countries that have human rights records that we disapprove of. It seems to me that this is a cop-out. Having established that there is a need in many of these countries, but that the aid that is going there is not always being applied as it should, why should there be Australian involvement? Those present will probably infer from what I have said that I believe that, as we are a wealthy country and those countries are far from wealthy, we certainly need to give humanitarian aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to give aid as a good regional neighbour. For some years we have been saying that we are part of the Asia-Pacific region. We are not an Asian country, but we are located in the area, our future is very much tied up in that area, and we need to do the good neighbourly thing from time to time. At the moment, we get more back than we put in, in terms of the revenue to our companies, but the growth in the area will give much better opportunities for Australian companies in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are advantages of scale in giving aid through a third party, rather than necessarily tying it directly. As the honourable member for Fraser said, there is no question that for some of those projects the ADB is able to go out and generate more cash at cheaper interest rates. The reality is that the sheer scale of some of those projects means that we would not be able to fund them on a direct basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some reservations&mdash;many of them were well documented by the honourable member for Curtin. The problems of administration, and other difficulties that have been associated with the ADB, are well-known. Whilst there have obviously been some moves to address some of those issues, I am not convinced that they are being pursued with the vigour that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the question of whether bilateral aid would in fact do a better job. At least it would be more visible, so we would get the kudos and the credit. It would perhaps help our relationships with those countries which might at present perceive us as a geographically big and economically rich near neighbour which does not appear to be doing too much for them. If we were not paying the money through ADB, we could do it directly and we could get that kudos and benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly I think there are attractions about funding non-government organisations. On some of my trips in the last couple of years I have seen that some of the best work being done has undoubtedly been done through the non-government agencies. I have seen work with non-government agencies as well as government agencies in Indonesia and in Thailand, for example, and I believe there is no doubt that those NGOs give us more bang for our buck. I think that is something to be applauded. It seems to me that on bilateral aid we get the same sorts of benefits and probably fewer problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that we really do not have too much control about where the money that is channelled through ADB actually finishes up, so generally I would prefer to see bilateral aid. It seems to me that we get more value for our dollar, and it is therefore in the interests of both countries; but I recognise the need for some third party funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe that overall there are good reasons for being involved in the ADB, but I think we need to monitor its performance on an ongoing basis&mdash;and probably with more rigour than we have done hitherto. Australia has been committed to this exercise from the very start, and is a major player. It is appropriate that we should therefore take up the opportunity to increase our shareholding at this stage. As has been said previously, the coalition supports the bill in spite of its reservations; but were we in government we would want to look at the whole subject in a lot more detail and a with lot more substance, to make sure there are not better ways of helping those in the world who are less fortunate than ourselves. It is in our interests, as well as their interests, to see their lot improved. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill relates to a decision by the board of governors of the Asian Development Bank which increased the bank's authorised capital stock by 1,770,497 shares and authorised the acceptance of increases in individual members' subscriptions. The capital increase is one in which each member may subscribe to additional shares equal to its present subscription. Therefore, if all members subscribe fully, the capital of the bank will be doubled and the relative shareholdings of members will remain unaltered. This bill empowers the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to make the necessary agreement with the Asian Development Bank for the purchase by Australia of its entitlement of 2,047 additional paid-in shares and 100,323 additional callable shares of the capital stock of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's involvement in the issue of foreign aid is something that previous speakers have dwelled upon, and it is also one that I would like to speak about briefly today. Like the previous speakers, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)&mdash;and, no doubt, others&mdash;I am concerned about the level of foreign aid that the government is providing. I do not believe that we are doing as much as we should be in that area, and certainly within the government I have been one who has endeavoured to urge movement on the level of foreign aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our involvement in the Asian Development Bank is a form of foreign aid and, as has also been said by others, it is a cost-effective form of foreign aid. Through the processes of the bank, and through the fact that our capacity to contribute is there with the capacity of others, it provides a larger pool for investment purposes and therefore ensures more value for money with respect to its actual impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of what the role of the bank and foreign aid do for Australia, we have often talked in this place and in other places about the question of the need for the development of a greater regionalisation and internationalisation of the economy. Although many of us have concerns about how that has actually panned out, I think everyone agrees that there is a need for greater regionalisation of economic development in this area and that Australia has to play a key role in development within the region. As I have said, this is one way to do it, an effective way to do it and a way that should be encouraged. The benefits for Australia flow on from that. As the investments from the bank lead to improved trade and financial flows, they also lead to enhanced living standards from the resultant economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia participates actively in the work done by the projects. I have figures here from the bank's annual report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993, Australia's direct procurement with the ADB amounted to $108 million or 2.6 per cent of the total. During the five years 1989-93, Australia's procurement amounted to $432 million.</PARA>
<PARA>These are again major figures in terms of export benefits for Australian firms involved in the operations of the bank. When we are in a situation of assisting development within the region, an area where there are extremely high levels of poverty, starvation, disease and other difficulties, there is a capacity to assist in the development of regional stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a benefit through the processes of the Asian Development Bank in terms of regional security. Also, there is the question of our overall moral responsibility in alleviating poverty. The honourable member for Fraser mentioned that large parts of Asia are in a situation akin to Dickensian England with regard to the level of abject poverty and the desperation of the plight of the people who live there. That is also causing significant environmental dangers with respect to the sort of development that can occur and is occurring in parts of Asia. There are also questions of human rights. I do not pretend for one minute that the bank in itself is going to resolve all of these matters, but through its publications and through the investments that it makes it is assisting in addressing concerns on many of these issues, trying to lead Asia through to a more developed and, hopefully, environmentally friendly development approach for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier speakers have alluded to problems with the bank as they have been perceived over time. There have been a number of problems. The bank's administrative efficiency has been the object of some debate over the years. There are signs of improvement in that area. The questions of first-class air fares and the Rolls Royce approach of the bank have been addressed. Certainly Australia has been at the forefront of raising those concerns within the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question which is often raised about foreign aid is whether projects that are undertaken give value for money and whether they actually work. That is an issue of some debate. There are always examples of foreign aid not being successful in its objectives but there are also excellent examples of where it has been successful. The bank conducts post-evaluation processes for its projects and programs, and has provided an amount of useful data on that question. It uses this data in the formulation, design and implementation of new projects. The post-evaluation carried out in 1993 covered 26 projects, of which 16 projects were classified as generally successful, six projects as partly successful and four projects as unsuccessful, those being about 15 per cent of the activities in that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through those post-evaluation processes the bank has also identified the need to improve its performance in a range of areas. These include the need to provide greater assistance to borrowing countries in order to improve their administrative and institutional compatibilities in handling economic development tasks, to improve analysis of risks and uncertainties associated with bank projects, to incorporate measures of benefit monitoring and evaluation in the design of projects, and also to provide greater attention to maintenance requirements of projects once they are completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To many of us, all those things seem to be commonsense, but the bank is not the only organisation to make those types of errors. These processes and objectives must be continually maintained in the future to ensure that we get value for money and that the economy is assisted, through the work of the bank, to get value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank carried out an overall evaluation of approximately 425 projects up to the end of 1993, and this evaluation goes beyond the earlier evaluation which I spoke about. The view of the bank is that 60 per cent were generally successful, 29 per cent were partly successful and only 11 per cent were unsuccessful. As a scorecard regarding success, that is not a bad position to be in with the very difficult issues of trying to encourage and to make successful development projects in economies and areas that are, by definition, often the most difficult parts of the countries involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to Australia and the ADB, there are some issues raised in an article in the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and ADB: A Fact Sheet</EMPHASIS>, which details some of the aspects regarding Australia's involvement in the area. Australia is the fifth largest shareholder in the ADB. The ADB has a range of activities and there are various types of loans, grants, share schemes, et cetera involved. The ADB arranges co-financing from bilateral, multilateral and commercial sources as additional resources of the project financing. Co-financing in 1993 amounted to about $US3.5 billion for 24 loans and $US90 million for technical assistance grants. Cumulatively, ADB's co-financing amounted to $US18.6 billion for 398 loans and $US204 million for 297 technical assistance grants as of the end of September 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's involvement with this cumulative co-financing was 14 loans and three technical assistance grants, totalling $US38.3 million. In terms of bilateral loans, there were 11 loans, amounting to $US30.6 million. Those loans were co-financed for projects in countries such as the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga and Western Samoa. That information will give you a broad idea of the fact that the aid being provided through the bank and through Australia is being used throughout the region to provide worthwhile projects to areas which are in desperate need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I alluded earlier to the involvement of Australian companies in projects through the ADB, and the question of the projects providing a direct benefit to Australia in terms of export earnings. That question is worth looking at here today. With respect to Australia's involvement in that area, its share from January to September 1994 was $US30.4 million. In 1993 it was $US77.4 million, and there was a cumulative basis through to September 1994 of approximately $US554.4 million. It can be seen that we are talking about relatively large sums of money which have come back to Australia. As the honourable member for Aston mentioned, the figures show that Australian exports earned through this process actually exceed Australian investment within the bank. It is, therefore, a value for money investment for Australia in humanitarian terms, in regional terms and in terms of the firms which are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of contractors who are involved in this process: John Lysaght Ltd, just outside my electorate in Melbourne; L.M. Ericcson Pty Ltd, also in Melbourne, just outside my electorate on the other side; Hawker Noyes Pty Ltd; and Princess Shipping Ltd. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consulting firms are also actively involved in the processes of the ADB, and they have carried out significant work on behalf of the ADB in terms of the projects that they have undertaken. Some examples are: BHP Engineering; the Hawthorn Institute of Education; Stephenson and Turner; Gibb Australia; and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. We can see that, all the way through, there have been significant Australian firms involved in the development of ADB proposals and in construction in the countries which require it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When carrying out research for this speech, I looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ADB Review</EMPHASIS>, which is a publication of the Asian Development Bank, published on a two-monthly basis. That publication is worth looking at in terms of seeing the wide range of activities that the ADB is involved in. I am very impressed with the level of information in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ADB Review</EMPHASIS>, not only in terms of balance sheets and with respect to what investments are occurring where, but also with the articles which detail the impact of the projects that the ADB is carrying out, and the great need for those projects to occur across a range of countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to look at these publications in terms of this issue, and I would encourage anyone interested in the issue of foreign aid to look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ADB Review</EMPHASIS>, because it really does highlight the compassionate and the humanitarian aspects of foreign aid, and it puts faces and names to the debate, which I think is important in terms of recognising the real effect that these activities actually have in terms of people's living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the September-October 1994 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ADB Review</EMPHASIS>, there is an article on Bangladesh titled `Urban poverty: how bad is it?' A survey of 21 secondary towns in Bangladesh was undertaken to look at this issue and it came up with some very disturbing figures on what is happening in that country. The article read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The survey showed that 39 per cent of all sampled households fell below the poverty line. Roughly one third of the poor were hard core, living on the borderline of starvation. In the slum areas, nearly half the population were hard core poor. Fifty per cent of the adult urban poor were found to be illiterate. The rate was 61 per cent in the slum areas.</PARA>
<PARA>That article goes on to look at not only the question of the problems faced in Bangladesh on this issue, but also what the bank is endeavouring to do through its loan processes and through work with the government of Bangladesh and in conjunction with other governments to actually remedy some of those problems. It is an enormous task to try and achieve. Again I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since January 1989 it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the bank&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has provided Bangladesh with four loans totalling $213.7 million for the development of urban infrastructure. This makes the bank the largest among the donors to this sector, which include the World Bank, the United Nations Children's Fund and the governments of Japan and the Netherlands.</PARA>
<PARA>The infrastructure projects are involved with things like flood protection, water supply and sanitation. As we are all aware from watching the TV news, we often see at night pictures of natural disasters. I have noticed that they seem to be more and more often in the Asian area and they often relate to floods or typhoons. Certainly the danger of disease in those areas is very severe. It often relates to the question of sanitation. In this case there are projects which directly address those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a study in Asia on the impact of AIDS and the need to address that issue. There are also details on the question of population growth in that area, which I think is an issue which has also been a matter of some public debate in Australia. There are some very interesting statistics on the question of the population challenge we face across the world, but particularly in Asia. Three babies are born in the world every second, and two of those are actually in Asia. That means the growth in Asia's population each day is somewhere in the region of 150,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extremely large problem in terms of the difficulties that produces for governments and for communities in dealing with that increased population, and that creates enormous pressures on infrastructure services within countries. Can we imagine the situation if Melbourne or Sydney was growing at that rate in a situation where we did not have the infrastructure services already there? It would be a major national problem and something that would need to be addressed&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of family planning and maternal health care are a real problem in those areas, and I think these also relate to very important issues for women in those areas. As in any society, the major activities in terms of raising families fall to women. In situations where there are virtually no support services and a real lack of health and educational services, the difficulties are just phenomenal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank itself has supported Indonesia's development goals. Particularly in terms of Indonesia, we are looking at a situation where there has been a major effort to try to have public education programs to assist people to understand the issue of family planning, the need to be careful about the question of how many kids you can afford, and how you can, in a way, successfully manage your family. That program has been quite successful and over a billion dollars has gone from the bank into projects in that area. That, in itself, is crucial. I again quote the Director of ADB's Infrastructure Department, on this issue. Sayed Baha says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investing in women's education will result in high social gains and economic benefits. A better educated mother raises a healthier family and will have fewer but better educated children. Education provides women with greater employment opportunities and more income. These economic gains will motivate families to have less children, build demand for family planning services and lead to fertility decline.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not one who would endorse the draconian measures that have been used, as I understand it, in the PRC for population control, but I do think it is very important to have a situation where the people in these countries have the information to make their own choice about what they do with respect to their families. I also note from the publication that the major cause of death for women of child-bearing years is childbirth itself. It is an absolute tragedy that, in the very act of giving birth and giving life, so many should die. That childbirth is the major cause of death is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the environment, which I also mentioned earlier, is a major concern in terms of Asia. The fact is that in many respects the scope for rampant development and the lack of existing industries put Asian economies under enormous pressure to develop at almost any cost. I was very concerned to see in a recent study that Asia was predicted to become the largest future source in the world of greenhouse gas emissions. If unchecked, such emissions will warm up the climate enough to increase typhoons and cyclones and raise sea levels, thus causing increased flooding, erosion, damage to crops and, following on from that, starvation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join in this debate on behalf of the coalition. As has been indicated by prior coalition speakers, we are not opposing the Asian Development Bank (Additional Subscription) Bill 1994. Indeed, the former shadow minister for foreign affairs, the Hon. Andrew Peacock, last year expressed support for Australia to take up the additional share capital in the Asian Development Bank, which indeed is authorised by the bill currently before the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is in effect to make it possible for us to take out the additional subscription in capital to the Asian Development Bank, which was set up in 1966 to assist development programs and to assist in improving the standard of living in many countries of the Asia-Pacific. At the present time, there are 53 members. Some of those are, of course, countries in the region, and others are countries outside the region. Australia has always been a major player in the Asian Development Bank. Indeed, as far as we are concerned, the Asian Development Bank has been a major institution in our multilateral development program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADB provides loans, policy advice, equity finance and technical assistance to developing member countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Government spokesmen often say that Australia is part of Asia. I recently was part of a parliamentary delegation which had a bilateral visit to Singapore and Indonesia and also to the Philippines to attend the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference. It was really brought home to me during that visit how much Australia is part of the Asia-Pacific region and how we must learn to operate in our part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was, however, interesting to hear the comments made by a number of the parliamentarians from other countries, who thought that it was ridiculous for Australians to say that they are part of Asia. We are obviously not part of Asia, but of course we ought never to forget that we live in the Asia-Pacific region. To be credible in those countries, one must make credible statements and, when some of our government spokesmen say that Australia is an Asian nation, people from overseas just about fall off their chairs laughing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is important that Australia plays a role in the Asia-Pacific region. I have always known just how important that part of the world is to Australia. However, when I went to Asia and saw the development, the progress, the shared goals and common interests that we have with those countries, it brought home to me in a clear, compelling and concise way just how important that part of the world is to us. Thus I am very pleased that politicians on both sides of politics have taken a bipartisan approach to the Asia-Pacific region and to the importance that the Asia-Pacific region will play in the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capital currently available from the Asian Development Bank is of two kinds: pay-in capital and callable capital. The increase in capital involves the actual payment by members of the paid-in component and the potential liability for the callable component. The callable component of the bank's capital serves as collateral against which the bank borrows funds for on-lending. Fortunately, because the bank has been fairly well run over the years, the bank's loans have been financed largely by funds borrowed from international financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly from Australia's point of view&mdash;and, indeed, I imagine, from the point of view of the other investing countries&mdash;a call on the callable capital of the bank has never been made. This is because the bank's prudent financial policies and healthy level of reserves has meant that that has not happened in the past and it is unlikely to occur in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when we look at what this particular legislation is going to cost the country, we ought to look not only at what we must pay in the six annual instalments, but also at our potential liability. If there were some kind of international monetary catastrophe, Australia could well be called upon to pay out the full amount of its liability. It is very bad economics, where a certain amount of money has to be paid now and the rest does not have to be paid for quite some time, and maybe never, to disregard what could be the ultimate liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested in the fact that this is part of Australia's multilateral aid program. In the Australian community we have various competing strands of thought in relation to foreign aid. In a robust democracy such as Australia's, one would have to applaud the fact that we have differing views and we have contesting and competing ideas. I am sure that many people contact the electoral office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) and indeed all of our electoral offices and suggest that charity should begin at home and that, while many people in this country are in a state of poverty, Australia ought not to be shovelling money out the door to assist overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, Australians have a conscience and there are very many people who believe that Australia's international aid effort, up to the present time, may not have been adequate. I suppose that people on both sides of politics must try to straddle those two competing views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to read that Australia receives more benefit from its contributions than it pays out. I was concerned to see that the ADB loans are not tied and the recipients are not required to spend the aid in the country that provided it. We have all heard horrendous stories of how a nation gives a cash donation, for example, to buy tractors, and because the tractors produced by the donating nation are too expensive, the receiving nation then uses those dollars to shop around and get cheaper tractors. Thus I have always taken the view that, wherever possible, Australian aid ought to be in kind. For instance, if we are giving aid for food then we should send Australian wheat or some other Australian produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, those members who represent manufacturing electorates, like the Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, would understand how beneficial it would be to Australian industry if it were possible to include the goods that we have manufactured as part of Australia's aid projects. That way there is a win-win situation: the overseas country receives the aid and the Australian farmers and the Australian workers receive a benefit. We boost the economy of an overseas nation and improve its standard of living at the same time as we create jobs for Australian workers and Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that win-win situation ought to be applauded. It ought to be encouraged but I do accept that it is not possible to achieve that on every occasion. One would have expected that because the receiving country is not required to invest the aid received back in the donating country we might have been worse off; but I noticed that during the period from 1989 to 1993 Australia's procurement from ADB exceeded contributions by approximately $170 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major procurements from Australia by ADB cover goods, related services, civil works and consultancy services. I am pleased to see that Austrade helps with the effort to increase Australia's procurement. We have a full-time commissioner in Manila to promote Australian investment in ADB projects. I would hope that, if the situation occurred where the government saw that Australia was receiving less than its contributions, we might perhaps seek to change the rules to the extent that we tie our aid in a greater way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some overseas nations which do a much better job than Australia in seeking reciprocal benefit for aid given. Japan is one country which immediately comes to mind. Recently, as part of a parliamentary delegation, we visited a number of AIDAB projects in East Timor and also in the Philippines. I was pleased to see the reciprocal benefit that Australia is getting but I wonder whether we are doing enough in that area. We could always hose down those people who say that charity should begin at home if we could prove, and continue to prove in a very clear way, that there is benefit to Australia by giving overseas aid. We might even be able to provide more aid if we have an increased inflow of benefit to the Australian economy as a result of that particular aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is quite a short bill; it is only a page or two. The opposition does not oppose the bill. If we did oppose it, we would not be debating it this morning in the Main Committee. The bill specifically empowers the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to make the necessary agreement with the Asian Development Bank for the purchase by Australia of its entitlement of 2,047 additional paid-in shares and 100,323 additional callable shares of the capital stock of the bank. Australia currently holds 102,370 shares in the bank. Those shares are valued at $1.406 billion. That represents just over six per cent of the total capital subscribed in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of this figure, the amount that has already been paid to the bank is $168.8 million and the remaining $1.237 billion is subject to call. As I said before, as yet there has not been a call made on those balance funds and hopefully there will not be a call; but the government must always budget for the possibility that such a call could be made. The fact that Australia, a medium sized country, has six per cent of the capital of the Asian Development Bank indicates in a very clear way and sends a message to the world that Australia is shouldering its share of responsibility for boosting the living standards of people in the Asia-Pacific region. We are the fourth largest regional shareholder in the ADB and the fifth largest overall. Australia is a founding member of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition joins with the government in supporting the bill currently before the committee. The opposition does, indeed, have no concerns over the fact that Australia is increasing its capital in the bank. I do, of course, caution the government to always be aware that the callable shares could require a further financial input by Australia, although, fortuitously, such a thing has not occurred in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government, wherever possible, when looking at aid projects, to see whether we can boost the reciprocal benefit for Australia. Where we have a situation in which we benefit overseas countries, that is carrying out our humanitarian obligations. If as well, on the other hand, we can benefit ourselves&mdash;Australian farmers, Australian workers and Australian jobs&mdash;that will not do any harm to the receiving country, and will boost the benefits to this country. If we do that more and more, we will reduce the criticism that we have heard from the Australian community, from time to time, about foreign aid. If we can make foreign aid more palatable for people in Australia, governments of whatever colour will be able to make a greater contribution to relieving poverty and deprivation in other parts of the world. I support the bill on behalf of the coalition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various speakers in the debate have referred to the questions of aid: those concerning the volume of aid, and how best to package it together. One of the things that is notable about the Asian Development Bank is that it provides a whole raft of mechanisms to provide finance, essentially to the public sector, but also to a range of private sector projects in the region. I can recall meeting visiting officials from the bank in recent times, and talking to them about their strategic approach to these issues for the future and how they are determined to ensure they do have the right balance of focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Australia's point of view, the main thing to note about the additional contributions that we are appropriating through these provisions is that we need to see them not just in terms of their cost in dollar terms, but, rather, in terms of the investment which they can bring back to us. That has been very much the case. Of course, the strengthening of stability in the region through the activities of the Asian Development Bank has a direct economic benefit to Australia. If we get greater political and economic stability and growth in the region, Australian companies and the Australian people are beneficiaries as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that it is not feasible, as far as operations are concerned, to schedule pilots over 60 to fly only in the airspace of countries that do not apply the 60 years limit.
