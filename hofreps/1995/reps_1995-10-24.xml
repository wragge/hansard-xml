<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: National Film and Sound Archive headquarters accommodation, Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>The current accommodation used by the National Film and Sound Archive to house its administrative and specialist technical facilities is inadequate because it does not satisfy current occupational health and safety standards; because it uses original gallery space for office and technical accommodation, which is inconsistent with the building's heritage significance and limits the space available for public exhibitions; and because it includes demountable buildings which compromise the site's heritage significance and which are inconsistent with the intentions of the national capital plan. These inadequacies were recognised in the Commonwealth government's October 1994 Creative Nation policy statement, which announced that the government would provide the archive with funding to extend its accommodation facilities and to refurbish its heritage listed headquarters building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this initiative, it is proposed to construct a 3,800-square-metre building to the north-west of the existing headquarters building. The building will include office, technical, meeting and amenities areas, plant and services, a loading dock, pedestrian and service access links between the new building and the existing headquarters and associated site works, engineering services and landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, some modifications will be made to the existing car park. Additional on-site parking will provide for approximately 25 cars and five tourist coaches.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 22nd, 23rd and 24th reports of the committee for 1995 relating to the development of 1 Field Hospital, Holsworthy, New South Wales; the development of Ready Reserve (49 Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment and 6th Brigade Administrative Support Battalion) working accommodation, Enoggera, Queensland; and the provision of living-in accommodation at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS>, ACT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report I have tabled recommends the construction of a modern purpose-built field hospital for the Australian Army at Holsworthy to replace the existing inadequate medical facilities of 1 Field Hospital at Ingleburn in Sydney's west. The proposed hospital is required to support Australian Defence Force operations during a contingency, in accordance with the defence policy of self-reliance, as outlined in the 1994 defence white paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed facility will provide health care for regular Defence personnel located in the area known as the Liverpool Military Area, as well as army reserve personnel and visiting overseas military forces. The hospital will consist of a field component, and an Australian support area component which will continue to service those personnel who do not deploy when the field hospital deploys on operations. The facility is based on a 25-bed ward and a 16-bed self-care rehabilitation unit. The estimated cost when referred to the committee was $19.7 million at December 1994 prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In common with the defence forces of other developed nations, the Australian Defence Force provides medical and dental treatment to serving members; this is to maintain the highest standards of medical, dental and physical fitness. Such treatment is provided both in the field and in the barracks environment and ensures that members remain fit and available for operations. Field treatment for the Australian Army is provided by field hospitals such as 1 Field Hospital in Sydney and 2 Field Hospital in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the public hearing a proposal was put by the Southwestern Sydney Area Health Service that Defence should make use of facilities at the Liverpool Hospital. However, while the committee recognises the need for certain medical procedures to be performed at civilian hospitals, the committee agrees with the Department of Defence that operational requirements necessitate 1 Field Hospital possessing a wide range of medical capabilities. These include operating theatres, intensive care, pathology and radiology services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During its inquiry, earlier this year, into a replacement medical centre at RAAF Richmond the committee expressed concern at the high incidence of sporting injuries requiring treatment. While the committee recognised the need for service personnel to become and remain physically fit, it questioned whether this fitness was being achieved in the most efficient manner. At the Holsworthy hearing the sectional committee was informed by Defence that injuries resulting from either training or sporting activities were of concern to Defence and were currently being investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence advise it of the results of the study being undertaken of training and sporting injuries in the Australian Defence Force which require medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled recommends the construction of functional working accommodation for the ready reserve at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, Queensland at a cost of $21.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1991 the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) announced the ready reserve program. The ready reserve components were formed in the Australian Defence Force in 1992 as a means of increasing the ADF's capacity to deploy well-trained personnel in shorter time scales than conventional reserves. This implementation has increased the number of infantry battalions within Enoggera from two to three, without the provision of any new facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the ready reserve implementation relies on the ability of 49 Royal Queensland Regiment to be an operationally effective unit. 49 Royal Queensland Regiment occupies facilities dispersed over nine separate locations. The separate locations, lack of functionality, and in some cases inadequate size, detract from unit effectiveness and the effective utilisation of accommodation in Gallipoli Barracks. This also impacts on the morale of unit members as they can see that other battalions are better accommodated than 49 RQR. The unit layout as it now exists leads to inefficiencies in control, administration and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Construction of the proposed facilities will redress significant shortfalls existing in accommodation of 49 Royal Queensland Regiment at Enoggera. However, should there be a change in policy in relation to the retention or the role of the ready reserve, the facilities would be adaptable for use by other units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has always been concerned with energy conservation measures. Therefore, the committee requires the Department of Defence to undertake, as soon as possible, an energy audit to assess the efficiency of the existing energy management system at Enoggera Barracks. The committee further requires the Department of Defence to make available to it the consultants' examination of energy consumption costs for this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third report which I have tabled involves the provision of living-in accommodation at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> here in the ACT. This proposal will provide an increase in the current living-in accommodation on the base from 232 personnel to a total of 428. It will replace existing unsuitable and substandard accommodation for 54 personnel. The committee has recommended that this proposal, which will cost $18.3 million, should proceed. It is proposed that construction will commence in January 1996 with completion in late 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major function of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> is to provide accommodation and messing for personnel working on the base and naval personnel serving in the Canberra area. The committee has concluded that there is a lack of suitable available living-in accommodation at HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Harman</EMPHASIS> which has resulted in the base having one of the highest allowance costs of any naval establishment. Alternatives examined aimed at reducing allowance costs have indicated that the provision of additional living-in accommodation at HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Harman</EMPHASIS> is the most cost-effective solution due to the well developed infrastructure, adequate land, location and lower capital and recurrent costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that the location and extent of the proposed development at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> conforms with zone planning and will address immediate accommodation, messing and recreational requirements. The report recommends that the Department of Defence undertake a study of the use of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harman</EMPHASIS> as a possible triservice centre of living-in accommodation for single Defence personnel working in the Canberra area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also canvasses the impact of aircraft noise on the base and the need for the scope of the project to be extended to provide a new formal entrance to the base. It also recommends further study of the practicalities of using grey water to irrigate the playing fields and the landscaping. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Employment Services Amendment Bill 1995 provides an opportunity to look at the government's employment strategy and at what a total disarray and a shocking state of affairs it is in. Every time a bill  on employment is introduced in this House, the government continues to make changes. It has no clear strategy for dealing with the problems of unemployment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Act 1994 established the case management system and the Employment Services Regulatory Authority as an independent statutory authority responsible for regulating the case management system. The bill makes machinery changes arising from changed case management arrangements for certain part-time and seasonal workers. It will also streamline certain administrative procedures relating to the CES notification requirements and allow ESRA, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, to obtain goods and services by using a credit card. I hope they use it wisely, Mr Speaker, because, as you would be well aware, credit cards have created a bit of a problem for the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also allows for consequential amendments arising from proposed changes to the Social Security Act 1991 that would amalgamate the jobsearch allowance and the newstart allowance. Here is another change. It would also amend the Social Security Act 1991 to provide for the national convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want particularly to address the House's attention to the job compact, which shows the government's lack of strategy and the disarray and disorder that it is in. Job compact eligibility for certain seasonal and part-time workers is being amended by the bill. The definition of persons eligible for the job compact is being amended to include the requirement that, in addition to having been in receipt of the jobsearch, newstart or youth training allowance for a period of 18 months, a person must have been registered with the CES for a period of 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On seasonally adjusted figures as at 18 October 1995, long-term unemployment&mdash;that is, anyone who has been unemployed for 18 months or more&mdash;increased in Australia by 6,600 persons in the last month. That is 6,600 people in one month added to the long-term unemployed, making a total of 237,700 people&mdash;almost a quarter of a million people&mdash;in the Australian community who are long-term unemployed. Those people have been unemployed for 18 months or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's strategy is this: you have to be out of work for 18 months in order to get a job for 13 or 26 weeks. After that you can then join the bottom of the queue and become unemployed for 18 months again. I repeat that because the minister at the table, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), is hanging his head in shame&mdash;so he should. The government's strategy under the job compact is that you have to be out of work for 18 months, so that you then get a job for 13 or 26 weeks, so that then you can join the bottom of the queue&mdash;a queue of 237,700 which becomes 237,701&mdash;and become unemployed for 18 months again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The queue of the long-term unemployed people has blown out in the last month by 6,600. The total unemployment figure for the month is another indictment of the government's disarray on employment strategy. As at 12 October 1995, the number of unemployed people rose by 9,900 to a total of 763,100 unemployed people in Australia. It is disastrous news for Australia that, in just one month, another 9,900 people have been added to the unemployment queue to boost the unemployed figure to 763,100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister at the table would understand this because he does follow Australian Rules football. That figure of 763,100 is eight times the number of people at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for an AFL grand final. Eight times the number of people at the MCG for the AFL grand final in Australia are unemployed. What a disgraceful episode this government has entered into. What you have done is absolutely diabolical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister, if you were going to pursue a strategy, one would have thought you could have come up with something better than the one I have just read out to you&mdash;because that is what the job compact does. All that the government's priority and strategy intend to do is to remove people from the unemployment figures without really getting them a job. You take unemployed people off the figures and manipulate the system in whatever way you can in an attempt to reduce the numbers that make up the unemployment statistics. It does not matter if you recategorise those people, change or rename the system or amalgamate jobstart and newstart. All those things purely and simply are being done by the government in order to manipulate the figures and make it appear as though unemployment in this country is lessening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But those figures really do not tell the full story of unemployment. The latest figures&mdash;and I have just read them to the House&mdash;of about 763,100 people being without jobs simply do not tell the real story of unemployment. There are many people, in my own area of Bendigo in particular, where the regional unemployment figures have almost doubled just over the last five years. I repeat: those figures have almost doubled just over the past five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the jobs that have been created under some of these schemes, such as the jobs compact and a number of others, are part-time jobs of short duration. All that those jobs do is to take unemployed people off the numbers on the list of unemployed; those people then go on to a short-term part-time job and, of course, the general public then looks at the unemployment figure and it appears as though the government is doing something about it. But the real fact is that the unemployment figures in my area have doubled in the last five years, and in many other parts of Australia there is a similar situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are many more facets to unemployment. Many people in the community want to work more hours. They are working part time, a few hours through the week, and they do not appear on the unemployment figures. There are many people who are seeking the opportunity to do more work, more hours. But they are unable to find the opportunity to do additional work because of the government's economic problems and its mismanagement of the unemployment strategy. It is quite clear to me that, with 153 jobs lost in Bendigo itself over the past three months, the policies of the Keating government are simply not working and it does not have the strategy in place to deal with the country's level of high unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of youth unemployment is another matter again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be condemned for its strategy and its economic mismanagement when you see headlines such as `Jobless state's worst' which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 21 September 1995. The article below that headline states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bendigo region has the highest youth unemployment rate in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics the Loddon-Campaspe-Mallee region, of which Bendigo is a part, had a youth unemployment rate of 29.4 per cent in August this year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, in August 1995 almost 30 per cent of youth in the Bendigo region were unemployed. That any government could create this problem by its economic mismanagement and then continue to oversee it is a disgrace. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ABS spokesman said the bureau's labour force survey showed there were 5500 youths looking for full-time work in the Loddon-Campaspe-Mallee region in August this year.</PARA>
<PARA>Those 5,500 young people have aspirations and ambitions: they want to get out and work; they want to create some employment opportunities for themselves to have long-term security; and they want to develop a career that will stand them in good stead. But the mismanagement of the Australian economy by the Keating government has meant that that region&mdash;the Bendigo region in the Loddon-Campaspe-Mallee region&mdash;has seen youth unemployment increase up to almost 30 per cent during the August period of this year. So there are 5,500 young people without the opportunity to get a full-time job in that area. That is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the acting regional manager of the Commonwealth Employment Service said that his department was giving top priority to tackling youth unemployment in the Bendigo region. I know that the CES&mdash;and I respect the acting regional manager&mdash;are trying hard to do it, but they can only do what is within the government's strategy. They are issued with instructions on how they can handle unemployment and they have to work within those confines. They cannot make policy changes. Those policy changes come direct from the government, and if the government has the wrong policies in place, no matter how hard the Commonwealth Employment Service try to place those young people, they will not be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acting regional manager&mdash;and I will not quote his name&mdash;said that four new case managers had been appointed to give assistance to youths and school leavers looking for jobs. He said, `We are aware the problem exists in the community, and we want to see it reduced.' He said that the situation would improve in coming months as 100 jobs would be available through the Landcare employment assistance program. That is 100 jobs to address a problem of 5,500 youths out of work. It is hardly a drop in the bucket. Yet that is about all that is becoming available. Other developments are occurring in the Bendigo area and, hopefully, there will be some jobs as a result of those developments which include a new Big W and a Safeway store which will be opening at the Bendigo marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the problem goes way beyond 100 positions in those sorts of areas. We are looking at a major problem and a major gap in the government strategy, where all they do is continue to change the programs, call them different names, restructure them, and take people on and off the unemployment list in a cold and callous way which really has no regard for the future of young people and their chance of finding a permanent long-term job and a permanent long-term career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that was never highlighted more than when I asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in the House about youth unemployment problems and how the Keating government had failed Bendigo. I also asked him about his strategy. He did admit that the government had problems with teenage unemployment and that Working Nation was deficient. Here we see another opportunity for the government to bring forward a bill, yet it is fiddling at the edges without really addressing the major problem facing this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Crean also said that a new employment scheme would be introduced before the 1996 election campaign to help unemployed youths. That is really what it is all about. That is precisely what the minister said, that they had put another strategy in place&mdash;a new employment scheme&mdash;that they would use to fiddle at the edges and try to reduce the numbers on the unemployed list so that they can go to the election in 1996 and say, `Aren't we great fellows? We've got our economic strategy and our employment strategy in place, and we've started to reduce the numbers on the unemployment list. We will be able to go out and hold our heads high in that campaign in 1996.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying figures are not good. In fact, as I indicated to the House, there are thousands and thousands of people&mdash;up to 1 1/2 million&mdash;in Australia who want to work more hours. They want to be productive, but the government's strategy and economic management policies do not allow it. These people would be very happy to do some more work. Some of them who are doing only a few hours work per week are looking for the opportunity to make a major contribution to the wellbeing and the economic prospects of this nation. But, under the present structure which deals with unemployment, the government are simply not interested in that at all. What they are interested in is manipulating the unemployment figures to make them look good to the general public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 12 October 1995 which reads `Jobs crisis still critical: figures tell sorry story'. This article refers to the total number of unemployed people. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bendigo's jobless rate remains extremely high despite record new job creation.</PARA>
<PARA>This `record new job creation' relates to what the government claim to be around 1,000 new jobs. I am still quite interested to find out where those 1,000 jobs have come from, but I can assure the House that they are not long-term jobs. Most of them will be either for 13 weeks or 26 weeks. I refer to the Bendigo jobs figures which were published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. The article lists the number of unemployed in the June quarter. In 1990 there were 3,911 people unemployed and in 1994 there were 8,903 people unemployed. In just 4 1/2 years, the figure increased to 8,903, which is double the 1990 figure of 3,911. Regrettably, the jobless rate at the June quarter in 1990 was 6.3 per cent and in 1994 was 14.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can understand the frustration faced by young people in my area who cannot get a full-time permanent job and who cannot find career prospects. The government are not interested in dealing with that problem. They have the wrong economic policies in place. They do not offer unemployed people long-term prospects. They are interested only in reducing the number of people on the unemployment list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES, as I indicated earlier, are desperately trying to help these young people. They have recently appointed four case managers, but those case managers are going to have to try to find jobs for 500 youths. Those four case managers will each have to try to find a job for about 125 young people. That is a huge task in terms of case management. That is precisely what this bill before us does: it deals with the role of case managers and the activities that they will pursue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Employment Services Amendment Bill 1995 following the comments of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who has been a longstanding advocate for the interests of young unemployed people in his electorate. It is something that I know is very close to his heart. Like him, in my electorate we have a large number of young unemployed people who many would consider, looking at the government's legislative record and its record in government since 1983, to be the forgotten Australians. They are forgotten because not only are their interests ignored by the Australian government but also they are treated in a way which is fraudulent and misleading. They are shuffled from one scheme to another in order to satisfy the government's interest in manipulating the unemployment figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would have heard yesterday in question time, amongst the vitriol levelled at members of the opposition by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was an accusation to one of the members of the front bench that he was a ghost. I put it to the government that the real ghosts in Australia are the long-term unemployed, who are effectively being moved from one scheme to another to avoid the inevitable conclusion that the community in many cases has already made, which is that unemployment in Australia is a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear the comments of a person who at one time was lauded by the Australian government and at another time is being derided by the Australian Prime Minister: media magnate Rupert Murdoch. He commented on the Australian economy. Rupert Murdoch has made what I think are very telling comments at a time when many government members are trying to not only mislead themselves but also, more importantly, defraud the community in trying to convince them that the economy is operating successfully and we are making the best possible use of our natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Murdoch made a most telling point when he said that the Australian economy is a disgrace. I would have to agree, as many others in the community would, particularly those who are in any way connected with trying to create wealth in this nation, such as those in small, medium or large businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He observed that the economy was a disgrace. I am sure that members of the government, even the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), would agree that Mr Murdoch is an expert on economic developments. He has had a longstanding observer role in relation to Australia, notwithstanding the fact that he has gone to the United States. His other comment, which was of a far more serious nature, was about youth unemployment. In real terms, young people in this country are carrying the burden of up to 35 per cent unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one were to look at the real changes between 1983 and 1995, one would find that probably the most disturbing of them is the decline in the standard of living across the community to the key sector of young Australians. Young Australians, particularly those in 1983 who were unable to vote or have any say whatsoever in the election of the Australian government, have been placed in the position where, in order to compensate for the economic mismanagement of the previous 12 years, they are obliged to cop 35 per cent unemployment. In other words, they have suffered a far more serious decline in their standard of living to accommodate the increase in our national debt and the essential decrease in employment opportunities in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably one of the great tragedies of our time that we have effectively asked young people to cop that burden without giving them the opportunity to have any say in the matter. Many young people who are suffering from unemployment of those proportions are unable to vote; they are not yet old enough to vote. Many long-term unemployed young people were unable to vote at the last federal election. A large proportion of them would certainly not have been in a position to participate in the 1990 federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, young people have seen the federal government of Australia squander their opportunities to enjoy what most of us take for granted as part and parcel of the Australian standard of living, Australian life or what has been known colloquially as the Australian dream: the opportunity of employment, of some security, of making career advancements in one's working life, of being able to buy one's own home, of being able to get married and then raise a family in relative economic security and of being able to save and look forward to providing for one's own retirement. In all these cases, young people in particular have the worst possible prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cover of this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> mentions a story about vandalism to people's motor vehicles. It is interesting that the article outlines observations which were made about why young people in particular vandalise the motor vehicles of other people in the community, particularly those that are probably of a little more value, or expensive motor vehicles. Often it is because of jealousy or the anger and frustration of young people who are unable to look forward to or aspire to owning property or things of that value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find ourselves in a nation where a significant proportion of our community feel alienated from not only the opportunities that most of us, particularly my generation, have taken for granted but the opportunity of being able to influence the way in which this country is heading. In looking at all the things that we can do for young people as we move towards the next federal election, surely the most important, the most fundamental, is giving them a vision, a prospect, for a future in which they will be able to enjoy what we have had and what many of us have taken for granted over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer, a person who shares an electorate like mine with a large number of young people&mdash;particularly between the ages of five to 15 and a large proportion of people between 15 and 24&mdash;would know only too well that many of his constituents contact him and his office and deplore the situation, the circumstances, in which their youngsters find themselves today. He and I share the same problems in our electorates because they have very similar demographic make-ups, as he well knows. Yet he, as part of this government, has participated in what is essentially a grand fraud perpetrated on the very people who are least in the position of being able to either detect it or defend themselves against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find ourselves today debating the Employment Services Amendment Bill, in which a number of amendments are being proposed to the Employment Services Act, which was created to provide, as part of the so-called Working Nation document, opportunities for case management of the cases of long-term unemployed people. But, before I debate some of the amendments, I would like to make a couple of observations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bendigo observed that the statistical evidence is that the number of long-term unemployed is increasing in this country&mdash;a matter of grave concern for all of us involved in public policy making. In the case of my electorate, use of statistics in relation to unemployment has become almost an art form. It has become an art form because the government has been using scheme after scheme to conceal the real unemployed in our nation. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) often has the gall to stand up in question time and brag about how his government and his policies have been responsible for reducing unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming from these statistics are a number of other side issues. It is interesting to note that in the budget brought down in 1992 the then Minister for Local Government, Mr Simmons, introduced a local capital works program in which around $24 million&mdash;it may have been a bit more than that&mdash;was divided up between the various local government regions around Australia for use in employment creation programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer sitting at the table today well knows that that was a grand plan devised to funnel valuable funds into marginal Labor seats to help the sitting members get re-elected. One of those seats was the city of Canning. So he was the beneficiary of essentially a grossly disproportionate share of that money compared with other areas in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in my case in the seat of Moore we got nothing, absolutely zilch, out of a program that was designed to create jobs for the long-term unemployed through local government authorities, which in real terms could well have been a quite laudable objective. However, we could see the base nature of the way in which it was devised, the method of operation used to divide that money. We saw, quite clearly, that it was yet another opportunity for the federal government to send taxpayers' funds to help their sitting members get re-elected, which unfortunately they did at the ensuing election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that the reason this system was seen to have been base and motivated by purely political objectives was that in Moore, despite the fact that there were 8,500 unemployed people, we saw local government in the city of Wanneroo get absolutely nothing&mdash;zilch, zero. Yet in Canning, which had fewer unemployed than the city of Stirling, there was about $5 million expended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is fascinating that the Assistant Treasurer intervenes. He well knows&mdash;although he smiles and treats it lightheartedly&mdash;that in essence this was a grand scheme to pass on taxpayers' money, to get more public funding to help get Labor re-elected in the marginal seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk about another example where the statistics that are manipulated by this government are then used to deprive people of funds or resources to which they would otherwise be entitled. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in this case, because of the way in which that local capital works program was organised&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that the city of Stirling and the city of Wanneroo virtually had almost identical numbers of unemployed&mdash;we found ourselves in the ridiculous situation where the city of Stirling got $7 million because of a slight variation on notional figures, not real figures, and the city of Wanneroo got nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notional nature of the break-up of these figures is even more ridiculous when you consider that the breakdown of the figures came from the same two DSS centres that were used by people living in the city of Stirling&mdash;Mirrabooka and Innaloo. So we have the ridiculous situation where the figures were notional and broken down by the very same places. By a sleight of hand, the city of Stirling&mdash;which is in a marginal seat which fortunately fell nonetheless to the Liberal Party, to the current sitting member&mdash;got that $7 million, and the people who deserved it, the people of the city of Wanneroo, saw it slip away and not be shared adequately or fairly between them and the people in the city of Stirling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate&mdash;in fact, throughout the nation&mdash;we have a Commonwealth emergency relief program which is based on unemployment levels. We have the quite ludicrous prospect whereby, as these schemes artificially reduce unemployment levels in the various regions and districts around the nation, other schemes, that have been set up by the federal Labor government that essentially are tagged or related to unemployment figures, are suddenly losing money. My electorate and the electorate of the member for Canning share the same demographic features; there is a concentration of families raising children. Because of the sleight of hand used in shuffling people around under these employment schemes, I suddenly find that my electorate is copping a decline in its emergency relief program allocations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, that means that in Western Australia overall there has been a decrease of almost half a million dollars. These decreases in emergency relief programs impact on real people&mdash;people who need assistance, particularly people raising families, raising young Australians. Here we find a cruel twist of fate where the government, anxious to show itself in a better light for its prospects at the next federal election, manipulates unemployment figures. By a sleight of hand it shows an alleged reduction in unemployment figures. It is then able to reduce other benefits and the devotion of resources to the very same people who are nonetheless copping the same or similar levels of unemployment, notwithstanding these so-called employment schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at this particular bill and the consequences of it. I suppose one of the first observations you would have to make about it is that it helped set up the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. I do not know the other people on it&mdash;I am sure they are very worthy people&mdash;but I could not quite understand how on earth this government in its right mind could have appointed Joan Kirner as the authority's chairperson. Of all the people in the country you would try to avoid appointing to a serious position like this, she would have to be one of the first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you looked at the performance of the Kirner Labor government in Victoria you would see that it was alongside that of the Burke, Dowding and Lawrence governments, Labor administrations, of the Assistant Treasurer's own home state. It was one of the most incompetent, worst, most useless, most destructive governments that we have seen in recent modern Australian history. When you look at what occurred during Joan Kirner's stewardship as the Premier of that state&mdash;the decimation of Victorian industry and the unemployment caused by the net effect of her spendthrift economic policies&mdash;you have to concede that she was the last person who should have been appointed to this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, we have another instance of jobs for the boys and girls. It was interesting to see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> yesterday a nice succinct summary of all the people who have been beneficiaries of largess from the Australian Labor government. Of course, a number of them are former Labor ministers or Labor Party apparatchiks. Isn't that a coincidence? Isn't it strange that they all seem to drift from parliament and straight into sinecures where the Australian Labor government, the Australian Labor Party, looks after its own and provides them with a nice income?

Because the solutions to the problems raised by the Auditor-General would require a little more thought and a little more concentration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Employment Services Amendment Bill 1995 is typical of the government's approach to solving the unemployment problem. It is tinkering around the edges without addressing the root causes of what is a very serious problem for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes to amend the Employment Services Act 1994 in four ways: first, it provides for the Commonwealth Employment Service to issue a notice to participants in the case management scheme only when they are required to come in for a referral interview; secondly, it will change the job compact eligibility requirements for certain seasonal and part-time workers; thirdly, the bill would enable the Employment Services Regulatory Authority&mdash;ESRA&mdash;to obtain goods and services on credit by the use of a credit card; and fourthly, the bill makes consequential amendments upon the amalgamation of the jobsearch allowance and the newstart allowance into one allowance type. The bill would also amend the Social Security Act 1994 to provide for the national convenor of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to delegate his or her powers under the Employment Services Act 1994. None of those proposals is earth-shattering or likely to have a major impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of the case management scheme was examined by the Auditor-General in Audit Report No. 3 of 1995-96 which was released in September. The report was based on visits to the offices of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, interviews with DEET staff, and a survey of clients using case management. The report was tabled on 21 September and this bill was then introduced on 27 September last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not address the recommendations of the Auditor-General's report. Given the nature of the recommendations, this is most unsatisfactory. The Auditor-General found that, given the time and other constraints involved, the implementation of case management has been reasonably well managed. But the Auditor-General also found that 39 per cent of clients were not even aware that there was a return to work plan developed for them. This plan is an essential feature of case management and failure to comply with the plan may result in benefits being suspended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General also found that 43 per cent of clients were of the opinion that their motivation to find work had not altered due to case management. Consequently, the report made a number of recommendations. One of the major recommendations was that, when contacting clients regarding case management, the purpose of the interview and a contact name and number should be provided. It was also recommended that the purpose, obligations and goals of the agreement be clearly explained to each client. The report recommended that guidelines be improved to ensure that case managers have an indication of the level and extent of services to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that it would have been worth while for the government to examine the Auditor-General's report and to delay the introduction of this bill to allow it to incorporate its response to the report into the bill. That would at least have been some attempt to address what are recognised by an independent body to be defects in the government's case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several substantial aspects of the unemployment problem that require a serious, intelligent and caring approach by a government determined to reduce the numbers of those out of work. This government has not shown that it is capable of delivering any such solution. This is particularly disturbing to Australians because one of the most serious aspects of unemployment is the very high rate of youth unemployment. And most shamefully, instead of trying to solve the problem of youth unemployment, the government has been trying to hide the extent of the problem by stopping the publication of regional youth unemployment figures and by redefining youth unemployment away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just two months ago DEET stopped publishing the regional youth unemployment figures. The most recent of these figures show teenage full-time unemployment at 21.5 per cent in south-west Perth, 27.7 per cent in central Perth, 18.1 per cent in north Perth and 22.2 per cent in regional Western Australia outside the lower west of the state. These figures mean that about one in four young people in Western Australia who are seeking work are unable to find it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 12 months to August 1995 there was an increase of almost 10 per cent in the number of teenage males looking for full-time work. The failure of the government's so-called Working Nation program is its failure to help young people obtain work. The target for the jobstart program was undershot by 90,000 places last year. This was a failure which had a direct impact on young people. As further evidence of the government's failure, apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force are at their lowest for 30 years. One can only speculate as to what the impact of that will be on the ability to provide a skilled work force in future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition takes no joy in these depressing results. Our aim is to see young people who are seeking work find satisfactory jobs that will last and that will provide them with a valued place in the work force. This government is offering nothing of substance to the young unemployed. It perhaps can offer some place in the labour market program, but it is not offering enough genuine jobs. Unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular, is one of the most serious problems facing Australia today. It is devastating for the individuals involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth unemployment can generate a loss of motivation in the unemployed person and, as a result, threatens to destroy confidence and hope in our society amongst a whole generation. These young people are more likely to suffer loss of self-esteem the longer their inability to find work persists. They are more likely to be victims of violence in the streets and they are more likely to be drawn into drugs and crime. If they are young men, especially young men living in rural areas, they are more likely to commit suicide. While the overall level of suicide in Australia has not increased for decades, the victims of suicide have shifted from amongst the old to amongst the young. While there are many causes of the depression that can lead to suicide, unemployment is a key cause among young men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has tried to solve the youth unemployment problem by redefining it. It has said that an increasingly large proportion of young people are in continuing education or training and that unemployed young people as a proportion of the total age group are a relatively low proportion. This is dissembling. Unemployment among no other age group is defined as a proportion of the age group. It is always defined as a proportion of those in the labour market. This should be the case for young people as well. To do otherwise is to imply that young people do not have the same rights to unemployment as older people and that it is somehow exceptional and unsatisfactory for them to be seeking work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people do want work. While the participation rate is less for teenagers than for older age groups, it is still at 57.1 per cent. In July this year there were more teenagers in the labour force than not. Of those in the labour force, 230,000 were employed full time and 355,000 part time. Many of those employed part time are at school or at a tertiary institution and many of those employed full time are in part-time education or training. The problem is that the demand for paid work among young people is much greater than the supply. This meant that, sadly, in July this year there were 267,300 young people aged between 15 and 24 looking for work and unable to find it. This meant an overall unemployment rate among teenagers of almost 20 per cent. Among those aged 15 to 19 years looking for full-time work, the unemployment rate was 26.5 per cent. Many of these young people seeking work had been unemployed for over a year. The coalition does not accept that there will never be jobs for these young people. We believe that by appropriate policies job opportunities can be provided for these young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These young people lacking employment are not limited to those who are untrained or unskilled. Some seeking work have tertiary qualifications in fields in which they are unable to find employment. Even postgraduate qualifications will sometimes not get a young person a job. The unemployment figures themselves do not, of course, reveal the extent of employment of qualified people in jobs for which their qualifications are not required, there being no relevant jobs in the field in which they have obtained the qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most jobs in Australia are provided by small and medium sized businesses and it is important that we stimulate the rate of job creation among those businesses. The sorts of jobs which are missing include those in competitive export industries which, for a range of reasons, seem not to have come into existence. There is no mystery about why jobs are not being created. The Australian economy has for years been constricted by badly conceived labour market regulation, by an incredibly complex tax system with very high compliance costs, by a lack of confidence that governments will control inflation, by the lack of an enterprise and export culture, by one of the largest and most costly government enterprise sectors in the Western world and by one of the smallest vocational education and workplace based training sectors in the industrialised world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies needed are those which ensure that smaller businesses have the confidence to invest and expand. The right policies are those which secure a low interest rate environment, which greatly reduce the compliance costs associated with complex taxes such as the fringe benefits tax, which reduce the onerous paperwork burden and excessive regulation and which allow proper flexibility in determining relationships in the workplace. These are policies which a Howard government would introduce as a matter of priority but which have been absent under the Labor government in recent years. Without these sorts of policies, all other policies and programs designed to support the employment of young people will have little impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second essential feature of a successful employment policy for young people is that it must expand opportunities and incentives for on-the-job as well as off-the-job training. Where there is no paid work available to provide a basis for training, the coalition believes that it should be acceptable for an unemployed person to use any voluntary or community work in which they are engaged as part of their satisfaction of the activity test. This sort of work is beneficial to the community and to the individual. It provides the unemployed person with job skills and contacts and helps foster self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, training programs could be improved by making them more local. I know from talking to concerned people in my own electorate that there is a lot of goodwill at the community and regional levels to address the problem of unemployment among young people. In response to the problems young unemployed people are facing, there have been many creative and innovative schemes developed in communities and by agencies in recent years. Unfortunately, many of these have been stifled because they do not comply with DEET guidelines for Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will establish a community employment program with structures which will give much more independence and authority to communities and regions to ensure that effective programs are funded. This means that guidelines should be flexible. The rigid age requirements for some existing programs have often meant that help has been denied to young people who could benefit from it. The coalition will place more weight on getting young people into jobs at the end of training programs, in contrast with the Labor government's focus on getting people off the unemployment statistics and into training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last weekend the Deputy Prime Minister, the absconding member for Swan (Mr Beazley), launched an advertisement in Western Australia which falsely stated that under a Howard government things would get worse for working people. A part of the intended implication of the advertisement is that under the Howard Liberal government school leavers would be on a youth wage of less than $3.17 an hour. This is simply not true. The coalition is not taking any state based industrial relations reforms as its model, contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister would like the public to believe. Our policy at the last election to introduce a youth wage has been long abandoned. It will not be revived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) made it quite clear on a previous occasion that the coalition will not revise the government's training wage traineeship to disadvantage trainees. The training wage has been established under a national award and the coalition has made it clear that the award levels&mdash;and we are committed to retaining the award system&mdash;will provide the minima in relation to wage levels. This Labor advertisement is simply a Labor lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the government must stop sweeping the problem of youth unemployment under the carpet. The government must stop its deceitful scare campaign based on untruths about what a coalition government will do after the next election. This bill does not address the problem&mdash;it is an ineffectual tinkering around the edges of the case management system. The government should at the very least respond to the concerns raised by the Auditor-General in his report. Youth unemployment is an area where the coalition would be only too pleased if the government stole our policy ideas. The situation continues to be of tragic proportions and continues to require an immediate response. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am pleased to be able to sum up in this debate and put to rest some of the assertions which have been made by opposition members in the course of it. Before addressing issues raised by the shadow spokesperson, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), I would like to deal with a couple of matters raised by the member for Tangney (Mr Williams). He said towards the conclusion of his speech that the opposition would introduce a new employment program called the community employment program, which would have greater flexibility. I do not know what he means by that. Greater flexibility than what? He clearly does not understand the nature or the range of present labour market programs that are in operation, or the flexibility that is allowed in determining how they operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am somewhat surprised at that because what the member should know, if he were on top of the subject, is that a key to the labour market program development over the course of Working Nation thus far has been a dramatic increase in flexibility, substantial improvements in the way in which programs have been delivered and the fact that regional priorities are given great prominence. There are some 61 area consultative committees around Australia which have an increasing role in determining which programs will be run within those regions and how they will operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area that the member ought to be aware of is that of new work opportunities. In fact, in some places, area consultative committees are determining which new work opportunities should be approved and which should not be approved. That is important, because it demonstrates that the opposition does not understand not only the comprehensiveness of our policy programs and the labour market program initiatives but also how they operate or the connection between the various elements of Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not understand the roles of area consultative committees. It does not understand how the area consultative committees relate to the Commonwealth Employment Service. It does not understand how the area consultative committees have a role in determining which programs will operate and what priorities will be given to programs within the region, particularly in the area of new work opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member clearly does not understand the emphasis which has been placed on traineeships by this government and the fact that we are after longer term employment outcomes. He does not understand, nor does he appreciate, I think, the success rate of our programs to date in achieving those objectives. If he did, he would at least acknowledge that we have created some 655,000 new jobs and that there has been quite a dramatic, yet not sufficient, drop in unemployment from 11.2 per cent to 8.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to be beyond the opposition to recognise the elements of Working Nation, how they knit together and what their impact has been on the Australian community. I will come back to the assertions by the member for Tangney a little later on regarding some other aspects of the way in which government policies have been introduced. What he said replicates, in a sense, what has been said by other speakers, particularly the shadow spokesperson, the member for Goldstein. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theme running through the speeches by the opposition has been largely that case management is not working. In fact, the Working Nation programs, of which case management is a part, have been an outstanding success in their first year of operation. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) stated in the House last week, the message of Working Nation is that this government has a clear strategy for getting unemployment down&mdash;a strategy which, as I said, is not understood or appreciated by our opponents. He said that the message is very clear. Our objective is five per cent unemployment by the turn of the decade. We believe we have the policies to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recently announced enhancements to the Working Nation package clearly demonstrate the flexibility of the program and the ability and willingness of the government to respond to the identified needs of clients. That is another aspect of misunderstanding which is very apparent in the way in which this subject has been addressed by our opponents, and again indicated by the member for Tangney. In the 2 1/2 years since the government was returned to office, we have achieved 655,000 new jobs, and a drop in the unemployment rate from 11.2 per cent to 8.7 per cent. We are committed to this target of five per cent and that is what we will be working towards. The competitive case management system established by the Employment Services Act is now fully in place. In March 1995, EAA let contracts for 102,000 job seekers over 1994-95 and 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994-95, around 30,000 job seekers entered case management with private or community sector case managers. The system will now be expanded so that contracted case managers can manage up to 130,000 clients in 1995-96. That is the importance which the government has placed on the competitive model which has been set up by Working Nation, which again is not properly appreciated or understood by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in this bill represent machinery changes to the operation of the case management system. In fact, something which I do not believe is properly understood by our opposition is that most of the measures are as a result of policy changes in the social security area. Rather than reflecting adversely on the operation of this case management system, this bill is evidence that the legislation governing the system is working well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Working Nation enhancements which were announced by the minister additional resources are to be provided to ESRA so that contracted case managers can take on the extra 28,000 job seekers. An extra 200 staff will be provided to the CES to enhance service delivery to job seekers. The member for Goldstein stated that contracted case managers consider that they are getting the hard cases. If he understood the legislation&mdash;indeed, if anyone in the opposition understood the legislation, they might enlighten the member for Goldstein; they clearly do not understand it, as evidenced by their contributions to this debate&mdash;he would realise that the primary factor determining which job seekers go to which case managers is the job seeker's choice. That is, they decide if they want to go to Employment Assistance Australia or to a contracted case manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Goldstein's assertions are also not supported by the data which show that Employment Assistance Australia case managers and contracted case managers have the same proportion of harder to place job seekers. The member for Goldstein also claimed that the government was counting people who received the notification letter we are removing through this bill as being in case management to `bump up the numbers'. This of course is incorrect. Job seekers are not counted as being in case management until they are referred to a case management organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Goldstein also commented on the size of the case loads of some case managers. Since case management was first introduced in 1994, the department has been closely monitoring case loads being carried out by case managers to ensure that expected levels of outcomes are being achieved and that workload levels of case managers are in fact reasonable. In the case of Employment Assistance Australia, EAA, rather than stipulate a case load maximum, it is our policy that case loads for individual case managers will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the skills and experience of the case manager, client characteristics, the state of the local labour market and the training and educational opportunities available. For example, a case manager with a high proportion of his or her clients in long-term English as a second language courses will be able to handle a larger case load than a case manager with job seekers actively looking for work. In fact, Employment Assistance Australia has been a very successful innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of contracted case managers, ESRA sought to limit case load sizes during the filling of case loads. Recently, ESRA has decided to lift case load limits in recognition of the changing composition of case loads. The average case load size was 97 at the end of September 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Goldstein also spoke about the ANAO efficiency audit of case management, which was again referred to by the member for Tangney. There are a number of things I want to make clear. Firstly, this was not an audit of the current case management arrangements announced in Working Nation. It was an audit of the old case management arrangements introduced under newstart in March 1994 during an early developmental and implementation phase. The Working Nation case management arrangements commenced in February 1995 following the passing of the Employment Services Act 1994. So I do not quite know what the currency is in having a debate developed by the opposition about an audit which has nothing to do with the present status of case management in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example of how the audit lacks relevance to the current case management system. The member for Goldstein quoted survey results from the ANAO report. What the member for Goldstein did not mention was that the survey does not appear to consider employment as a key objective of case management or to evaluate case management against outcomes achieved for job seekers, assumes that a job seeker's awareness of the CES process and associated administrative detail reflects the quality and success of the service provided and asked clients about introductory case management procedures and arrangements which no longer exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the ANAO audit states that the overall implementation of case management was well managed. The report identifies a number of significant achievements made under case management&mdash;something not acknowledged, of course, by our opponents. It recognises that a case management program was put into place in the time frame required and that clients were aware of their responsibilities and were satisfied with the type and frequency of the contact they had had with the CES. The ANAO noted a number of good strategies and practices that assisted in achieving case management outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the ANAO ignored DEET's advice to delay the audit until the Working Nation case management arrangements were established. Instead, it chose to audit a system, which was constantly evolving, three months into a 12-month process. So is it any wonder, if the opposition believe that the debate they are now pursuing has any legs, that it has not because, clearly, we have something which judged the system very early in its development and not nearly enough thought was given to what would happen over 12 months and what the status would be today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset, case management was enhanced progressively to improve its effectiveness and efficiency, to accommodate Working Nation changes, and to prepare for further substantial development under statutory case management, which was introduced in February of 1995. Unsurprisingly, because the auditors were aware of the developments taking place as the case management system was implemented, all of ANAO's recommendations reflect the department's operating policies and arrangements. Clearly, either that is not understood by the opposition or they have chosen to ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management provides a valuable and effective service to unemployed Australians. The case management system has been continually enhanced to address dynamic operational conditions and aims to provide the best possible service and outcomes for clients. Despite what the member for Goldstein would have you believe, the government will continue, through appropriate targeting of its labour market programs, to work towards reducing the unemployment rate to the five per cent target it has set for the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the opposition has no strategy for tackling unemployment, short of leaving it to the marketplace. We did hear a little gem from the member for Tangney about the community employment program, unexplained&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, unfinanced and certainly unexplained. We heard the shadow Treasurer (Mr Costello) on a previous occasion saying that one of the areas they would seek to target for cutbacks in expenditure would be Working Nation. Yet against the member for Goldstein, bleating about the supposed failures of the case management system we are incorporating, arguing that we are not getting effective employment outcomes, we have a record of 655,000 jobs since this government was last elected&mdash;not a bad result but something which is not acknowledged positively by our opponents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, without a coherent policy base, without any policy substance, we have the shadow spokesman for Treasury matters saying that this is an area that they would cut into. You cannot have it both ways. We want a coherent public policy which addresses the needs of the unemployed in a most substantial way&mdash;such as the way this government has committed in excess of $10.3 billion over four years, something which the opposition say they are going to target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say to us that they are concerned about young Australians. What is it? Are you concerned about young Australians? If so, you would support these proposals. If you were concerned about young Australians you would not allow the shadow Treasurer to come in here and say that you would cut into Working Nation, because that has been the most effective program that any government has put to the community to address the needs of young Australians seeking work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That needs to be properly understood. We have been unusually successful in this regard because we have had the cooperation of a very committed Commonwealth Employment Service and we have had the wit, wisdom and good public sense to develop a public policy initiative and fund it to the tune of in excess of $10.3 billion. Now, as a result of its implementation, we are tuning it up. Yet we have the opposition in here this afternoon bleating about the tuning up process, making direct aspersions about that process, concentrating on an ANAO report which was done three months into a 12-month development phase and which is clearly out of date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know where the opposition are coming from, or who is advising the shadow minister or his colleagues, but they clearly do not understand Working Nation. They have no policy proposals which they can put to the Australian community to compete with Working Nation. All we have from them are exasperated comments about the way this government is doing its job. We have nothing clear, nothing concrete. There are implicit and quite direct contradictions between comments of the shadow Treasury spokesman, talking about cuts in Working Nation expenditure, and comments by the shadow minister and his colleagues who spoke in this debate about how they would change things&mdash;changes which are as yet unfunded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would ask them: if you do have a policy, could you please tell us what it is? If you do not have a policy, at least be constructively critical about what the government is doing. Give us the support that we want in the community to ensure that all Australians looking for work get a chance to get a job. Stop this opportunistic bleating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt in my mind where we would be headed if we were unfortunate enough to have the opposition spokesperson as the minister for education. There would be no tolerance of the concerns of young Australians or those in need which have been expressed by this government through Working Nation. There would be none of the flexibility that the government has put into its arrangements for the delivery of its labour market services. There would be no regional initiatives of the type this government has put in place through Working Nation's area consultative committee structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done a great deal to address the needs of unemployed Australians. We have heard the opposition come in here and debate this bill&mdash;which, as I said, is really a machinery bill&mdash;and use it as a vehicle to try to demonstrate to the Australian community that we are not doing what we said we would do in Working Nation, which is clearly wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the opposition have given up on the issue of unemployment and they do not have any coherent policy framework. If they did have, they would tell us what it is. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said on a number of occasions, and as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has constantly said, `If you have a policy, let us have it.' If you have some coherent framework for addressing the needs of unemployed Australians, let us see it. If you had something you wanted to tell the electorate about&mdash;what you will do to help them get back to work, what you will do in the case of providing traineeships, training programs and vocational training and addressing the needs of young unemployed and those professional people who are out of work&mdash;you would tell us what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, you have not, because you do not have a policy framework. This government will not give up on Working Nation or its objectives.

<PARA>The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1995 will provide legislative authority for measures that will assist in giving effect to the government's decision to restructure the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. It will also provide for the abolition of related legislation, namely the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965 and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restructuring, or corporatisation, of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was announced in the 1995-96 budget. It is designed to provide the corporation with greater freedom to operate on a strict commercial basis and, as such, to put it on a more comparable footing vis-a-vis its competitors. The decision to follow this approach reflects the same considerations that had earlier influenced the government to attempt to sell the corporation, namely that the prevailing conditions in the mortgage insurance and finance industries now differ considerably compared with when the corporation was set up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established as a statutory authority 30 years ago to meet a structural deficiency in the highly regulated financial environment which existed at that time. Its primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance; financial institutions tended to allocate their then scarce housing funds on a least-risk basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since those days, a competitive private sector mortgage insurance industry has emerged in Australia. Together with the finance industry reforms introduced by this government, this has removed the old structural deficiency in the housing finance market. With these improvements in access to housing finance, the objective of the government has been to maintain and enhance these achievements by ensuring that there is an efficient, diverse and competitive mortgage insurance market. The decision a number of years ago to attempt to sell the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation reflected the view that the continued involvement of a statutory authority in the industry was not consistent with this objective. However, efforts to sell the corporation have not proceeded since it has become clear that the sale was not going to produce a satisfactory result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the government has considered alternative approaches. It commissioned the task force on asset sales financial advisers, Baring Brothers Burrows &amp; Co. Ltd, to undertake a complete review of the sale process and the corporation's position in the market. They concluded, among other things, that the corporation enjoyed a number of advantages over its private sector competitors arising from its statutory authority status, including the guarantee of its liabilities, and from the fact that it is not subject to the supervision of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these benefits, which put the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation on a different basis to its competitors, would not be available to any potential purchasers, it was difficult for them to establish the nature and size of the business that would exist post-sale and, so, to put a value on the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporatisation arrangements that the government now proposes represent a significant move in addressing these concerns. A new company will be established under the Corporations Law and will be subject to the regulatory requirements of the ISC, as well as those of the states and territories. The new company will be fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the ISC, drawing on part of the present capital and reserves of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing Commonwealth guarantee will be removed as far as borrowings by the corporation are concerned. However, the Commonwealth guarantee for non-borrowing liabilities has been retained, at least for the moment, to minimise any uncertainty in the mortgage insurance industry that might arise as a consequence of the restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, given its prominent position in the market. Furthermore, to enable the company to attain the minimum credit rating required for mortgage insurers by state legislation without retaining that guarantee, it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to commit significant additional capital resources to the corporation over and above what is already proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in setting a target rate of return for the company, account will be taken of any advantage the retention of the guarantee may accord it. With the removal of the guarantee on borrowing, there is no longer a need for a specific legislative provision as the Treasurer has the powers under the constitution to guarantee liabilities of a non-borrowing nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will cease writing business on the day before the new company comes into operation. The insurance policies of the corporation entered into prior to and including that date, which we might refer to as the `old book', will become the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth. In exchange for accepting these liabilities, the Commonwealth will receive the balance of the corporation's capital and reserves. On the budget estimates, the level of funds likely to be transferred to consolidated revenue is expected to be in excess of $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will be contracted by the Commonwealth to administer the unexpired portion of all insurance obligations contained in the old book. Funds will be set aside by the Commonwealth in a special account to be established by this new company and will be replenished as and when necessary to meet claims against these insurance contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of the old book to the Commonwealth along these lines is consistent with the arrangements that would have been put in place had the sale of the corporation proceeded in 1991. Separation of the old book will, in particular, enable the new company's performance to be judged independently of the corporation's previous operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill currently before the House is designed to assist in giving effect to the arrangements that I have just outlined. It includes the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">provision to the Treasurer of the necessary powers to direct the transfer of assets and liabilities in whatever way is considered appropriate to give effect to the abovementioned objectives;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">authority for the Treasurer to enter into an agreement with the new company which would cover the terms under which existing insurance contracts would be managed, as well as the means by which payments for claims arising from these contracts could be made. The latter includes a standing appropriation for the required funding;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">the transfer of staff of the corporation to the new company, as well as the transfer of all current rights enjoyed by those staff with respect to such matters as long service leave, superannuation, maternity leave and Comcare. It is not intended that the interests of the staff should in any way be adversely affected by this corporatisation exercise;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">provision to exempt from taxation transactions involving such matters as the transfer of assets that would not have arisen apart from the corporatisation exercise; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">finally, the winding up of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and the repeal of all relevant legislation relating to the corporation. As part of the winding up exercise, a final report and detailed financial statements as at the date of cessation of the corporation's activities will be prepared by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. After being audited by the audit office, they will be tabled in the parliament in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by pointing out to the House that the restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation that is proposed is seen by the government as an important step in its efforts to maintain an efficient and competitive mortgage insurance market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill will reap for the Commonwealth government up to $100 million in benefit from the restructure of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. In other words, the Commonwealth government is undertaking a practice which those of us from Victoria have well known in past years under the Cain-Kirner government&mdash;when statutory authorities were raided for the reserves they held in order to pass them to the government to meet the difficulties the government was having with its own budget. One of the fundamental outcomes of this piece of legislation is exactly the same in relation to the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established in 1965 to insure lenders against losses arising out of the making of loans for housing. The original bill authorised the corporation to put into effect the then government's promised housing loans insurance scheme and empowered the corporation to insure loans made for the erection of homes, the purchase of existing homes, additions to homes, the repair and improvement of homes, and the discharge and refinancing of existing mortgages on homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purposes of the scheme were to assist people to obtain, as a single loan and at a reasonable rate of interest, the money they needed and could afford to borrow to buy or build a home. As the amount borrowed may at times have been a high proportion of the value of a house and land, there was a risk that the lender may lose some of the capital and may not receive all the interest due to him or her. The offer by the corporation to insure against the risk of loss due to failure to recover the amount outstanding on the loan, together with accrued interest, enabled lenders to protect themselves against such losses. As the then Minister for Housing, Mr Bury, said when introducing the legislation to introduce this scheme:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme aims to assist people to borrow, by means of a single loan secured by a first mortgage, the difference between available personal savings and the cost of a home suited to their requirements. The amount of the loan would, of course, be related to the ability of the borrower to repay it over a reasonable period. It is our hope and intention that this scheme will progressively remove the present need for many creditworthy borrowers to obtain a second mortgage loan, frequently on oppressive terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that that scheme, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) pointed out, which has been in operation now for something like 30 years, has been quite successful. In fact, it was reported in the financial press earlier this year that the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is a clear leader in the mortgage insurance market, responsible for close to half of an estimated $130 million in premiums written each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular bill, which the government has introduced, will restructure the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation in the following form. First, the corporation will be reconstituted as a new government-owned company, established under the Corporations Law and subject to regulation by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. As is presently the case, the new company's non-borrowing liabilities will be government guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the new company will be fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Thirdly, the corporation's existing portfolio of insurance policies, the so-called `old book', will at the time of its restructure become the responsibility of the Commonwealth in exchange for which the Commonwealth will receive the corporation's capital and reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the new corporation will be contracted by the Commonwealth to manage the run-off of the old book. Claims arising from the old book will be met from the future budget outlays. The bill will also repeal the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965, which originally established the corporation, as well as the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990, which provided the authority for the Commonwealth to sell the corporation to a private organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated financial implications of the proposal include the following: first, there is an estimated negative outlay to the budget of approximately $100 million in 1995-96, reflecting a return to the Commonwealth of the corporation's capital and financial reserves after allowance for the capitalisation costs of the new corporation. This is quite clear here. To place it in ordinary everyday lay language, the Treasuryspeak of an estimated negative outlay to the budget means that the Commonwealth is raiding the reserves of the corporation for its own purposes; namely, that amount of money flowing to the Commonwealth. Secondly, the expected outlays in future years are: $20 million in 1996-97, $15 million in 1997-98 and $8 million in 1998-99. These outlays are largely related to costs associated with the management of the old book on behalf of the Commonwealth. I will come back to that point in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main advantage to the Commonwealth from the restructuring of the corporation is that it gets to raid the corporation's capital and unearned premium reserve. The government so far has not been able to provide any estimate of the amount to which it will capitalise the new company. The primary reason why the government failed in its attempt to privatise the existing corporation is that it was not adequately capitalised and therefore could not survive without the support of the government guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By restructuring and recapitalising the company, it is probably the government's intention to privatise the new company some years down the track. I note there has been speculation in the financial media in recent times that what the government intends to do is attempt to privatise the company some time in the future having failed to do that a number of years ago. If one looks at this from an overall perspective, one can see in relation to some of the activities of the corporation the state of housing in Australia at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in his second reading speech that the prevailing conditions in the mortgage, insurance and finance industries now differ considerably compared with when the corporation was set up. He noted that the primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance. Financial institutions tended to allocate their then scarce housing funds on a least risk basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Assistant Treasurer says that since those days a competitive private sector mortgage insurance industry has emerged in Australia. When one looks into the actual situation of housing in this country, one sees that, even on the basis of this legislation and the explanatory memorandum that has been provided by the government with it, home loan defaults are set to rocket over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact it was disclosed a couple of months ago that the number of people falling behind in their payments had leapt 37 per cent over a few months, while home repossessions had jumped 20 per cent since January 1995. What we are facing here is a restructuring of the corporation with a view to selling it down the track without any provision that appears, on the face of the documentation, to say there will be adequate capitalisation of the corporation, but at a time when Australians are finding it increasingly difficult to provide for a house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look back at the debates that occurred under the bill that was introduced in 1965, when this corporation was first legislated. The then member for Werriwa, Mr Gough Whitlam, made reference in 1965 to the affordability of housing. In his speech he said that, if a person wished to buy a house for #5,000, which he indicated was the average price for a house and land at that stage, what would be required was a weekly income of #31. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the changes which have occurred not only since 1965 but also from 1975 to 1995, one can see a marked deterioration in the ability of ordinary Australians to afford a house. Let us look, for example, at the median price of a first home in 1975 according to the Housing and Urban Development Council. I should say that the Housing and Urban Development Council has put out a very glossy publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leading the new housing environment</EMPHASIS>. The publication is endorsed by none other than the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), and former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, whose glossy photograph appears in the publication. It is also endorsed by the federal member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and chair of the caucus community services committee, whose even larger glossy photograph appears in this glossy publication. I am not sure whether it is as large as the glossy photos that appear in the publications of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), but the member certainly wants to make the world aware that he exists and that he is working on behalf of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us take the figures in the publication which appear under the title `The affordability challenge'. In 1975, this document says, the median price of a first home in Australia was $25,500. Then it goes through a calculation to ascertain the affordability for Australians to actually purchase a home. They took off a 10 per cent deposit, worked on a variable rate of interest of nine per cent over a 25-year loan and came up with a monthly loan repayment of $192.60. They added property taxes and came to a total monthly repayment of $207.40, and that required an annual income of $9,955. So in 1975, according to the Housing and Urban Development Council&mdash;of which a member of this government is a member&mdash;to purchase the median priced home of $25,500, an annual income of $9,955 would have been required in order to meet repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in the 20 years since 1975? According to the council, in 1995 the median price for a first home is $137,900&mdash;an increase from $25,500 to $137,900. When you again take off a 10 per cent deposit and apply a 25-year variable interest rate of 10.5 per cent, you have a monthly loan repayment requirement of $1,171.82. Add on property taxes and the total monthly repayment is $1,253.82. Remember that in 1975 the required annual income for a median priced first home in Australia was $9,955. So what is it in 1995? According to the council, the required annual income is $60,184. Over the space of 20 years, we have had more than a sixfold increase in the annual income required in order to afford a median priced first home in Australia. That is an increase from $9,555 to $60,184 in terms of annual income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the minister speaks about changes in terms of affordability, in effect, as he did in his second reading speech, he talks about removing the old structural deficiency. But when we then look at affordability of housing in this country we can see that, if affordability is put in terms that can be carried from one era to another, it probably takes something like five years of wages at average earnings to afford a house in Australia now compared with about three years of average earnings back in 1975, or thereabouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we now have coming through quite clearly is that there is a slowdown in housing which the Housing Industry Association expects to continue over the rest of the decade. The association predicts, for example, that spending on new dwellings will fall from an annual average of $13.6 billion dollars in 1990-95 to $11.1 billion in 1995-2000&mdash;and that is in constant dollar prices. We have comments being made by people such as social researcher Jeanne Strachan, who said just recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young couples today are the first generation since the war to face the reality that they often can't obtain, even with two full-time workers in the house, what their own parents saw as fair and reasonable reward for their hard work.</PARA>
<PARA>She is saying that, from hundreds and thousands of focus groups which she has conducted around the country, young people are saying today, `To be able to achieve what our parents regarded as fair and reasonable&mdash;that is, to be able to afford a house in Australia today&mdash;is something which even with two incomes is becoming almost impossible to afford.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at what is happening with the gap between the rich and the poor in Australia, then that is borne out. As the business commentator, Phil Ruthven, pointed out in some calculations recently, the proportion of households with income of more than $72,000 had risen from 15 per cent in 1976 to 30 per cent in 1992. That is, the proportion of households with an income in constant dollars of more than $72,000 a year had doubled from 15 per cent in 1976 to 30 per cent in 1992. At the other end, the proportion of households with an income below $22,000 had also increased, from 20 per cent in 1976 to 30 per cent in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the group who are the most highly paid, those households with the highest income, having doubled in size over a period of approximately 20 years. But also at the other end of the scale, the households with the lowest income, below $22,000 a year, have also increased substantially in number. The group in the middle&mdash;and we had the old egalitarian notion that Australia had this large middle class&mdash;has been rapidly shrinking under this government. Whereas previously there were 65 per cent in the middle, with incomes between $22,000 and $72,000&mdash;and that is a broad sweep of incomes&mdash;that now has been reduced to about 40 per cent of households in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is borne out also by statistics in relation to the geographic location of households. Research that was done by Professor Bob Gregory, himself a member of the Reserve Bank board, and Mr Boyd Hunter, from the ANU's Centre for Economic Policy Research, said in 1995 that there was a significant increase in the geographic polarisation of household income across Australia. In the top five per cent of areas ranked according to their socioeconomic status, household income increased by $12,555&mdash;that is, up 23 per cent&mdash;between 1976 and 1991, measured in 1995 prices. Yet in the lowest five per cent of areas, household income fell by $7,589&mdash;that is 23 per cent also&mdash;over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if we take geographic locations and the households in those geographic locations which have the highest income, it will be seen that over a period of almost 20 years their income has increased by 23 per cent. Then if we take the households in the geographic locations that have the lowest income&mdash;the five per cent lowest income&mdash;over that same period of time their income has increased also by 23 per cent. So, looking at this set of figures or the housing council's set of figures, we see that the gap between the rich and the poor in this country is continuing to increase as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1976 the weekly income gap between the average household income from the bottom one per cent of census collector districts, which are small areas of 200 to 300 dwellings&mdash;we are talking about areas which can be defined as neighbourhoods; they are small areas within suburbs or are very small country towns or villages with 200 or 300 dwellings&mdash;and the average household income in the medium census collector districts was not very large. In 1976 an additional part-time job for nine hours a week at $12 an hour would have closed the gap between those in the bottom one per cent and those at the median point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To close the gap by 1991 did not require nine hours extra work a week at $12 an hour; it required an additional 19 hours per week. In 1995 prices that means the gap from 1976 to 1991 had increased from $116 a week to $230 a week. All this relates to the housing affordability of Australians. Similarly, the gap between the average household income in the medium census collector districts and the top one per cent of collector districts increased markedly. In 1976 an additional weekly income of $442 was required to close the gap, but by 1991 the amount required had risen to $885. In other words, in 1991 an amount of $44,489 a year would be required to take you from the middle to the top, yet about half that amount was all that was required in constant prices back in 1976. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> contains a report about the status of middle income families in Australia. The first paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintaining middle class status in Australia is getting harder and now requires two incomes, a new study has found. It found more families are relying on a second part-time job to maintain their standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to report the findings of the study by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra. Whether you take these figures or the figures that show the widening gap between those who are rich and those who are poor, whether you take the figures which relate to geographic locations in Australia&mdash;they show again that there is a widening gap between those who live in high income areas and those who live in low income areas&mdash;or whether you take the housing affordability figures, which are provided by the Housing and Urban Development Council in this glossy publication, one message comes through time after time: the gap between the rich and the poor in this country is increasing day after day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony of the situation is that we have had a government for almost 13 years which when it won office said, `We're going to come here with a social contract which is going to help the poor in this country. We come forward and hold up our hand as being the great defenders of the egalitarian society.' Yet today Australia is less egalitarian as a consequence of this government's policies than it was when it first came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see that the government is using this legislation as an opportunity to raid the resources, to raid the reserves, of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation to provide the government's coffers with an extra $100 million. It had an opportunity about five years ago to restructure and privatise this corporation and it failed to do so. It is doing this restructure so that it can overcome some of its own budgetary difficulties at the present time with an idea that somewhere down the line it may well be able to privatise the corporation again. But, having failed to show how it is going to be adequately capitalised in the meantime, the prospects of being able to privatise it at that stage would appear to be remote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not oppose this legislation, but we take this opportunity to point out that the circumstances for ordinary Australians in terms of housing are not improving.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1995, as outlined by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech, is designed to facilitate the restructure of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. To this end, the provisions of the bill will see the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation take the form I will outline. The housing loans insurance company will be reconstituted as a new government owned company established under the Corporations Law and subject to regulation by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. As is presently the case, the new company's non-borrowing liabilities will be government guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new company will be fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The corporation's existing portfolio of insurance policies will, at the time of its restructure, become the responsibility of the Commonwealth, in exchange for which the Commonwealth will receive the corporation's capital and reserves. The new company which replaces the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will be contracted to manage the `run-off' of the existing portfolio of insurance policies, and claims arising from the existing portfolio will be met from future budget outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated financial implications of this proposal are outlined in the 1995-96 budget, which indicates that an initial negative outlay to the 1995-96 budget of approximately $100 million will occur, reflecting the return to the Commonwealth of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation's capital and financial reserves. Similarly, outlays associated with the costs of managing the old portfolio on behalf of the Commonwealth will be approximately $20 million in 1996-97, $15 million in 1997-98 and $8 million in 1998-99. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to restructure or corporatise the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation as outlined in the 1995-96 budget is based on the fact that the conditions that prevail in the mortgage insurance and finance industries are dramatically different from when the corporation was initially set up. As members will be aware, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established as a statutory authority under the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965 and has been operating for approximately 30 years. The corporation ensures lenders against losses on loans secured by mortgages, principally in terms of housing loans. However, in more recent years it has grown to encompass secured loans for the purchase, construction or refinancing of non-residential buildings as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, or, for that matter, any mortgage insurance corporation, is quite often misunderstood, I believe, by honourable members. I can recall that at one stage the HLIC was the only player in the field. Of course, since then other private players have come into the market. I think one of the first ones was Morgan Guaranty, which came in some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember from my involvement with the banking industry the reasons why banks took out particularly mortgage insurance. It was really aimed at covering the gap where they lent substantial amounts of money against a property and they did not have enough margin from their own security in the loan to give them absolute protection. Of course, lenders always wanted to make sure they were well protected. I suggest lenders do not sustain much loss in terms of the housing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to make the point that mortgage insurers were protecting only lenders and certainly not the purchasers of properties. If someone defaulted on their loan and it was necessary for a lender to take advantage of their insurance, it would cover only the gap between what the bank or lender would get from the sale of the property and the amount of the loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, if they sold a property for $100,000 and the loan was for $110,000, they would only have to call on the insurance company for the difference of $10,000. So it is often suggested that it was actually protecting the purchasers or the owners of the homes. It certainly was not. It was protecting the lender, and it still does today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to some of the changes over the years in the HLIC. In 1985 amendments to the act empowered the corporation to insure approved dealers in the secondary mortgage market against losses on mortgage loans directly or indirectly relating to instruments to be traded in the market. Complementing the 1985 amendments, the government in 1987 altered the act to empower the corporation to enter into reinsurance contracts with lenders or subsidiary companies of lenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is the largest mortgage insurer in Australia and operates in a highly competitive mortgage insurance marketplace. Indeed, the last annual report of the corporation, as at 30 June 1994, reveals that total assets of the corporation stood at $217.7 million, the total number of loans insured stood at a record 94,694 and underwriting profits had reached $17.1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, there can be little doubt that the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation has achieved its primary charter of helping low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance by providing security for mortgage lenders against the possibility of default, as I highlighted a moment ago. That was the purpose of it: to make it more attractive for all lenders to actually lend at no risk to themselves. The risk was the insurance premium, and the premium was paid by the home owner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the structural deficiencies in the highly regulated financial environment of the 1960s have long since evaporated and it is now time that we place the corporation on a more comparable footing with its competitors and ensure that it has more freedom to act through operations on a strict commercial basis. This in turn will lead to greater efficiency and diversity in the mortgage insurance industry and subsequently the housing industry in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is important now that the HLIC will be able to compete effectively with the other players in the market. This is often the case where the government has set up organisations like the HLIC in the marketplace in which there is no private sector involvement. Now the private sector is picking up the initiative because they can probably see that it is not such a bad business after all. They can come in there and see what has actually happened. So the HLIC can now be very much an effective competitor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vibrant and competitive mortgage insurance market goes hand in hand with a sustainable home loan market, which in turn leads to the issue of affordability and mortgage repayment rates. At the moment, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), is attempting to portray himself as the home owner's friend in a cynical exercise to solicit votes by peddling a host of grossly misleading claims about mortgage repayment rates in this country. It is important to note some of his comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for the opposition leader, his rhetoric is not supported by his own record in the area of home loans, and the people of Australia can see through his statistical manipulations. It is important to note that many young Australians out there now purchasing homes would not have been old enough or interested enough in those days to consider purchasing homes. I can recall just how difficult it was for young people purchasing homes prior to 1983. I was actually working in the market myself, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, would well know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget, though, that when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer&mdash;these are the points we need to highlight&mdash;he gave Australia double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. We should keep reminding this place of that. There is no way in the world Australia wants to go back to those bad old days, nor should we ever contemplate it. At the same time, he was overseeing a home loan system with relatively high interest rates which discriminated against low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though organisations like the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation were covering that little gap in the market for lenders, there were other criteria for lending which certainly discriminated against people with lower incomes. The affordability of housing for them and the deposits required for purchasing homes were issues that were certainly very difficult for many people to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally a bank's requirement was that somebody had to have a deposit of at least 25 per cent to take out a mortgage. It was very difficult for people on lower incomes to achieve that sort of deposit. Today things have changed, and it has all been done under a Labor government. Today the variable home loan rate is 10.5 per cent. When the coalition left office in 1983 the rates were just touching the 14 per cent mark. That was in the banking industry; it did not include the building societies and finance companies, where rates of between 16 and 20 per cent were common practice. I will come to the cocktail loans set-up shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that if you were to walk into a branch of, say, the Commonwealth Bank this afternoon you would have little trouble obtaining a fixed owner-occupied housing loan of 7 1/2 to eight per cent. Under a coalition government&mdash;under Howard&mdash;those fixed rates were not available. There were variable rates, which were much higher, and the deposits that owners required were much more substantial as well. The nominal rate that we have today is 10.5 per cent. The opposition leader likes to base his comparisons on that. He really needs to look at a lot of those fixed lending proposals that are available to people today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the home loan market today is an extremely competitive one, to say the least. It is a great credit to this Labor government since 1983 that it was prepared to meet the challenges that were there and which improved the housing opportunities for all Australians. It actually took a Labor government to reform that market, after years of neglect from the coalition government. The coalition should actually be apologising for what they did to Australians in relation to housing back in the 1970s. Today housing finance is much more widely available than when members of the opposition last sat on the treasury bench. The member for Menzies was speaking before about the comparisons between 1975 and 1995. He does a fair bit with figures, and manipulated those figures. I would challenge his figures, but I will leave that to a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the style of housing today, there are smaller houses being built but, generally speaking, houses built today are of a better quality and larger than the homes constructed in 1975. A lot of them were basic homes back then. We have to take all those aspects into account. There were a lot of young people around too. When a young couple first got married they could not always afford a home first up. Saving a deposit for those homes would take some time. The first thing a lot of young people do these days is go out and take the opportunity to purchase a home first up based on their two incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have stopped discrimination against women anyway. In the past, when a lot of women got married, they actually lost their jobs, particularly in the public sector and the large banking institutions where I worked. I can remember quite clearly in 1975 the case of a young couple who were working with me in a particular branch of the bank. They decided to get married. The male could keep working, but the woman had to resign from her job. That was the norm in those days; it does not happen now. That is a great change in our society. I know that many members of the opposition support that move in our society as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people today have greater opportunities to purchase their homes. As soon as they get married or as soon as they decide to develop a relationship, they can actually purchase a home and make higher repayments early in the piece, which will eventually help them to own their own home a lot quicker than was the case in the past. That sort of restructuring through the housing industry has actually happened. Once again, it has happened under this government since 1983. It was not available to people prior to that. There are many initiatives that have helped people purchase their own homes. Some of the young people I see purchase pretty good quality brick homes now whereas years ago a first home would have often been a little three-bedroom timber home. They are getting opportunities to purchase their own homes and all the associated things that go with them. The quality is there for them. There are still other areas in the market where people are not in that position, but they get helped a lot from this government, through our social justice initiatives and reforms in assisting people on those lower incomes, which they certainly would not get under those people opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, it took a Labor government to implement these reforms in the market after years of neglect by the coalition government. There are many opportunities today. Deregulation and greater competition have meant that people are able to buy houses sooner and with smaller deposits. You can now get housing loans through banks with only a 10 per cent deposit, whereas years ago you had to have a deposit of 25 per cent. In those days people on lower incomes used to have to go to finance companies or building societies to borrow. Nowadays building society interest rates are comparable and they can compete effectively with the banks. They were not able to be competitive in those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a small deposit means a bigger mortgage and relatively high mortgage costs. That is a far cry from John Howard's rationed and regulated home regime of the early 1980s when we saw those cocktail loans which I referred to earlier. I can remember quite clearly that people had to have a first and a second mortgage. They would borrow some money from a bank and then they would have to head off to a building society or a finance company. Quite often, the banks would write that additional loan themselves through the finance company, which meant people had to pay exorbitant rates. In many cases they were personal loans, but the rates were much higher than they would have been for a housing loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the opposition leader may have a selective memory when it comes to the cocktail loans of the late 1970s and early 1980s, at least his deputy, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), has recognised the folly of coalition policy settings. At a CEDA conference on 27 July 1994 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the system of credit controls that prevailed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this was under Howard as the Treasurer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">banks refused to lend to borrowers who did not have a record of saving with them, and refused to lend to borrowers who could not offer generous security against their loans. This made it harder for the lower income groups to compete for housing finance against the middle income groups, and forced them to seek out housing finance through alternative and more costly forms of finance.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Higgins was quite clearly contradicting the previous coalition government's attitudes. Perhaps Mr Howard should take some advice from Mr Costello on some of these things, although I am not sure that would be a good idea. We will leave that to them to sort out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite unbelievable, in the light of his previous record, that the opposition leader would have the gall to actually stand in front of the Australian people with rubbery mortgage repayment figures and expect them to believe him. We need to remind the Australian people not to be hoodwinked by the Leader of the Opposition in this way, because his record speaks for itself. It is a disgraceful record and it is something that he should hang his head in shame for. He should apologise to the nation, along with his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His pathetic attempts to mislead the Australian people are quickly put into perspective when you logically assess the situation and realise that for the most part loan repayments have risen only in relative terms between 1983 and 1995. You have to consider the fact that average weekly earnings have changed over that period. You have to put all this in context. Every opportunity they have, the opposition quote out of context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You need to take into consideration the increase in average weekly earnings and the fact that there is now a greater opportunity for young people particularly to have two incomes and to make big cash payments in the early part of housing loans. There is much more flexibility in housing loans. Years ago banks told people what their repayments would be and there was no flexibility whatsoever. There is now much more flexibility in the housing market and much more opportunity for young people to get into their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the prices are much more competitive. The price of borrowing is also more competitive. Earlier I referred to the member for Higgins who said that people had to have a track record with the banks. They had to be longstanding customers who had saved all their money with the bank over a given period. There were all sorts of requirements for people to qualify, before they got through the door in the first place to see the bank manager to see whether the bank would even consider lending them any money. Those bad old days have gone. There has been a real revolution in the housing market. I could continue for some time in that vein but perhaps I had better not as my time is just about at an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation gives us the opportunity to debate the requirements of mortgage insurance in the housing loan sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one outstanding fact about mortgage insurance&mdash;which is what we are talking about in this debate on the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1995&mdash;and that is that, as far as the ordinary home owner is concerned, the ordinary person who has to get a mortgage, it is a rip-off and a rort. They do not understand, when they are having to pay out so many hundreds of dollars, that it is not insurance for them; it is insurance for the lender&mdash;for the banks and insurance companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an absolute disgrace because you have a situation where somebody borrows money to buy a house and they think that, because they pay the insurance premium, they are being protected. Not on your nelly! No way! If you fall behind&mdash;if you lose your job and fall on hard times and cannot pay&mdash;the lenders take the house from you and flog it for whatever they can get for it. Mortgage insurance is not there to protect your mortgage; it is there to protect the difference between what is owed on the house and what the insurance company gets when it flogs it off at sale. The insurance companies do not care about the borrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you were a battler, an ordinary Australian family member, and you fell on hard times, if you had paid $900 or $1,200 in mortgage insurance you would think you would get something out of it&mdash;that you would get some protection. The reality is that when that happens there is no concern for ordinary families. They are left in the lurch. They end up without a house, with nothing. I am very angry about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to my friend the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott)&mdash;who is living in the past, talking about former coalition policies&mdash;not to forget the Whitlam years. I had a mortgage then and I had mortgage insurance. Thank God, I did not have to lose my house but I know how my interest rates went up and how the payments went up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if we want to talk about the past we can talk about Whitlam as well, but we need to be concerned with the present day and with the future. We could go on living in the past forever if you liked but we need to learn from it, not live in it. These days, with an election looming, all that my friends on the other side can do is bring up anecdotes about what happened in the past. People are far more concerned about what is happening now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to repeat that mortgage insurance, as far as the ordinary battling home owner is concerned, is a rip-off and a rort. Mortgage insurance covers lenders against the loss of principal, interest and other costs resulting from default by borrowers where the subsequent sale of a property fails to cover the outstanding debt. The Commonwealth owned Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is the main provider of mortgage insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While HLIC insurance cover protects the lender and involves a contract between the lender and HLIC, it is standard practice for lenders to charge the borrowers the full cost of mortgage insurance. They charge $900 as a one time premium for a $100,000 first mortgage loan with a loan to valuation ratio of 85 per cent. On a 90 per cent loan to valuation ratio the premium would be $1,200. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from personal experience that when you are buying a home you are strapped&mdash;you do not have lots of spare cash floating around but you desperately want to get your own home&mdash;but at the very last minute you find you have to provide another $900 or $1,200 to provide insurance for the lender. If the lender is so uncertain of your ability to repay, they should not be lending to you, or, if they want to protect themselves, they should take out the insurance and they should pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 there were 325 claims under this scheme, totalling $6.7 million&mdash;an average of $20,500. But the number of loans enforced in 1993-94 was 94,694. Over 94,500 loans were enforced and they claimed on 325. The claims totalled $6.7 million, but the premiums written amounted to $57.7 million. An enormous amount of money is going into the premiums, but very few claims are being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very definitely that we have to try to restructure the whole concept of mortgage insurance. I know the government wants to sell off the HLIC. It is making its third attempt now. It tried once in 1990, again in 1993 and it is having another go at it. I point out, too, that the government is going to milk $100 million from the existing HLIC. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the most important point about this. My concern is for the ordinary Australians, the families who live in my electorate&mdash;at Nambucca Heads, Toormina, Bayldon, South West Rocks or up the Macleay Valley. They want to be part of the Australian dream. They want to own their own homes, and, quite frankly, I believe they have a right to own their own homes. But they need to be able to get a loan without having to find another $900 or $1,200 for insurance premiums, which is rightly the responsibility of the lender. It is totally inappropriate that ordinary people should be put into the situation of having to find that extra money. As I said, in 1993-94 there were only 325 claims, and the income was significantly higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you look at the report of the HLIC, you see that all but a handful of the loans insured were for home ownership. It has now insured more than one million mortgages since it has been going. I believe that most of those premiums should have been paid by the insurers. In 1993-94 it had earned premiums of $34.8 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting, too, the number of executive employees earning significant incomes. In 1993 one executive earned between $100,000 and $110,000 and another earned between $120,000 and $130,000. In 1994, the number had grown to five. The HLIC has a total executive pay package of $539,000. The year before it was $222,000. It is outstanding that a Commonwealth corporation that is there purely to administer mortgage insurance needs to increase its number of highly paid executives by 2 1/2 times in one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very interesting that it has one executive earning in excess of a quarter of a million&mdash;$260,000&mdash;when ordinary battlers are having to fork out the $900 or $1,200, which they are having great difficulty in finding, to insure the mortgage. It is totally inappropriate. It is also very interesting that the full-time member of the corporation&mdash;who is not an employee as such, I believe&mdash;earns $128,000. So there is an enormous outlay of taxpayers' money for the salaries of the people administering this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the workers, the battlers, are being hit for $900 or $1,200 to pay mortgage insurance, which I believe should be paid by the lending authorities. They are the ones getting the protection. There is absolutely nothing in it for the home owners. If they default on their payments, if they cannot pay the interest or if they cannot pay the capital, they lose their homes&mdash;they lose the lot&mdash;and the only ones to benefit are the lending authorities; and they should be paying the premiums. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the letters written by the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, to the AMP Society of 18 September and 21 September, clearly intervening on behalf of certain directors of Coles Myer, in his capacity as `trustee on some superannuation funds'. Do you condone Mr Kelty's actions? Does the government support intervention against fund managers in this way?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The actions of Mr Kelty are for him to defend, and Mr Kelty has certainly strongly defended the actions that he has taken in respect of this matter. The government accepts that trustees of superannuation funds have considerable responsibilities. Through the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, it regards those trustees as being absolutely central to the superannuation industry&mdash;as having a great responsibility to ensure that the funds of the members of those funds are properly invested and that those funds bring about a beneficial retirement income for the members of the fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government sees the role of the trustees as being important. That does not mean to say that the trustees, in carrying out their role, cannot enter into public debate about issues. Clearly, that is what Mr Kelty, who is a trustee, I understand, felt compelled to do in this particular case. That does not stop him, because he is a trustee, having a right to have a say on issues. What would be wrong would be if there were some attempt to utilise funds in a particular way to bring about actions which had nothing to do with improving the benefits of the members. That would be a breach of trust and a breach of the trustees' responsibilities. I do not see any such action involved in Mr Kelty's actions in the matter referred to by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>

Some months ago, in July, the Leader of the Opposition said that he would, in government, provide the states with a fixed percentage share of Commonwealth taxation revenue and that this would be the way in which the general purpose payments to the states were made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without interruption, it will be a lot less than that. One proposal from the opposition is that we have this fixed share of Commonwealth tax revenue paid to the states, even though it would cost a hell of a lot more money, while they say they are about cutting government expenditure and improving the budget balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently we had another article, referred to yesterday in question time, as the member for Flinders mentioned, from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> published last Friday. In this, the shadow Treasurer is quoted as wanting to address the issue of vertical fiscal imbalance, which is, of course, the issue that the Commonwealth government raises much more than it actually spends and the states raise in taxation rather less than they actually spend and the Commonwealth makes up the difference to the states by making payments to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue with vertical fiscal imbalance is supposed to be that there is a problem involved in that, such that the states do not act responsibly in their expenditure if they do not raise the revenue they expend so, therefore, we should have a system of fiscal balance as between the federal and state governments, both of them spending effectively what they raise in tax revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in this article that this issue of vertical fiscal imbalance was `an important issue that has to be addressed'. He is also quoted as saying that it is `something we will be dealing with in our first term (of government)'. He goes on to say that the coalition will work to end vertical fiscal imbalance. He is described as saying that he has had discussions with all the state conservative governments and oppositions on the issues and they all support the idea of ending vertical fiscal imbalance. The article also quotes him as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difference between us and the Government is that we are willing to discuss these proposals. The Government is not.</PARA>
<PARA>We see that there is a whole series of direct statements of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, or statements attributed to him, about the need to address this issue and the importance of doing so. What the article then goes on to say, having talked about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that he is willing to discuss these proposals with the state leaders and opposition leaders from their own party, is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One proposal being discussed would have 15 percentage points of marginal income tax rates paid directly to the states, rather than the Commonwealth. Once the states had this power, they could raise or lower the rates, allowing them to abolish some of the . . . taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>If this were to happen&mdash;this is clearly something that is being discussed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition with his state counterparts&mdash;then clearly that would have some very substantial ramifications indeed. It would mean that the states would have responsibility for 16 per cent of income tax. The Commonwealth would remove itself from that and the states could then vary that amount depending on how they wanted to raise the money. But what it would mean is that, at 16 per cent, you would have vastly different outcomes per state from what you get now because of the allocations that are made through the grants commission redistributing the amounts to the states on the basis of need, and through the specific purpose payments. All of those things would go. It would all be raised by the states. There would be no payment from the Commonwealth to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would mean that, with this same amount of money involved, the allocation to the states would have been that New South Wales and Victoria would be better off by over $1 billion each&mdash;so they would be okay&mdash;but Queensland and South Australia would lose over $700 million each, Western Australia would lose $220 million, Tasmania would lose $360 million and the Northern Territory would lose $830 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states would be in the position where they would have these totally different outcomes than they now have through the current system. If they were to try to make up the difference, then New South Wales and Victoria could cut their rates by 2.6 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively. So, in the case of New South Wales, instead of a 16 per cent rate they could lower that to 13.4 per cent and the ACT could cut its rate by four per cent, but all the other states and territories would have to increase their taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland would have to raise their taxation rate by 2.9 per cent to 18.9 per cent. So everyone in Queensland would be paying an additional 2.9 per cent of their income in tax. In Western Australia it would go up to 17.4 per cent. They would all be paying an additional 1.4 per cent in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia the taxation rate would go up to 22 per cent. They would all be paying an additional six per cent. In Tasmania it would have to go up to 25.9 per cent. They would all be paying an additional 10 per cent. In the Northern Territory the position becomes quite ridiculous. They would have to be paying an additional 58.3 per cent, taking the total rate up to 74.3 per cent. That is before the rest of the federal income tax applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The top tax rate in the Northern Territory would then be over 100 per cent, 106.8 per cent&mdash;a ridiculous and absurd outcome, but that is the logic of what is being proposed in this article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS>, stemming from the discussions the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has had directly with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> and with his state party counterparts. You have, therefore, a totally unacceptable outcome in terms of the impact that would have on the states&mdash;quite clearly, much higher taxes in most parts of the country and absurdly higher taxes in the Northern Territory and even in Tasmania. So what we have is a ludicrous proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is not going to be a matter of changing tax rates&mdash;and since this article came out the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said that he is not going to change any tax rates&mdash;he still has all those quotes in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">BRW</EMPHASIS> about vertical fiscal imbalance. So did he make them or didn't he? If he did make those statements&mdash;and he is not denying that he did&mdash;and he is not going to address this through the tax side, he would have to address it through the expenditure side. In other words, he would have to take over, holus bolus, large segments of what is now state government activity and tack it on to the federal budget so that there would not be a vertical fiscal imbalance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can have it only one of two ways. You can do it either on the tax side, which you now say you rule out, or you can do it on the expenditure side, which means the federal government takes over reams of what is currently state government activity. It would mean that something around 36 per cent of state government expenditures would have to come on to the federal government books. That would have varying outcomes state by state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have from the opposition is, again, a totally ill-thought-out set of ideas, half-baked proposals. The opposition throws around the fixed share, not realising it will cost $2.8 billion, which makes a mockery of its proposal to cut back the budget outcome or increase the surplus, whatever. Again, the opposition is just wandering through the issue of vertical fiscal imbalance, absolutely without any thought, and putting forward a proposal that would have either on the income tax side or on the expenditure side a ridiculous and absurd outcome.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was clearly pressure from the institutions to force Pacific Dunlop to take action in respect of its food group because it was not making profits quickly enough. The sell-off of that was something which was forced upon Pacific Dunlop, it would seem, by the actions of institutions which were driven by some fairly short-term thinking in our opinion and I think in the opinion of various commentators at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That drew attention to this issue. Last year there was large scale selling off of Australian government bonds by the local institutions at a time when purchasing was being undertaken by overseas institutions. Here there were substantial sell-offs at considerable losses because they sold when interest rates were at their highest. Subsequently, interests rates fell and bond prices rose. They therefore sold at the worst time in the market. That was reflected in some very bad outcomes in terms of poor performance by the funds for 1994, particularly in the last quarter of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen therefore is some undesirable outcomes, and that probably left some of the people involved in making those decisions&mdash;particularly on the bonds&mdash;feeling like donkeys for having made them. What we need to do, however&mdash;and this is what we are concerned about&mdash;is to ensure that what we have from this industry is longer term thinking. That is what we want to see. We want to see the funds being prepared to make long-term investments&mdash;not just being driven by quarterly outcomes but being prepared to put some of their funds into areas which are slightly more risky.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all encompassed by the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which says in respect of managing assets that there is scope for funds which are concerned about long-term investments to make some investments in higher risk areas. For instance, page 22 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trustee Guidebook to Superannuation</EMPHASIS>, which is put out by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In managing the assets of the fund, trustees should bear in mind that superannuation is by nature a long-term investment. Investing for the longer term generally requires a balanced portfolio with some investment in equities and having a component of higher risk, higher return assets. For example, investment in venture capital projects can be quite acceptable in this context.</PARA>
<PARA>We would like to see more attention to that aspect of investment, to investment in areas like infrastructure, which probably has been underweight to this stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just remind members of the House about the critical principles here. Firstly, eligible persons must be given a choice to receive public hospital services free of charge&mdash;I underline that&mdash;as public patients. Secondly, the principles should guarantee access on the basis of clinical need. Thirdly, the provision of public hospital services should be done equitably throughout each of those states. You would think they are very inoffensive principles. They are certainly central to Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently&mdash;I am sure the member for Perth would be interested in this&mdash;I received correspondence from the Western Australian Minister for Health, Graham Kierath, who, as we know by now, is also the industrial relations minister and is notorious for imposing Howard-style industrial laws on the families of Western Australia. In fact, he has been so busy in  his role as John Howard's laboratory assistant conducting these industrial relations experiments that he has entirely dropped the ball on Medicare. Of course, his having dropped the ball on Medicare would not matter much to Mr Court or indeed to members opposite, because Medicare is fundamentally about families and they have no qualms about hurting families, especially if there is an ideological point to prove. They have been doing it with their IR legislation and their health policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Medicare agreements of 1993, all state governments guaranteed to pass legislation enshrining those principles that I outlined. Some 2 1/2 years later, what do I get from Mr Kierath? I get a `the dog ate my homework' letter&mdash;the dog in this case being the Western Australian parliament. To quote from his letter, Mr Kierath said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We introduced legislation to adopt the Medicare principles and commitments in 1994. Changes to the legislation necessitated the redrafting of the bill . . . I introduced the new draft legislation earlier this month, ie October 1995.</PARA>
<PARA>But, significantly, there has been no commitment to actually pass the legislation. It is a very different story when it comes to workers compensation legislation and industrial relations legislation which attacks the rights, security and living standards of families. What we have seen is the Court government using the guillotine, for the first time in 100 years in the Western Australian parliament, the guillotine to ensure the passage of that legislation. They are prepared to use it to slash conditions but not to improve conditions of Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attacks on families and workers were in place with the twinkling of a razor; they did it very quickly. But they cannot enshrine these principles of the Medicare agreement. It is either ministerial incompetence or they are actually introducing hurdles to make it harder. They believe that if this lot, the members opposite, were to be elected, they would not have to worry about these Medicare principles. They could then charge fees for hospital services, they could cut them back and they could deny access. So what we have seen from the Western Australian health minister&mdash;which he is on a part-time basis&mdash;is a refusal to pass these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look around the country, you can see similar performance. In fact, you can pick a Liberal-National health system just by the headlines. I would like to draw members' attention to a couple and see, for instance, how readily they can identify the government at fault. For instance, we have a headline `Hospital patient crisis to worsen'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the member for Reid, I have seen claims from the Leader of the Opposition that the radical changes that he proposes to make to the Australian labour market would boost productivity and that that would be the basis for rapidly increasing real wages. He said that in this House as recently as yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the Leader of the Opposition is a fan of the New Zealand changes. As he indicated earlier this year, he clearly saw the New Zealand National Party's labour market agenda as the prototype for his own agenda. He said in July:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our proposals are not a mirror image of the New Zealand proposals, but they are in the same category, they are of the same type.</PARA>
<PARA>So that is something we have got clear. Basically, the New Zealand model is not exactly what he is proposing, but it is the same sort of thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what has happened in the labour market in New Zealand over the last five years in terms of the kind of deregulation that they have had to see what it would be like under a John Howard government. They brought in their employment contracts act in the middle of 1991, which essentially put into place a system of widespread individual contracts. You can still have enterprise bargains, but individual contracts are very much promoted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did not take very long before the New Zealand workers found out what that system meant. Just one year after the act was introduced, a survey was undertaken by the Heylen Research Centre for the New Zealand Department of Labour. It showed that many New Zealand workers on new contracts suffered a significant loss of conditions. For instance, the survey showed that overtime rates had been reduced or abolished in 42 per cent of enterprises and raised in only seven per cent; that weekend rates had been cut in 43 per cent of cases and raised in three per cent; that special allowances were cut in 29 per cent and increased in 12 per cent; that sick leave was reduced in 15 per cent and raised in six per cent; that long service leave was cut in 16 per cent and raised in four per cent; and that the ability to accumulate leave was reduced in 29 per cent and improved in two per cent. There is not much doubt what the impact of the system was in terms of all of these areas of conditions of employment. It meant on a wide scale the loss of conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This business of saying, `Okay, you've now got this individual contract; you can go off and negotiate on an equal basis with an employer,' as though there was some sort of equality between a kid who left school and an employer of an enterprise in terms of a bargaining arrangement, is obviously a nonsense and results in these sorts of outcomes where those who are without bargaining power in the labour market find themselves having their conditions of employment stripped away. So that much is clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what happened in relation to productivity and real wages? In respect of productivity, we see that in New Zealand from 1990 to 1995 GDP per hour worked&mdash;which is about as comprehensive a basis as you can get for productivity improvement across the economy&mdash;increased by 2.7 per cent over five years. At the same time, in Australia it has increased by 8.6 per cent. It increased by 8.6 per cent against their 2.7 per cent. So much for this myth that this deregulation of the labour market leads to a whole new world of mushrooming productivity. It obviously did not happen there in the way that it happened in this country without that kind of severe deregulation and stripping away of conditions of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened in the manufacturing industry was even more astonishing. In manufacturing, output per person employed in New Zealand over the last five years has gone up by 3 1/2 per cent and in Australia by 23 per cent. It has gone up by 23 per cent in Australia as against 3 1/2 per cent in New Zealand. We are looking at very different productivity outcomes across the economy, particularly in manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to real wages? Over the last four years, real average weekly earnings in Australia increased by 5.1 per cent compared with an increase of just 0.7 per cent in New Zealand. In other words, in New Zealand this deregulation of the labour market has meant the stripping away of conditions of employment in a way which has never been seen in that country before and virtual stagnation of real wages. There is no great startling growth, no surge of real wage increases or no whole new light blooming in the workplaces of New Zealand in terms of higher incomes for workers. It just has not happened. Yet in Australia the growth of real wages has been much more significant under our system than it has been in New Zealand since the employment contracts legislation came into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the election was being held prior to these  employment contracts being brought in and the then opposition was running with this policy, what did they say the benefits of this policy would be? Increased real wages for New Zealand workers. When the Labour government said that there would be a stripping away of conditions of employment, they said, `Oh, that's just a Labour lie.' What happened after the election? Exactly what the Labour government said would happen: there was a stripping away of conditions of employment. What happened to productivity and real wages? Very little in terms of productivity and virtually nothing in terms of real wages. That is the New Zealand experience. That is what would happen in this country if John Howard had his way.</PARA>

Seven million dollars in the Free Enterprise Foundation. Who contributed to that we do not know. Seven million dollars from the great opponents of disclosure. You talk about access too. Remember the last election when there were those three tiers in the Intercontinental? On the top floor it was black tie and there were two tiers underneath it. John Hewson, the new Prime Minister, would wander down from floor to floor and devote a certain amount of time, according to the rate you paid. But they never got past the first floor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I did see an article by Brian Toohey which talks about product safety and barriers to trade. He clearly implies that Australians will have to accept inferior safety standards under APEC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Toohey has relied on a report by the APEC Eminent Persons Group but he has been very selective in his use of that document. The report suggests the idea of `tested once, accepted everywhere' but what Brian Toohey does not explain is that the report says that this is a guiding principle which can be put into practice only if all APEC members agree. That is, all governments would have to agree on that, and this government will never agree to anything which affects our high quality standards for products, particularly safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere does the report recommend that APEC members should be forced to accept unsafe products, nor does it say that members should not be able to set or enforce safety standards that suit their own citizens. That is exactly opposite to the implication in the article.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have to seriously question where Mr Toohey has been in the past year and the quality of his research because for the past 12 months I have certainly been talking publicly on numerous occasions, and in this House, on what my office and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs are doing to ensure product safety standards are not only upheld but improved as we go into the APEC area. We are developing what I call a `culture of safety' and this involves looking at the way we currently set safety standards for products to see if there is not a better way of doing it so that product safety standards do not themselves become barriers to trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have already gone down this path in Europe and they have found that if you develop safety standards based on the types of injuries caused rather than on an individual product basis, as we currently do in Australia, you can allow for more innovation while eliminating more dangerous products.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to be able to advise the House on the way in which the millions of dollars which have gone into the confiscated assets trust fund have been distributed. That fund was established in 1991 as a way of injecting money from those who have exploited Australia by criminal behaviour into the fight against crime. The fund is a key part of our goal as a federal government of making the Australian environment as hostile as possible for people who would wish to pursue criminal activity here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point is that taking organised crime's profits is the most effective disincentive to the committing of further crime. The federal government understands that organised crime has just one goal, and that is profit. Profit is the lifeblood of those groups. We have to do more than just put individual members of those groups behind bars; we have to attack the massive profits that those groups make. That is what our legislation does. It allows us to confiscate money and property from criminals and invest it back in a way that benefits the whole of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since December 1991, all funds recovered under proceeds of crimes legislation and provisions of the Customs Act have been paid into the confiscated assets trust fund. In all, more than $27 million has been available for allocation. The money is divided equally between law enforcement initiatives and, under the management of my colleague the Minister for Human Services and Health, strategies to reduce drug demand. The most appropriate way to use this money is, firstly, in strengthening our law enforcement purposes and our law enforcement agencies and, secondly, in improving this country's drug rehabilitation and drug education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members should know that this not only helps federal authorities but also, where there is successful cooperation between federal and state agencies, benefits state agencies. The way some of those benefits come about can be quite innovative. For example, earlier this year I was in Western Australia and was able to hand over a Beechcraft aircraft worth $150,000 to the Western Australian government, which is now using it as part of its law enforcement arrangements around Kalgoorlie, and it is proving to be a very useful adjunct to the Western Australian law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year we have been able to distribute about $5 1/2 million from the fund to law enforcement projects. The biggest grant of $1.8 million is going to the National Crime Authority; $1.4 million is going to the Australian Federal Police, part of which will be used to develop a computerised investigation system for document based cases; $130,000 is going to the Australian Securities Commission to enhance its database; $290,000 is going to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to improve its screening procedures; over half a million dollars is going to the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board to improve information sharing between federal law enforcement agencies; and grants of the nature of $411,000 are going to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence to develop software packages for easier access to criminal intelligence and to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission for fraud training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a whole range of projects. I have not been comprehensive in the total disbursements, but you can get a good sense of where the funding is going. An additional $5 1/2 million is going into drug rehabilitation and drug education programs. That, of course, is under the management of my colleague the Minister for Human Services and Health, and she will be making an announcement in that regard in the near future.</PARA>

The prime ministers of this country and I think also of New Zealand were singled out for that activity. So there is absolutely no lack of understanding in France as to where the government stands on this very important matter. The support we have managed to garner around the globe has already put enough pressure on the French to get them into a position on the comprehensive test ban which is far more satisfactory than the position they held before.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, they are missing a good answer, Geoff. The draft report says that it is not always going to reduce government outlays and it is not always going to improve the quality of services; that competitive tendering should be assessed on a case by case basis; and that doing it properly is a practical, pragmatic matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft report contains advice on how to conduct an open and fair tender process. It finds that the success of competitive tendering depends on the government clearly specifying what it expects the provider to deliver. The contract or tender process must be handled well. If it is not, competitive tendering may not be worth doing at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of this advice is commonsense, but there are instances where competitive tendering and contracting out have been a disaster. Last week I drew the attention of the House to the situation in Western Australia where a so-called tender was given to a builder to provide stevedoring services down at the port of Fremantle. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> over the weekend, under the headline `Port row memo ignored', had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberal supporter Len Buckeridge's company was hired by the Court government to handle stevedoring operations for Stateships against the advice of senior management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confidential Stateships documents reveal that Transport Minister Eric Charlton was warned that hiring Mr Buckeridge's company, BAAC Pty Ltd, to handle cargo at Fremantle would be a financial and industrial disaster.</PARA>
<PARA>As we all know, that is what it turned out to be. Something that was supposed to save the state $400,000 ended up costing the state economy $19 million, and they lost the Stateships service as well. If they had taken the advice of the Industry Commission on the ways in which they should go about tendering these services, then this fiasco would not have happened at all. But, of course, it was all about ideology. It was never about getting a fair tender. It was all about sticking the boot into the unions. Of course, they came unstuck, because the score at the end of the day was: unions, one; Western Australian government, zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy muddle in Western Australia is not only down at the waterfront but extends to the road transport charges. The Western Australian government is restructuring its road transport charges following an agreement to develop nationally consistent road regulations and charges. That is a very sensible reform, initiated by this government. Under this agreement, 90 per cent of the heavy vehicles in Western Australia will have lower charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, the minister&mdash;this is the same minister, Mr Eric Charlton&mdash;is saying that freight rates to the north-west of Western Australia will have to rise because of not only this agreement but also his old bogey: the national competition policy. It has nothing to do with national competition policy. All of the money that will come from this increase in charges goes directly to the Western Australian government. If the Western Australian government is concerned about the charges in the north-west of Western Australia, they can give the money back. They can give it back in a number of ways. They can give it directly to the communities if they want to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can see the pattern developing in Western Australia. It holds lessons for the federal opposition. Every time they make a decision, they are not proud of it. An example this year is with the privatisation of the water authority work. You would think there might be some good reason for doing that, but they blame it on national competition policy. It has nothing to do with it. You would think there would be a good reason for provoking the strike down at the waterfront. But, no. Once again, it is national competition policy. Privatising the Public Service. Are they proud of that? No. It must be this government forcing them to do it through the national competition policy. Also, the restructuring of the road transport charges was, once again, the fault of this government through the national competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am getting the feeling that, even though they signed up to the national competition policy, they do not understand it and are using it for a crutch. Could you imagine the situation if the federal opposition were to release their policies? There is very much the same thread running through; that is, they are ashamed of their policies. They always blame it on someone else and you can see why here, in the federal parliament, you cannot get a sniff of an opposition policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recent days, over eight million Australian contributors to a national compulsory superannuation scheme have been absolutely amazed to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of this country in this place and elsewhere call the very people that he has to depend upon for the administration of those funds `donkeys' or `lemmings'. That is the sort of terminology we expect to hear from the Prime Minister, but we do not expect those attacks to be made on the very people whom, since May of this year, he has endeavoured to extol as being the managers of the most wonderful scheme this nation has ever seen to ensure that future generations of Australians will be financially independent in their retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it absolutely clear at this stage that the coalition shares the government's objective of improving national savings and investment and retirement incomes. However, we do fear that the proposed system, as introduced by this government, does not necessarily meet those objectives, nor the savings needs of Australians, in a fair and efficient  way. It is for that reason that the matter of public importance before the House today&mdash;`the failure of the Prime Minister to consider and protect the retirement incomes of Australian workers'&mdash;is so absolutely necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 August last, at the launch of the national superannuation education campaign&mdash;an initiative of this government, paid for by the Australian taxpayer at a cost of $12.5 million&mdash;the Prime Minister described the purposes of the campaign as being `to tell people about superannuation, to involve them with it, to give them some confidence that the system is going to be managed well for them and is going to do good things'. Later on we have seen a scare campaign. That is what we have seen in the last few days, apparently to ensure that we see the `good things'&mdash;a little bit of the old tickle, get the old cat-o'-nine-tails out. Apparently, according to the Prime Minister, a bit of abuse here and there helps to tone people's imagination and their mental approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worrying thing is simply this: the Prime Minister is attacking the heart of the trusteeship system, which is the very basis of the superannuation arrangements of this nation. His attacks have ignored the reality that superannuation fund trustees have a fiduciary relationship to nobody except the contributors to those funds. They are accountable for forming an investment strategy that has regard to all aspects of the particular fund. The trustees also have the responsibility of representing members' interests. Consequently, if they fail, fund managers, appointed by trustees, are sacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Side by side with the fiduciary responsibilities are the obvious prudential supervision requirements. But above all trustees are required to invest solely for the purpose of providing a retirement benefit for fund members. The important thing is that the direction of the government's policy is quite clearly consistent with the position adopted by the ACTU some years ago in a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>. The basis of that policy put forward then and now carried through in this dubious way was to effectively take the savings of Australian workers and to direct them into social, economic or other priorities which the government of the day saw as being in its interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to hear a single member of this government, and certainly the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Elliott), who is at the table today, explain how it is possible to maintain trusteeship responsibilities on the one hand and at the same time to subvert those responsibilities to achieve the objectives of the government. The sole purpose obligation of trustees requires that superannuation investments be made only for the purpose of providing retirement benefits for fund members. Any deflection of superannuation investment from that primary purpose to achieve a socially worthwhile goal or any other goal established by government has the potential to negate the ability of superannuation to realise the retirement income policy objectives for which it has been founded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the confidence of the Australian people in the superannuation policies of this government is falling? In November 1994 the Australian Consumers Council found that 50 per cent of those surveyed believed that superannuation was a poor investment. Several months later Assirt Investment Research warned that confidence in superannuation was falling to crisis levels. In March 1995 the survey showed a further seven per cent fall in the number of people who regarded it as a good investment. Why is this? This survey set down in considerable detail what the responses of people were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey identified a number of reasons for this lack of confidence. Since the Labor Party won power in 1983, there have been over 2,000 major changes to superannuation rules and regulations. The ensuing lack of stability has left many consumers fearful of the security of their investment. The changes have also made our superannuation system one of the most complex in the Western world. A large number of contributors were frustrated by the lack of control and access to their funds. They felt that their financial outcome was entirely in the hands of government or of the funds and that they had no control, while many others were concerned about the erosion of their accounts by fees and government charges&mdash;and well they might. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 May 1995, the day after the budget was brought down, our glorious intrepid Prime Minister went on Triple J. It is very important to note the audience that he was talking to. Youth unemployment in this country is now 27 per cent. The group which is affected most by that is those between 15 and 19&mdash;exactly the same people listen to Triple J. This is what the Prime Minister told them:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . your audience&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the 15- and 19-year-olds listening to him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be the first generation of Australians in our history who will have security right through, that is economic security, right through their working lives and beyond.</PARA>
<PARA>Whom is he trying to convince&mdash;the young people listening to him, the 27 per cent-plus of young people who are unemployed in this country today, or perhaps their parents who are wondering whether being forced into a system developed by the government is such a good idea after all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Prime Minister was not in any way put off by this. On 8 August, in terms of his national superannuation education program and to convince people about what a good thing the government's policy was, he said that `someone on average weekly earnings&mdash;someone on about $32,000 to $33,000&mdash;will retire with a lump sum of just under half a million dollars'. What the public was sold before the last election was legislated tax cuts to commence on 1 January. They were worth $1.8 billion for the first half year and $4 billion in a full year. What the public received was an unfunded promise that most workers would receive a co-payment of up to $1,000 which would lead to a long and prosperous retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister is saying to people commencing to work in the next century&mdash;and I emphasise `in the next century'&mdash;is that they will retire on more money or a similar amount of money as they earned. That is wonderful. But that is under one important condition. Are those people going to be working? The very basis of the Prime Minister's formula was that they were going to be working for 40 years without a break&mdash;with a four per cent investment return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can you explain to the people of Australia? How can you explain to the 25 per cent of people who have recently been in that lucky number to have found jobs that they are in part-time jobs? What I am simply pointing out to the House is this: we are not talking about 100 per cent of the work force who can be guaranteed full-time employment for 30 or 40 years, when the evidence before the Australian people today is as clear as a pikestaff that there will be a growing percentage of them in part-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the emphasis of the superannuation program is simply this: that the end benefits were based on the presumption of full-time employment and the presumption of a gradually but steadily rising wage. Today you have 800,000-odd Australians who are unemployed. To tell those people that the superannuation program of this government will give them milk and honey in retirement is gross. It is a gross insult to the integrity of those people, who ask for nothing except the right to work&mdash;the one right that has been denied them by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation does not carry the same Commonwealth commitment as do bank deposits. But this Prime Minister assures everybody that the system works so well that what goes in will be multiplied over and over and come out as that fantastic figure of half a million dollars per working person. How can he relate that to the women of Australia&mdash;the hundreds and thousands of women who are now in the work force whose average salary levels are well below those of males in the same industry, whose expectation of work is substantially less because of family requirements?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your policy does nothing at all for those people. Your so-called small payments system is a sham. It is based on the presumption that, if you had three or four jobs&mdash;and that is often the situation faced by those women&mdash;you now can consolidate your old funds into one fund; well and good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the next situation: many of those women are working for more than one employer, but they are not allowed to consolidate their funds because your trade union mates will not let them do so. And what is the outcome of that? It is quite simple: unnecessary fees and taxes. And what is the outcome of all of that? At the end of the day those people have very little&mdash;certainly not half a million dollars! Let me give an example from a letter which was written to me by one woman. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have recently received my benefit statement as at 31 December 1994 and was appalled to see that my total retirement credit had shrunk from $640.46&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a very wealthy person; she will certainly be getting half a million dollars&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">contributed by my employer to $426.62 as shown in the following calculations.</PARA>
<PARA>The contribution tax that that person paid on that very small amount of money was $88.28. She began with $640; she ended with $426. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a worse case here&mdash;worse, despite the $12.5 million spent in an advertising program. This woman was 65 years of age. She did not have to be forced into superannuation, but she was. What does she have to show for it? This woman's account had eroded to $250. But she was over 65, and no-one told her that she could access her money. So between the ages of 55 and 65 she continued to pay the charges and taxes that were levied unnecessarily&mdash;year in and year out. At the end of the day, she finally wrote to her member of parliament and said, `What sort of a system is this? I'm going backwards and I'm 65 years of age!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that so many Australians no longer have confidence in this government and no longer have confidence in the system which is quite obviously incapable of looking after their interests either now or in the future? The whole promise of the superannuation proposal as put forward by the government is a sham. We support superannuation; we support savings. You have to when you consider that in 1983 this government inherited a national foreign debt of $23 billion, yet here we are in 1995 owing $180 billion&mdash;an increase of 800 per cent on what Australians now owe the world. Yes, we have to save, but you as a government have got no right to be giving the Australian people such a dubious bill of sale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not much detail in your speeches either&mdash;no more detail than there was today. Clearly the opposition's approach at this stage is no more than the freeze on the superannuation guarantee or no more than their approach when they were last in office where superannuation was very much the prerogative of the privileged few. It was either the public sector or a small segment of the non-public sector work force that had superannuation arrangements. Indeed, superannuation coverage at that time stood at about 40 per cent of the work force, with very substantial tax concessions to those on high incomes. For the vast majority of the work force, there was no superannuation access at all. Today, 93 per cent of the population has superannuation. The number of women&mdash;the member for Bradfield referred to this&mdash;with superannuation has grown from about 25 per cent in 1983 to 85 per cent today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation has become increasingly important. The fact that we have the debates that we do on superannuation is by virtue of the fact that the government has a comprehensive strategy&mdash;a strategy where superannuation is designed to have a dual impact: firstly, to boost national savings and, secondly, to ensure that we do have comprehensive retirement income strategies built around the significant contribution that the superannuation guarantee arrangements have provided; that is, phasing through to nine per cent by the year 2002. The important budget initiatives this year provide for a three per cent employee contribution, phasing in at one per cent per year from 1997, and a matching contribution from the government, phasing in at that time, to achieve a total contribution of 15 per cent by the year 2002. The impact of that will be immense in terms of both savings and retirement income strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will ensure that retirement incomes are maximised. Those who have a long period in the work force obviously will get a substantial benefit from superannuation. People who have 30 to 40 years in the work force at the 15 per cent rate will clearly have a big retirement income through superannuation. But we should not assume, as the opposition often tries to, that only those who will be in the work force for 40 years will get a benefit. The studies and the models that are being done show that people will be able to get a combination in their age pension&mdash;part-age pension and part-superannuation&mdash;and that they will get a higher retirement income through these arrangements than they would have got had they not had any superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983, the opposition was quite happy to have 60 per cent of the work force with no superannuation coverage at all. Many people in my electorate and the electorate of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is in the House, did not get superannuation at all under the regime that was the previous government's approach. We now come to what the government is doing and this matter of public importance, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of the Prime Minister to consider and protect  the retirement  incomes  of  Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA>What a load of nonsense. The fact of the matter is that the government has continually taken steps to protect and ensure that the prudential arrangements for superannuation are enhanced. There has been a series of measures. The member for Bradfield referred to the fact that there have been a number of changes as far as superannuation is concerned. What have those changes been designed to do? They have been designed to provide more security, provide a strengthening of the role of the regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, ensure accountability to fund members and ensure that we do have a regime which is delivering outcomes to fund members and puts clear responsibility on the trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing that has been said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or anyone else has suggested that we are seeking to walk away in any sense from that clear trustee responsibility. Indeed, when we are having a debate about this issue it is probably worth while that I refer briefly to a few of the things that the current act provides for. In the area of the covenants to be included in the governing rules of the funds, the act says, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to formulate and give effect to an investment strategy that has regard to the whole of the circumstances of the entity including, but not limited to, the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)the risk involved in making, holding and realising, and the likely return from, the entity's investments having regard to its objectives and its expected cash flow requirements;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)the composition of the entity's investments as a whole including the extent to which the investments are diverse or involve the equity in being exposed to risk from inadequate diversification;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)the liquidity of the entity's investments having regard to its expected cash flow requirements;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv)the availability of the entity to discharge its existing and prospective liabilities;</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing that has been suggested by the government moves away from that. The SIS regime makes it clear that it is the responsibilities of the trustees to develop a diversified investment strategy and to account for that to</PARA>
<PARA>fund members. We are saying quite clearly, as we have done repeatedly, that it is the trustees' responsibility to do that. We are also saying they need to ensure that fund investment is diversified and the risk spectrum is spread. Investment should not be made through an unimaginative approach which has all the investment located in a handful of blue-chip stocks. It needs to be spread across the range of opportunities that a prudent financial fund manager should be seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is gradually occurring. The key thing that we have been saying is that we are keen to ensure that process is done well, that those fund managers who have been setting the best practice standard are not an isolated few&mdash;in fact, that they become the norm for fund managers&mdash;and that we keep enhancing that best practice strategy. That is what this whole debate is about. It is not about in any sense removing the trustees' obligations and the duties they clearly have under the act. No-one has suggested anything of the sort. Rather, it is about trying to ensure we get the very best outcomes, because trustees do, in many instances, seek the direct involvement of the fund managers in ensuring their fulfilment of investment strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law makes it clear that the trustees are entitled to engage people to assist in delivering the outcomes that their responsibilities require. But we want to ensure that we do not have the situation that occurred in 1994, when funds did not perform as well as they should have because a lot of fund managers sold bonds to the detriment of fund members. Things can be done better than in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things we have been seeking to do is ensure that the education program that the member for Bradfield referred to is focused on trustees getting across their obligations. We are seeking to ensure the range of new trustees who have come in since the law was enacted are fully aware of all their obligations and all the opportunities that exist for them to help to contribute to this dynamic industry in the best possible way. This will help ensure we get the best fund performance at the end of the day for superannuation fund assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government has taken a whole range of measures in this area. The substantial enhancement of the powers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission adds to that protection and that security without, in any sense, obviating the trustees' legal fiduciary duties. For instance, the annual report of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission tabled in the parliament showed that nearly 800 fund audits had been conducted in the last year by the ISC. These fund audits included funds of all different sizes and arrangements. The ISC concluded from that that most funds are run satisfactorily. There certainly were some shortcomings, but they were of a minor nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funds, as the ISC has reported, were overwhelmingly receptive to fixing measures where any problems arose. Where there were particular problems that the ISC needed to pursue, funds were not backward in taking such action. For instance, money is being restored to one fund which had been embezzled by its financial controller. The financial controller's actions have been referred to the New South Wales police. A small investment manager in Queensland has been referred to the Queensland police. A Queensland auditor has been banned from auditing superannuation funds as a result of the ISC's actions. There has also been a commitment on the part of the government&mdash;indeed, the legislation will be debated later this week in the parliament&mdash;to ensure a strengthening of the external audit provisions as far as the act is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The whole reporting requirements in relation to superannuation have been improved dramatically. Members, on joining a fund, get details about what the fund's arrangements are, what the investment strategy is and what prospective fund members can expect from it. They then get an annual statement with details about the fund and its performance over that year. In addition, on leaving a fund, they get a detailed statement of what the fund asset has achieved during the members' time in the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government has taken very strong measures to protect small superannuation balances. This was one of the big things the member for Bradfield mentioned in his contribution. The member for Bradfield talked about someone who got a statement in December 1994 relating to the erosion of their superannuation through fees and charges. The government identified that problem early. The fact is that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) made a statement on 28 June 1994 indicating that action was being taken by the government to resolve that. New measures came into effect from 1 July this year to protect small superannuation balances from being eroded by fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience the member for Bradfield referred to cannot, as he well knows, be repeated because there are now protective measures that prevent that from happening. Those measures mean that the industry has had to provide protection for small superannuation balances. When we make a comparison with other forms of investment, can we see any other form of investment which has that same protection against fees and charges in the way that now applies to superannuation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, when people still are not satisfied with the complaint handling arrangements from a fund, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal can now deal with those complaints in a fair, efficient and quick method. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will have its powers strengthened by legislation, which is in the House this week, to ensure that it can deal with medical evidence matters and matters to do with personal superannuation products from life offices. So all of those key things that have been introduced to add to the protection of the superannuation regime and the protection of the savings of Australians have contributed to superannuation in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then we come to trying to ensure that, as those superannuation assets grow, fund managers have the diversity and the imagination to ensure innovation through fund performance over time. We do encourage the funds not to take too much of a short-term view. We do encourage the community not to be too focused by the short-term fund performance for one year. We do encourage action to see superannuation as the long-term savings vehicle that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only in the last couple of weeks I have indicated that measures will be taken to ensure superannuation fund performance is measured not just in an annual statement perspective but also in five-yearly measures that provide insights into fund performance over the longer term. It is all part of encouraging this broadening and deepening of the superannuation industry investment strategy. We want to provide access to superannuation and to improve the performance for the fund member to make sure super works most effectively for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 85 per cent of superannuation assets today are being reinvested in Australia. We need to ensure that, both within that 85 per cent and the many not currently being invested in Australia, we get the breadth of investment across both blue-chip and green-chip companies. The net benefit needs to flow through to small and medium sized businesses and to the whole community rather than in a narrow phase of investment, as some criticise the industry for at the moment. All of these things point to the government's achievements in the area of superannuation policy for all Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to this federal government, in every backyard throughout the land&mdash;the length and breadth of Australia&mdash;a new tree is going to spring up somewhere alongside the disused incinerator and the old lemon bush. The tree is a money tree, growing higher and more dense every day with fresh green banknotes. The government even puts out a depiction of this in its booklet about superannuation&mdash;the money tree that is going to grow up in your backyard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This of course is your compulsory superannuation account into which a projected 15 per cent of your income will go by the year 2002. The problem is, at least in this country, that banknotes are not green, unless you are talking about monopoly money, and there are many reasons for believing that this superannuation scheme will have much more in common with the disused incinerator or the lemon tree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's compulsory superannuation scheme has been widely spruikered throughout the country in a $12.5 million advertising campaign. It is all part of the phoney election war that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is fighting at present. But it is actually heavy on fairy tale and very light on realism. The fairy tale goes a bit like this: if you pay your hard won readies into a superannuation fund, at the end of 40 years of diligent contributions you will find a pot of gold at the end of the superannuation rainbow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against the backdrop a few weeks ago of the Berlei lingerie factory, the erstwhile David Jones suit salesman, now Prime Minister Paul Keating, told the assembled throng of ordinary workers on average weekly earnings that they would find half a million dollars in their pots of superannuation gold at the end of their working lives. The setting chosen for this announcement was cynical in the extreme, because women top the list of great losers in a scheme that prioritises superannuation at the expense of all other savings vehicles. The fairy tale presented in the budget is that everyone is employed, everyone is a member of a couple, everyone works for an unbroken 40 years and that the real rate of return on superannuation funds will be four per cent. But of course the reality is very different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with some of the assumptions which underlie the government's superannuation policy. Firstly, the scheme assumes that a person starts to work at the age of 25 and continues to the age of 65 without a break. But we all know that up to one-third of workers are being thrown out of work at the age of 50 in Australia. We know that women spend on average 18 years in the work force, compared with an average of 39 years for men. In fact current research suggests that, even with predicted future increases in female labour force participation, women will spend no more than 28 years on average in paid employment&mdash;a long way short of the 40 years on which this scheme is based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women's earnings are still much lower than men's. They are also disproportionately concentrated among low-paid workers. In Australia, nearly 50 per cent of female employees are in just three occupations: typists and stenographers, sales assistants and data processing. As a result of broken employment and low levels of lifetime income, women accumulate insubstantial superannuation earnings. On average, male superannuation fund members of retirement age have superannuation assets double those of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retirement income modelling task force estimated that, even with the improvements in superannuation cover under the superannuation guarantee charge, women will accrue only around half the benefits of men because of differences in average earning levels and paid work force participation patterns. Yet, interestingly, the budget makes the assumption that `most people will go through their working life and retire as a member of a couple'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second assumption is that you are guaranteed an adequate retirement income from your superannuation. But, as anybody who has looked at superannuation even in the slightest degree can attest, there is no guarantee of any particular return on your money. The result depends on a range of factors. If the fund fails, as did Beneflex in Queensland, people will find that the money tree has shed all its leaves and died during a spell of economic permafrost. So much for that assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third assumption is that everybody goes into retirement with a partner. In fact, as I said before, this is cited in the budget documentation itself. Yet we know in Australia that four in 10 marriages end in separation and divorce over a lifetime, with women tending to take a share of their former partner's superannuation at the time of the separation and divorce to provide immediate income or to pay off their share of the house&mdash;leaving nothing for them in old age. In fact, five per cent of women 45 years old and over in Australia have never married. In the 1991 census, the last census figures available, over one million Australians were living alone. So this assumption that the scheme is based upon&mdash;that everybody goes into retirement with a partner&mdash;is simply factually wrong and therefore undermines the scheme for many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the government is assuming that inflation will be three per cent a year, wages will grow by four per cent and investment earnings after fees and charges will be seven per cent a year. Yet, if you look at the details from the funds themselves, according to the Association of Superannuation Funds the 30-year real rate of return as to 30 June last year was just 2.6 per cent a year. Clearly the volatility of markets affects the returns year by year. A 30-year return rate of just 2.8 per cent is far below what has been assumed as the basis of this fund: the assumptions upon which the Prime Minister says to the people of Australia, `You're going to get in 2041'&mdash;mind you&mdash;`if you've worked for 40 years, something like half a million.' The assumption is simply wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the government promotes this scheme as being fair to all Australians. But the tax levied on contributions and fund earnings is a flat tax. Women, who earn less and on average work many fewer years, will receive nowhere near the amounts that have been suggested by the Prime Minister. The scheme favours dual income families over single income families. The bulk of tax concessions on employers' contributions flow through to men, and disproportionately to high income earners. Young savers and low income earners will have the problem of generating enough savings to pay off the house mortgage well before retirement age and having backup savings in the event of an emergency such as a redundancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACOSS, in a report which was released in October 1995, heavily criticises the government and says, `Basically what we are talking about is a highly flawed scheme.' In fact their summary is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, the superannuation scheme as it currently stands is deeply flawed and highly risky.</PARA>
<PARA>ACOSS&mdash;representing the welfare sector, representing the poor, representing the people whom this government and this Prime Minister pretend to represent&mdash;says that this is a totally flawed scheme. Yet you have the government running around spending $12.5 million to convince people that they should be in a compulsory scheme. Think of the absurdity of that. ACOSS and a whole group of agencies recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many low income people will be forced to give up an unjustifiably large amount of their wages during times, such as child rearing, when their basic expenses are highest. Yet the scheme will provide these people with little or no extra assistance in retirement, while offering very large improvements for many wealthier people.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the judgment of ACOSS. This is a scheme which is flawed. As the previous speaker for the coalition said, there is no question on the part of the coalition that we need a retirement incomes saving policy, but we need a policy that is not merely political rhetoric and not merely a slogan which is exercised by the Prime Minister. We need a policy which will work and which will deliver true benefits to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from being a tree upon which money will grow&mdash;you will believe that if you believe that there are fairies at the bottom of the garden&mdash;in this country, this is something akin to a lemon tree and that is the way people will see it as years go by. Far from providing certainty and security for the people of Australia which they can look forward to in their retirement, this is a scheme which will just contribute to the anxiety of Australians who already feel a great degree of insecurity about the way in which this country is being led. Nothing in this legislation, nothing in this proposal and nothing in this scheme will remove the anxiety of any Australians looking forward to their retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They did not refer to this as a totally flawed scheme. In some of those nitpicking points that you chose to refer to there may have been some substance. But you should not just look at nitpicking points; you should look for the substance itself. You have to look for the substance. That was why I simply could not believe that the opposition would come forward and draw the attention of the parliament and the national community to an area where they had been so deficient. I will remind you about that as briefly as I can. It needs to be said and it needs to be repeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in this parliament in 1983 and before, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have mentioned those wage plugs up in my electorate. You people who were in government did not give people the opportunity to have any access to superannuation benefits, to supplement their age pensions when they retired and to give them that bit of extra retirement income, security and comfort. No fear, you did not. Why then would you draw the attention of the national community to the fact that in 1983 only 40 per cent of Australian wage and salary earners had any access to superannuation? Why would you want to remind them? Why in the process would you want to remind them that the percentage of women wage and salary earners in Australia in 1983 who had access to superannuation was 25 per cent? Why would you want to remind them? I will tell you what we want to remind them about. That 40 per cent that we inherited from you is now 90 per cent. That 25 per cent of women that we inherited from you is now 85 per cent. You know that your superannuation arrangements were not only income discriminatory because they were available to the richest, the wealthiest and the highest income earners in the community, but they were also gender discriminatory because they were not available to women. There were 25 per cent of them under you and 85 per cent under us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell honourable members two of the reasons why 87 per cent of the Australian community endorsed the superannuation arrangements that exist in Australia. First, because they have been reformed and they have been reformed well. Secondly, our approach has been articulated and it has been articulated well by that fellow sitting at the dispatch box&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. He has had the particular responsibility for the carriage of these arrangements. He has been able to take them through all the caucus committees and through the cabinet and into this parliament. He has taken it out there to the national community as well and 87 per cent of those people out there&mdash;100 per cent in my electorate of Charlton&mdash;endorse it and applaud his efforts because both he and this government gave them an opportunity to have access to superannuation benefits which will provide all of that additional security that they should have in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise some of the essential elements which underpin our whole approach to the question of retirement income. The claim that was made in this matter of public importance refers to the government's failure to consider and protect the retirement incomes of Australian workers. That is why I could not believe it. The parliamentary secretary will confirm that I said to him, `They can't be serious. Is that really what they're bringing forward as an MPI today?', despite my regard for the member for Bradfield. We all know what has happened in the electorate of Bradfield. Why your colleagues, as I have said to him before, would choose to see you leave this place is beyond me. There will not be anyone on the opposition side who knows anything about superannuation. I do not always agree with you, as you know, and I have not agreed with you today. I think your colleague has been nitpicking and I am surprised that you would bring this question to the attention of the national community. But you do know something about superannuation and you will not be here after the next election. They might engage you as a consultant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the points which underpin our whole approach to superannuation or to retirement security: first of all, the safety net of the age pension. We made sure that reached 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, and we are keeping it there. No-one in Australia falls through that safety net. In addition to that, we made sure that we will supplement it as a result of superannuation. First of all, there is compulsory&mdash;that is what it is, deliberately so&mdash;industry superannuation, with the agreement of the ACTU and the trade unions, because the employees themselves have forgone wages in order to contribute to their own superannuation in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also made sure that the prudential controls and supervision of funds will be sufficient to safeguard the owners of those funds. They are the people who are making the contributions. By the year 2000, there will be $1 million million in superannuation funds and they should be managed: they should as far as possible be directed to productive investment in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a contribution to the debate on this important bill&mdash;the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1995. The bill will restructure the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation in the following form: the HLIC will be reconstituted as a new government owned company established under the Corporations Law and subject to regulation by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. As is presently the case, the new company's non-borrowing liabilities will be government guaranteed; the new company will be fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the ISC; the HLIC's existing portfolio of insurance policies&mdash;the `old book'&mdash;will at the time of its restructure become the responsibility of the Commonwealth in exchange for which the Commonwealth will receive the HLIC's capital and reserves; and the new HLIC company will be contracted by the Commonwealth to manage the run-off of the old book. Claims arising from the old book will be met from the future budget outlays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also repeal the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965, which originally established the HLIC, as well as the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990, which provided the authority for the Commonwealth to sell the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation to a private organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fairly innocuous bill until you get down to the financial impact. The estimated financial implications of the proposal are as follows: an estimated negative outlay to the budget of approximately $100 million in 1995-96, reflecting the return to the Commonwealth of the HLIC's capital and financial reserves after allowance for the capitalisation costs of the new HLIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talk about deja vu&mdash;it has all the hallmarks of the Cain-Kirner years in the Victorian parliament and the Labor government which took control of the Victorian parliament in 1982. How well I recall that time when the labor government, the Cain government, was elected to power in Victoria. All the smart financial experts of the Australian Labor Party came into government and they were going to play Larry Dooley. They were going to empty all of the hollow logs in the Victorian statutory authorities. The hollow logs that they referred to were all of the reserve funds in a range of things like water boards and hospitals. They were going to teach us how modern money management worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How well I remember the Hon. David White, who was then the finance spokesman in the upper house in Victoria, the Hon. Bill Landeryou, the industry spokesman at that time, and the Hon. Rob Jolly, who was the Treasurer of Victoria, and all their claims about how they would manage the finances of Victoria. They managed them all right. Forty-two thousand million dollars of debt and accumulated liabilities later, the Labor government in Victoria were drummed out of office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The genesis of the hollow logs theory came about as a result of the setting up of a public bodies review committee under the chairmanship of Dr Kevin Foley. That committee was pretty well represented by people such as David White from the ALP, Steve Crabb from the ALP, and Rob Jolly&mdash;all of those people who thought they knew something about modern money management, as they termed it. The implication was they would get all this money out of the hollow logs&mdash;out of the water boards, where they had reserves for the future requirements of their operations, and out of hospital reserve funds&mdash;and put it to good use. That may have sounded all right in theory, but in practice their financial skills were incompetent. Here we see the federal government going down a similar path&mdash;$100 million out of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation in capital and financial reserves. That is what the government has its eye on&mdash;the financial reserves of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the ALP government are desperate for money in the federal sphere, as they were in 1982 when they came into government in Victoria. They were going to do big things in Victoria. They believed that they could put these reserve funds to good use, as they called it. Instead of having some reserves to fall back on in difficult financial times, or in times of expansion by water boards when providing additional infrastructure and facilities for the delivery of water to a whole range of areas throughout Victoria&mdash;and any building programs that hospitals might have retained reserve funds for&mdash;using the modern money management techniques of the state ALP under the Cain-Kirner government, what they did was pirate all that money and waste it. They put it into all the shonky schemes that they could dream up. In fact, they frittered away the magnificent reserves that had been accumulated over the Bolte, Hamer and Thompson years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they ultimately went out of government in 1992, just 10 years later, not only had those reserve funds been plundered from those authorities but also the government had got themselves into a situation of having $42,000 million of debt and unfunded liabilities. Victoria is still reeling from the impact of the losses and debt that were accumulated by these so-called financial whiz-kids. They were hopelessly out of their depth. The thing that concerns me about the tactic being used by the government for the acquisition of capital and financial reserves from the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation is that the same thing could occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the minister handling this bill will come into the House and explain what that $100 million will be used for. The capitalisation costs of setting up the new Housing Loans Insurance Corporation should not be too great. The question is: what happens to the balance of that money? If the government employ anything like the modern money management techniques of the former Labor government in Victoria, that does not augur well for the taxpayers, or for the people who have been using the services of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation to insure their loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to bring that matter to the attention of the House because I have had first-hand knowledge of what happened in the Victorian parliament and of the frightful waste of money that went on during the period of the Tricontinental debacle, the shonky loans involved with the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, and the Pyramid housing funds debacle. There was a succession of failures and mismanagement of money. They all accumulated and, ultimately, the Labor Party in Victoria were drummed out of office for their deplorable financial management and the debt and liability they created for Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admittedly, the statutory authorities involved in Victoria were different from the one we are discussing. They consisted of water boards, hospitals and organisations like that. But their reserve funds were put there for a very good purpose: to ensure the financial viability of those organisations to meet with any crisis that might occur or for use for any planning or construction works that might be required. To rob those statutory reserves&mdash;which is what the Labor government did at the time&mdash;and put the money into some of the schemes that the government did was culpable negligence in the management of the finances of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process put in place in the John Cain years was continued when Premier Joan Kirner took over. At one stage, their financial management got so out of hand that the money to pay their public sector employees was on a merry-go-round. Departments were paying staff from other departments. It was not unusual for the police force to be paid with a cheque from the education department, and vice versa. They even got to the stage of not paying their bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation, forests and lands department, at the time Joan Kirner was minister, left 180,000 accounts unpaid for over 12 months. The accounts accumulated and, eventually, the situation was brought to the attention of the state parliament. The traders, who had been holding these debts for the Victorian Labor government, finally blew the whistle on them. That added to the government's problems and, ultimately, led to their dismissal from office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the minister is listening to my comments about the use of financial reserves and capital from statutory authorities. I trust that the government has a mechanism in place whereby that $100 million can be put to better use than the use it was put to by the Victorian state government during the Cain-Kirner years from 1982 to 1992. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1995-96 budget included a number of measures relating to capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments relating to value shifting</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes amendments to division 19A of part IIIA, which operates to prevent the creation of capital losses or reduction of capital gains realised on the disposal of shares or loans in a company. Losses can be created, or gains reduced, by shifting value out of the shares or loans through the transfer of assets to commonly owned companies for low or nil consideration. Where a value shift is taken to have occurred, the cost bases of shares and loans in the transferor company are reduced to reflect the transferred value. The proposed amendments will generally operate to reduce the costs for taxpayers in complying with division 19A and to rectify certain anomalies in its current operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compliance costs will be reduced by enabling companies to transfer depreciable assets generally at their written down value, without the need to make cost base adjustments, provided that the market value of the assets is not substantially greater. Companies will also be able to group some assets that are transferred rather than deal with them on an asset by asset basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A simplified test will also be applied for assets acquired prior to the time at which the transferor and transferee companies came under common ownership. This measure will simplify the operation of the law, reduce uncertainty and thereby reduce compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An anti-avoidance measure is included in the bill so that division 19A will apply to the creation and transfer of rights relating to an asset where the asset has not itself been transferred. Where the consideration for the transfer of the new asset is less than its market value, a value shift will be taken to have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also make a number of other technical amendments to division 19A. These amendments, which will have no significant impact on revenue, will apply to transfers of assets after 7.30 p.m. AEST on 9 May 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>Increase in personal use asset thresholds</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill increases the thresholds applicable to both listed and non-listed personal use assets to $500 and $10,000 respectively. The amendment to increase the thresholds for listed and non-listed personal use assets will apply to disposals of assets occurring on or after 1 July 1995. The amendments will result in a cost to revenue of up to $2 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxable Australian assets</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will clarify the provisions relating to the disposal of certain taxable Australian assets. Some taxpayers have argued that gains on the disposal of taxable Australian assets used solely to produce franked dividends or income subject to withholding tax in Australia&mdash;such as certain shares in Australian companies and assets used in a permanent establishment in Australia&mdash;are not subject to capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This interpretation of the law is contrary to the clear intention of parliament. The amendments will ensure that capital gains tax will apply appropriately to disposals by non-residents of all taxable Australian assets and, thereby, will give effect to the intention underlying the existing law. They will apply to disposals of taxable Australian assets on or after 20 September 1985, which is the date from which capital gains tax applies. The financial impact of this measure is unquantifiable. </PARA>
<PARA>Exempt receipts</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains measures that will extend the existing capital gains tax relief which applies to a gain realised on the disposal of shares in a foreign company where the disposal also gives rise to a tax exempt non-portfolio dividend. The capital gain is reduced by the amount of the exempt dividend as though the dividend was taxable. Currently, capital gains tax relief applies in relation to the disposal of shares in foreign companies which were created after 25 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes that capital gains tax relief will also be available in relation to disposals of shares in foreign companies where the shares were created before 26 June 1992. This measure will apply to disposals occurring from the 1990-91 year of income, which is the year from which the exemption provided for non-portfolio dividends also applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A related measure will ensure that disposals of shares which take place after 7.30 p.m. AEST on 9 May 1995 and which give rise to non-portfolio dividends from foreign companies which are exempt from income tax, will only qualify for capital gains tax relief to the extent that the dividends are not paid out of a share capital account, share premium account or revaluation reserve of the foreign company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also modifies the existing general capital gains tax relief which applies in relation to gains realised on the disposal of assets where a capital amount is expressly included, in whole or in part, in the assessable income of a taxpayer. The existing general capital gains tax relief will be modified to apply specifically to disposals of rights to receive eligible termination payments. The amendments will apply to disposals taking place after 7.30 p.m. AEST on 9 May 1995. The financial impact of these measures is unquantifiable. </PARA>
<PARA>Compulsory rollover of assets</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will provide that, where a company disposes of an asset to a related company and the disposal would give rise to a capital loss, a compulsory capital gains tax rollover will generally apply in relation to the transfer of the asset. An exception is provided, subject to safeguards, where the company into which the loss asset is transferred is to be sold or floated within a specified time period. These amendments will apply to transfers of assets between related companies taking place after 7.30 p.m. AEST on 9 May 1995. They will prevent a potentially significant risk to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment or replacement of trust deeds</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that a capital gains tax rollover will be available in relation to the disposal of the assets of a complying approved deposit fund that would otherwise occur as a consequence of the conversion of the ADF to a complying superannuation fund. A rollover will also be available in relation to a disposal of the assets of an existing complying ADF or complying superannuation fund where the trust deed of the ADF or superannuation fund is amended or replaced in order to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rollover will be available only where there is no change in the assets of the fund or interest of members in the fund as a consequence of the conversion of the ADF to a superannuation fund, or the amendment or replacement of the trust deed of the ADF or superannuation fund. This measure will apply to disposals of assets taking place on or after 12 January 1994, the date from which certain amendments to the CGT relating to settlements of trusts and transfers of property to trusts took effect. The revenue impact of this proposal is insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividend imputation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the dividend imputation provisions as a result of the increase in the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent with effect from the 1995-96 income year. The amendments, which will apply from 1 July 1995, will allow companies to record franking credits and debits and distribute imputation credits to shareholders by reference to tax paid at 36 per cent. The value of existing 33 per cent and 39 per cent franking credits will be preserved for shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will reduce compliance costs for most companies because they will convert from the present dual franking account system to a single franking account. The bill will also correct certain defects in the current dividend imputation provisions relating to life insurance companies. The amendments will apply from the time the defects in the current provisions first arose. One amendment will prevent an unintended gain to the revenue and the other amendment will prevent a significant potential loss to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the dividend imputation amendments, the bill also provides for the calculation of class C franking deficit tax and deficit deferral tax. These taxes are imposed by the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill 1995 and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Amendment Bill 1995 respectively. These separate bills are required for constitutional reasons. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Franking credits&mdash;international profit misallocation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1995-96 budget the government announced a measure to deny franking credits for profit shifting adjustments. Under the current imputation system for company taxation, transfer pricing or non-arms-length dealing adjustments resulting in additional tax payable by an Australian resident company will give rise to a franking credit. This provision of a franking credit largely negates the additional tax payable by the resident company because the profits, which have been taxed under the transfer pricing and non-arms-length dealing adjustment provisions, have already been shifted or misallocated offshore and are not actually in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the franking credits arising from the payment of the additional company tax assessed as a result of the transfer pricing adjustments can be used to frank profit distributions that would not otherwise be franked dividends and subject to the relevant tax relief measures. The proposed amendment will ensure that the Australian revenue is not disadvantaged by international transfer pricing practices or non-arms-length dealings which misallocate or shift profits offshore. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Demutualisation of insurance companies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced in the 1995-96 budget that specific taxation measures would be introduced for the demutualisation of mutual life and general insurance companies. These measures are proposed in this bill. The bill provides that a demutualisation may occur under a specified method and then describes the taxation consequences of certain transactions which may occur in the course of the demutualisation. All of the methods of demutualisation require that the interests of members in the mutual company will be extinguished in exchange for ordinary shares in the demutualised company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that capital gains tax will not apply to the surrender by a member of his or her membership interests in a mutual insurance company or a mutual affiliate company. The bill establishes, for capital gains tax purposes, the date and cost of acquisition of shares acquired by former members as part of the demutualisation process. In relation to a life insurance company, the deemed acquisition cost of shares will be determined by reference to the embedded value of the company. For general insurance companies, the deemed acquisition cost of shares will be determined by reference to the net tangible assets of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No capital loss will be available in relation to the disposal of demutualisation shares and interests prior to the listing of ordinary shares in the demutualised entity. After listing, the deemed cost of acquisition of the shares will be the lesser of the amount calculated by reference to the embedded value or net tangible assets of the company and the last published price at which the demutualisation shares were traded on their first day of trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new provisions substantially relate to the application of the capital gains and losses provisions. However, parallel provisions have been included for transactions which would otherwise lead to amounts being included in the assessable income of a taxpayer. The amendments will apply to only demutualisations of mutual companies that were in existence at 7.30 p.m. AEST on 9 May 1995. The nature of the measure is such that the cost to revenue cannot be reliably estimated. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 29 November 1994, the Treasurer and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) announced that a form of taxation write-off would be extended to expenditure on new horticultural plantations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is notable that the government has taken over five months to produce these bills, which together are some 200 pages of amendments to our tax system, adding to the continued increase in the complexity and the size of taxation law in Australia. In seeking to have these bills debated as quickly as the government is doing now, after taking five months to bring them to this place, there will no doubt be some defects in the legislation which may surface. It is notable that the government already intends to move amendments to its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most controversial aspects of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) relate to a series of provisions&mdash;firstly, the transitional provisions for the denial of research and development concessions for private tax exempt syndicates; secondly, the denial of franking rebates for transfer pricing adjustments; thirdly, measures to prevent trafficking in trust losses; fourthly, the write-off of capital expenditure on horticultural plantations; fifthly, certain aspects of the dividend imputation rules; and, finally, the retrospective nature of the imposition of capital gains tax on taxable Australian assets of non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills, on our reading and understanding, create a series of anomalies that ought to be addressed. We will seek to remedy these anomalies by amendments which will be moved at the consideration in detail stage. Rather than deal with all the provisions in the bill, I wish to take the time of the House to just deal with some of the more important provisions which we have concerns about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first relates to non-residents and taxable Australian assets. The capital gains tax will apply to gains realised by non-residents on the disposal of taxable Australian assets used solely to produce franked dividends or income subject to withholding tax. The bill inserts proposed new section 160Z(10) to exclude income subject to withholding tax from the capital gains tax exemption under sections 160Z(6) and (9)(a). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure is said to simplify and clarify the operation of the existing law and to ensure that the capital gains tax provisions apply as originally intended. The bill, therefore, is intended to overcome the view that assets used in a permanent establishment in Australia to produce income that is subject to withholding tax are exempt from the capital gains tax provisions pursuant to sections 160Z(6) and (9)(a). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that this interpretation is contrary to the clear intention of parliament as reflected in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of the definition of disposal of taxable Australian assets in section 160T. The amendment applies to disposals of taxable Australian assets on or after 20 September 1985. But where a private binding ruling has been issued in relation to the transaction entered into prior to 9 May when the measure was announced, the terms of the ruling prevailed. When capital gains tax was introduced in 1985, the policy was to tax realised gains on taxable Australian assets. There is an argument that taxable Australian assets used to produce exempt income should be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition generally opposes retrospective tax legislation. There are technical arguments for and against the changes which are sought to be made by the government. Some commentators have said that it is unacceptable to claim that section 160T in some way shows a clear intention to override the clear exemption afforded by section 160Z(6) as section 160T defines what is disposal of a taxable Australian asset. Others have argued that if the tax office wants to attack transactions prior to when the measure was announced&mdash;that is, 9 May&mdash;then the matter should be decided in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is open to the government to change the law, the government ought to be open and honest about why it makes changes. Using the argument that a situation is clearly contrary to the original intention of parliament to justify retrospectivity, as it does in this case, is not satisfactory. Accordingly, the coalition will be seeking to move amendments in the consideration in detail stage which deal with this problem and overcome the anomaly I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area in which we have some concerns is in relation to the provisions concerning dividend imputation. The bill makes a number of amendments to the dividend imputation provisions of part IIIA as a result of the change in the company tax rate taking effect from the 1995-96 income year. Companies will be required to establish a class C franking account and to record franking credits and debits and distribute imputation credits to shareholders by reference to tax paid at 36 per cent. The value of class A, 39 per cent, and class B, 33 per cent, franking account balances will be preserved by converting them to the equivalent class C franking account balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During their 1995-96 franking year, companies will establish a class C franking account and post class C franking credits and debits to the account. The class C franking account represents company tax paid at 36 per cent. Companies other than life insurance companies will convert their existing class A and B franking account balances to class C franking account at some stage during their 1995-96 year. Therefore, most companies will have only a single franking account. Life insurance companies will retain their class A franking account but will convert their class B franking account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies will be required to convert to class C franking account at the earlier of the time when the first class C franking credit of the company arises or the end of the 1995-96 franking year. A company will still be able to pay class A and B franked dividends although it no longer has class A or B franking accounts. No advantage can arise to a company or shareholder as a result of paying class A or B franked dividends. After a company converts to class C, it can still receive class A or B franked dividends. Class C franking deficit tax and deficit deferral tax will be calculated in the same way as class A and B franking deficit tax and deficit deferral tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also amendments which seek to correct defects in sections 160AQZA and 160AR as they apply to life insurance companies with the result that mutual life insurance companies will be entitled to franking rebates for franked dividends received through trusts or partnerships, and mutual life companies will not be entitled to deductions for the imputation credits attached to franked dividends received through trusts or partnerships if franking rebates are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Amendment Bill make consequential amendments to the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Act and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Act to impose class C franking deficit tax and class C deficit deferral tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The class C franking account amendments apply from 1 July 1995. The amendments to correct defects in life insurance company provisions commence from the time the defects first arose.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have concerns in relation to one particular issue; namely, the denial of deduction for franking rebates received by a life insurance company via a trust. It appears that the amendment applies retrospectively. Indeed, LIFA have argued that any shareholder life companies which correctly claimed a deduction on a correct interpretation of the law as written should not now, five years later, be forced to refund the tax applicable to the deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the time of the House to refer more specifically to the objections that have been raised in relation to this provision. As I said, the Life Investment and Superannuation Association of Australia Inc. has made objections about this. The matter has also been raised by legal firms acting on behalf of companies which would be subject, in an adverse way, to this provision. Their memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As from 7 December 1990 the plain wording of the ITAA entitled an ordinary (ie non-mutual) life insurance company to the section 160AR deduction. And there is no indication in any Bill, Act, Explanatory Memorandum, Second Reading Speech, published ruling, determination or other public statement by the ATO, or other extrinsic material suggesting that the intention of the Parliament, the Government or the ATO was that a life insurance company could not claim that deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A life insurance company is under a statutory fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of its policy holders. And it may have been in breach of that duty if it failed to claim a deduction to which it was entitled under the plain wording of the ITAA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reliance on that plain wording:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.At least one life insurance company . . . claimed the deduction and also acted to its detriment by crediting the after tax earnings (including the tax saved) to its 250,000 superannuation policies on a daily basis since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Therefore, neither the Company nor its shareholders benefited from the tax saving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.If the amendments are retrospective, the Company will not be able to recoup any retrospective tax or penalties from its 250,000 policy holders. Therefore, the Company will have to pay the whole of the aggregate amount from its own resources and those of its shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA>The memorandum goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO has known about the deduction claims since at least the end of 1994. And yet neither the ATO nor the Government gave any indication prior to 28 September 1995 that the deduction was not intended to be available.</PARA>
<PARA>In so far as the failure may have given rise to a perceived defect in the legislation, the responsibility for it surely rests with the Australian tax office and the government, not the companies that have been caught by this changed interpretation of the law. Secondly, having regard to the plain wording of the legislation, a taxpayer cannot be presumed to know what parliament, let alone the government or the Australian tax office, intended in the absence of any written indication of that intention prior to the tabling of this bill on 28 September 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of equal importance is the fact that the Australian tax office has known about the claiming of the deduction since at least late 1994, yet there has been no tax office or government announcement since then foreshadowing any legislative amendment at all. Hence, this company&mdash;there may well be other companies in this situation&mdash;has continued to act to its detriment since then in the genuine belief that in doing so it was doing no more than complying with the fiduciary duty to its shareholders imposed on it by the Commonwealth Life Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the complexity of tax law in Australia&mdash;you may recall that in speaking to the general provisions here I referred to amendments to make changes in section 160AQZA, let alone going into numerals, Roman numerals and (a)s and (b)s, which you can go down to&mdash;you have a company, with all the best legal advice in the world, reliant upon that legal advice, acting in a way in which it understands to be a correct interpretation of the Australian taxation law. There has not been one whisper from the government or the tax office or anybody else that the company's interpretation is somehow wrong. In making that interpretation the company has passed on the benefits&mdash;it has not kept them&mdash;to a quarter of a million policyholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we have the government come in here and say, `We don't agree that was the interpretation of the legislation. We're just going to turn it around now.' In effect, the government is saying, `We don't give a damn about the consequences for the company, for any understanding of correct interpretation of the legislation or, for that matter, for those persons to whom this benefit has been passed on.' If there is an example of retrospectivity at work, then clearly this is it. It ought not be accepted by the parliament and it ought not be accepted by the people of Australia. The amendment which we propose to move in relation to this matter ought to be adopted by the government out of a sense of fairness, which it runs around the country telling people it is in favour of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect in relation to the franking dividend imputation is the denial of franking credits where a life company holds shares indirectly through a partnership or trust in a statutory fund that has as its income wholly or partially exempt income. Again, the Life Investment and Superannuation Association of Australia has raised concerns in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the deficiency concerned the denial of full franking rebates in circumstances where a life company holds shares indirectly through a partnership or trust in a statutory fund that has its income wholly or partially exempt from tax. An amendment is required to ensure that the policy embodied in subsection 160AQU(2) is given effect to in section 160AQZA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is required is an amendment which provides that for the purposes of calculating the rebate of tax, to which a taxpayer is entitled under section 160AQZA, the definitions of potential rebate amount and trust amount should be interpreted for the purposes of section 160AQZA by disregarding sections such as 110C, 112A, 116FB and so on. Again, there are problems in relation to this particular section which we believe the government ought to address. The government should not leave these anomalies simply hanging in the wind, as it does as a consequence of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area that we have concerns about relates to franking credits and international profit misallocation. The bill amends part IIIA to provide that no franking credits arise under the imputation system for tax paid by companies where a payment of tax is made in relation to profits which have been misallocated offshore through transfer pricing or non-arms-length dealings. The amendments will apply to original amended assessments which issue after the budget announcement on 9 May 1995, irrespective of the income year to which the misallocation of profit adjustments arises. Again, concerns have been raised by a number of bodies in relation to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Institute of Chartered Accountants has argued that the provision will damage Australia's export earnings. It makes the point that there is little agreement between the Australian Taxation Office and tax advisers on transfer pricing, which is the dominant issue in international trade. A recent media release from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in which they address this issue states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Director at the Institute, Ian Langford-Brown, said the decision denying franking credits for tax paid by companies on transfer pricing adjustments, which was announced in the Budget, would damage Australia's export earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Considering there is little agreement between the Tax Office and tax advisers on this contentious problem, which is the dominant issue in international trade, the changes the Government has made are unbelievable," Mr Langford-Brown said.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to explain his contention. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Taxpayers are facing loaded dice on this issue, especially as the National Tax Liaison Group is still far from agreement on such fundamentals as methodologies, comparatives, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Langford-Brown said the new rules on transfer pricing were at odds with the principle that the level of penalties directly relates to whether the adjustment arose from a deliberate act or an inadvertent error.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Auditors and company directors now face further uncertainties in forming a view on a company's accounts and businesses face further confusion over how the change will be implemented by the Tax Office.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter was also raised by the Corporate Tax Association. It says that the proposal will impact unfairly in many cases, especially for Australian multinationals. The new legislation seeks to trace the relevant profits but it can be seen for an Australian group that any profits misallocated would still remain within the group for later distribution and there can be no justification for the denial of the franking credits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have concerns in relation to the provisions relating to research and development. Research and development syndicates have been a mechanism for funding research and development by companies requiring taxation shelter. Generally these companies would not spend money on research and development in the absence of the deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, companies which wish to conduct research and development need funds and cannot make use of a tax deduction. A significant source of these projects has come from private and public tax exempt companies. The amendments are aimed at ensuring that consistent tax treatment is afforded to expenditure, as is the case with expenditure incurred by public tax exempt entities under section 73CB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments apply to expenditure incurred after 7.30 p.m. on 9 May when the measure was announced. The transitional rules are slightly more generous than the original transitional rules announced on 9 May. However, in 1992 the government moved to deny a deduction for research and development to syndicates involving public sector tax exempt bodies by the insertion of section 73CB into the act. A Senate amendment introduced a transitional measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of allegations have been made by private sector tax exempt researchers who do not fall within the transitional arrangements as applications were lodged prior to 9 May but had not been considered by the Research and Development Board. For example, one researcher alleges that they were led by AusIndustry to believe that their submissions would be considered at the board meeting in June. Another alleges that AusIndustry officials advised all the major syndicate arrangers during the lead-up to the May meeting that private tax exempt syndicates would not be considered at the May meeting but the deferral would not affect their right to consideration at a later meeting. Other private tax exempt applications were considered at the May meeting and improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one of the submissions is from the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. If there were a worthy research institute in Australia that ought to be treated with equality by the government in the way in which it treats such funds, I could not think of one better deserving of that than the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. But the institute points out that the effect of this bill is that, even though it submitted a research and development syndicate application on 3 May 1995 in accordance with the legislation existing before 9 May 1995, it would not be considered. The institute goes on to point out the unfairness of that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other submissions which relate to this matter, some of which I cannot name because of aspects of commercial confidentiality that arise. But they clearly indicate, as I have indicated in general terms, that companies were given an assurance&mdash;that is, provided that their application had been lodged before the date, even with the application having not been considered, that any subsequent consideration of it would bring them within the provisions. Now we have legislation which indicates that that is not the case. For those reasons, we will be moving amendments to allow the old provisions to continue to apply to those applications which were lodged prior to the budget announcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other matters in this bill which I will just briefly touch upon, as time is expiring. The provision relating to the sales tax exemption for rice milk reflects matters which were raised in a private member's bill by Senator Watson earlier this year. For that reason, we are delighted that the government has picked that provision up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there are some provisions which relate to horticulture which I just wish to touch on very briefly. These are the tax write-off provisions for new horticulture plantations. The bill inserts division 10F to implement the budget announcement concerning new horticultural plantations to allow for the write-off of the original capital expenditure incurred in establishing horticultural plants used in the business of primary production. The provisions apply to each horticultural plant. To claim a write-off, the taxpayer must own the plants and use the plants to produce assessable income from a business of horticulture. Lessees and licensees who carry on the business of horticulture will be entitled to the deduction in preference to the lessor or licenser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments apply to expenditure incurred after 9 May in establishing horticultural plants. It is interesting that the bill implements the government's belated response to the 2000 horticultural task force which recommended in February 1994 that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Industry Commission recommendation that the taxation treatment of expenditure on all new horticultural plantations be revised to provide a more neutral treatment compared with expenditure on other activities. All new horticultural plantings should be treated consistently with the recent government amendments to the ITAA to allow the costs of acquisition and planting of grapevines to be written off over four years from the time of planting.</PARA>
<PARA>The task force was essentially an industry working group, but it was headed by Senator Sherry. On 29 November the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and Senator Bob Collins announced that the government had agreed to the extension of a taxation write-off for expenditure on all new horticultural plantations. The taxation treatment being offered to horticultural plantations is substantially different from that being offered for the cost of establishing grapevines, announced in the 1993 budget as part of the package including sales tax increases. Therefore, some sectors of the horticultural industry have expressed disappointment with the government's proposal and seek the same taxation treatment as that given to grapevines. The wine growers industry, for example, also favours consistent treatment being offered to horticultural plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems that arise out of the different way in which the treatment applies to horticulture as it does to grapes, some of which are of a technical nature which time precludes me at present from going into. I can say though that, as far as the coalition is concerned, the recommendations of the Industry Commission are those which we support and, in government, are matters which we would attend to. We are disappointed that they have not been dealt with either in a timely manner or effectively by this government in this particular bill when it had the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, there are many other matters in this complex and complicated piece of taxation legislation arising from this year's budget announcements which time precludes me from addressing. Suffice it to say that we will not be opposing the bill as a whole or those various other measures. But we do have concerns about three matters in particular which I have raised, and in the committee stage of this bill we will be moving amendments accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on the bills which are before the House tonight. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995, as outlined in the second reading speech by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), is a package of innovative measures designed to contribute to the overriding principal objective of the 1995-96 budget&mdash;that is, to provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The raft of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which stem from the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) covers a very wide range of issues that have already been covered here today. To this end, I will concentrate on just a few of the key amendments in order to highlight the contribution they will make to this government's budget objective of economic expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this government's economic management record since its election in 1983 is second to none. Indeed, the government over the past 12 1/2 years has transformed this nation's economy from a non-competitive and insular backwater into one that is highly competitive and fully integrated into the global economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia over the past two years has seen a remarkable economic recovery take place in the wake of a worldwide recession in the early 1990s, thanks to this government's responsible economic management. The economy, after surging in 1994 with a growth rate of five per cent, is now at a more sustainable level approaching 3.75 per cent. Complementing these sustainable growth figures, the underlying inflation rate remains at about 2.5 per cent and employment growth continues apace, with tens of thousands of jobs being created on a monthly basis under the Working Nation employment strategy. As a result, interest rates, while stable at the moment, are being predicted to fall, thus providing a further boost to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of unemployment or, more specifically, employment and the role that Working Nation is playing there, I would put on record my thanks for the contribution that many people are making in our communities right throughout Australia, particularly some in my own electorate, in ensuring the success of Working Nation. We make all those decisions here, and rightly so. But they must filter down through the community to be assured of success there. The area consultative committee in my electorate has played a vital role in the success of the Working Nation initiatives there. I thank all those who are participating on that committee for its success and the way that success is flowing on to our local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment and profitability have been buoyant, with investment expenditure outstripping budget forecasts and retail turnover figures for 1995-96 being over and above the impressive 7.5 per cent increase of 1994-95 thus far. There is a lot of good news about economic growth and prosperity in Australia at the current time. It is something that I believe should be focused on a lot more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can deny that particular growth, despite the efforts of the chicken littles on the opposition front bench&mdash;that is, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;who are more intent on scaremongering than on getting behind and promoting Australian economic growth and prosperity. That is what we need to do to ensure the confidence necessary out in our community for business to expand&mdash;and that is, of course, where the jobs are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the figures indicate that the economy is growing apace, the government recognises that there is still much work to be done in maintaining our growth rate and increasing employment growth and national living standards. The budget this year, delivered by the Treasurer (Mr Willis), certainly recognised this point and, in response, has put in place a legislative framework to increase public savings and private savings to ensure long-term economic growth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995 forms a key component of the government's strategy to tighten fiscal policy and deliver on our budget commitment to reduce the federal government's call on private savings and, in so doing, increase the budget surplus from $718 million in 1995-96 to approximately $7.4 billion or 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1998-99.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revenue measures that the government is putting in place through the taxation amendment bills, including the one before the House today, will strengthen the Commonwealth's tax base, which has been in decline as a share of GDP since 1987-88, by adding an estimated $2.4 billion to revenue in 1995-96 and $3.6 billion in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the tightening and removing of anomalies to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as part of this strategy, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1995 will put in place key technical changes relating to the levelling of capital gains tax, dividend imputations and franking credits to this effect. In relation to part IIIAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, this amendment bill will ensure that franking credits in certain circumstances cannot be used to largely negate the additional company tax payable as a result of an adjustment to reflect arms-length dealings where profits have been shifted or misallocated offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, the proposed amendment will provide that no franking credits arise when a payment of tax is made in relation to a misallocation of profit adjustment. Similarly, if a misallocation of profit is subsequently reduced upon appeal, objection or review, a franking credit will not arise upon the issue of an amended assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As such, the potential to deliberately avoid paying company tax or inadvertently avoid paying company tax on these types of transactions will be negated, with only a slight increase in compliance costs to those companies which have already misallocated or shifted profits offshore. Consequently, the estimated gains to revenue from this measure are $3 million in 1994-95, $21 million in 1995-96 and $25 million in subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the amendment dealing with franking credits, the changes to the dividend imputation provisions under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will also correct franking related problems primarily associated with mutual and non-mutual life insurance companies. On the subject of dividend imputation, I must say that this was another initiative of this government. We assisted to expand industry and give it more opportunities to take advantage of such incentives. It is one of the many things that this government has helped to progress with the many reforms we have undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the amendment puts in place the legislative framework requiring companies to establish a class C franking account recording franking credits and debits and the distribution of imputation credits to shareholders. That follows the increase in the company tax rate from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. The government, in increasing the company tax rate to 36 per cent, thought it appropriate that the corporate sector&mdash;whose profit share has returned to the record levels of the 1980s&mdash;make a contribution to the tightening of fiscal policy, thus benefiting all Australians in the long term. Of course, that is very much to the heart of the equity question underpinning this government's taxation reforms. To this end, the increase in the company tax rate will add an extra $320 million to revenue in 1995-96 and an estimated $1.57 billion in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the operation of the capital gains tax provisions under division 19A of part IIIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, this bill seeks to make a number of amendments, the chief purpose being to reduce compliance costs on corporate tax payers and ensure that division 19A is not a disincentive to corporate restructuring. As members of the House will recall, division 19A operates to prevent timing advantages that could arise when assets are transferred and values are shifted between shares and loans in commonly owned transferor and transferee companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, the major amendments to the act will include: the introduction of anti-avoidance measures so that cost base adjustments will be made to shares or loans in a company in respect of newly created assets which are vested in a related company; simplifying the tests used to determine whether a value shift has occurred when an asset that was acquired by a commonly owned company, before it came to be under common ownership with the transferee company, is transferred to another group or company; the insertion of new rules to be applied in determining when a value shift will be taken to have occurred as a consequence of the transfer of a depreciable asset between commonly owned companies; and the modification and extension of the current tests used to determine whether a value shift has occurred, recognising situations where interests in the transferor are held by more than one member of the company group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments I have just outlined from the bill before the House today&mdash;besides contributing to the government's strategy to promote economic growth through a fiscal tightening&mdash;highlight the simple fact that, since we came to government in 1983, we have built a much more effective, efficient and fairer taxation system by a long shot than we had under the previous coalition government. Indeed, this government in 1983 inherited a ramshackle tax system which was riddled with loopholes that defied description. You could have driven the proverbial semitrailer through the legislation and not have been caught if you were not paying your fair share of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our tax system at that point was the laughing stock of the Western world. In that context, the honourable member for Bennelong, as Treasurer, basically condoned a system where paying tax was optional for the wealthiest people in this country. It was optional: you could have decided whether you wanted to pay tax or not, and you do not need any guesses to work out which course someone like that would take. As was pointed out by the royal commissioner, the bottom-of-the-harbour rorts under the Fraser government saw the fastest growing industry in Australia at the time, being the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>

You would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that reforms have taken place and that we are taking on other measures for reform.

Measures are being taken up in that program to ensure continuing reforms in the taxation area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be polite, the tax system under the stewardship of the Leader of the Opposition was an absolute disgrace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Capital gains tax is an issue in this particular bill. I was just highlighting the reforms that have effectively broadened the tax base. They cover a lot of issues such as dividend imputations, as I mentioned before, and franking credits. They are important issues certainly to members on this side of the House but obviously not to Liberals, Nationals or newborn Independents on the other side. The pathetic and scurrilous campaign that the opposition ran against the government's capital gains tax reforms, for instance, is a case in point. Fortunately, their campaign was to no avail and the capital gains tax has operated since the mid-1980s as part of a fair and equitable taxation system. It is fair and equitable taxation systems that we have been trying to pursue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has done more than just lower personal taxes. We have also lowered company tax. Even with the latest rise to 36 per cent, the company tax under this government is 10 per cent lower than when those opposite were last occupying the treasury bench. Furthermore, since this Labor government came to office in 1983, it has put in place a host of tax incentives for Australian businesses which have given them the opportunity to compete effectively in world markets. A lot of those incentives and further enhancements to them are covered in these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These incentives include the 150 per cent deduction for research and development; concessions to assist investment in small business; a 10 per cent development allowance for large scale projects with plant and equipment investment of $50 million or more; 15-year tax concessions for infrastructure borrowings; accelerated depreciation on assets with long, effective lives; and increased write-off allowances for hotels and factories. These initiatives will be further complemented by the key amendments which form part of the bill before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, proposed amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will give horticultural plantations and perennial crops comparable tax treatment to other industries by allowing for the write-off of the original capital expenditure incurred in establishing horticultural plants used in a business of primary production. This amendment flows from a report from the Industry Commission in May 1993 which concluded that taxation treatment of horticultural plantations was anomalous and discriminates against investment in perennial crops relative to annual crops. In a similar vein, amendments pertaining to the introduction of a sales tax exemption for rice milk&mdash;this was referred to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews)&mdash;have also been proposed in the bill before the House today. In this context, the proposed amendments will ensure that rice milk is treated for sales tax purposes the same as other similar milk products, such as soy milk beverages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these tax incentive initiatives, the already favourable environment for business in Australia will become even better if we encourage superannuation funds to invest in smaller and more innovative companies in this country. Superannuation funds should take up the challenge of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday. He talked in question time about the need for superannuation funds to lend to small and medium sized businesses. He made particular reference to a company which had to go offshore to borrow when it should have been able to borrow here in Australia. So the challenge is there for the superannuation funds, and they need to take that up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether there should be more tax incentives for the superannuation funds remains to be seen, but there is certainly a need for them to take up that opportunity and run with it in the interests of this nation. They should not be forcing businesses to go offshore or, in a lot of cases, to go out of business because they cannot borrow effectively in Australia. There have been many Australian innovations which have failed, gone offshore or never developed because of a lack of capital or flexible borrowing arrangements to assist the project to get off the ground. So the challenge is there for the superannuation funds in Australia, and they should pick up the ball and run with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lending institutions to date have not been prepared to provide the flexible borrowing arrangements required for new and innovative companies to expand and develop new markets. The superannuation funds, with their vast capital investment pools which will only continue to grow in size under the government's superannuation policies, are in the prime position to facilitate the development of industry, particularly small and medium sized businesses. The investment of just one per cent of the superannuation savings pool would provide something like $1.5 billion to industry development. Imagine the benefits if they took that a little further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this Labor government has done a great deal to reform the nation's tax system. The system now is more efficient, equitable and progressive than it was in 1983. The opposition, however, for some perverse ideological reasons is still keen to introduce a regressive goods and services tax. The honourable member for Menzies alluded to this issue only last week. He suggested that that was the path to take, even though it may take until the year 2020. Perhaps that is an indication of his acceptance that they will be in opposition until at least 2020&mdash;and they will be if he keeps trotting out a goods and services tax as part of the tax debate in this nation. Instead, he should support the initiatives that this government has been putting forward which are reforming the tax system in this country and making it a more fair and equitable tax system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Amendment Bill were introduced into the House of Representatives on 28 September 1995. It is worth noting that all but one of the measures contained in these cognate bills were announced in the budget of 9 May 1995. It is also worth noting that that was 3 1/2 months before the bills were introduced into this chamber and some 4 1/2 months before the parliament began consideration prior to passing a bill in amended form. In those circumstances, it is good to see that the government has finally thought it appropriate to bring the proposed legislation before the parliament so that the full detail of the measures can be seen and so that we will finally get to talk about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends three principal acts: the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1993. The bill is written in the new style adopted as part of the tax law improvement project which is conveniently known as TLIP&mdash;it is almost `tulip'. It is supposed to use a simpler form of language and the numbering system is different. The stated aim is to have a simpler law which is easier to comply with. I believe the bill fails on this count. It fails to meet the objectives of the TLIP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills deal with 11 different matters and amount to a total of 205 pages of amendments. Schedule 7 alone, which deals with trust losses, amounts to 55 pages. It is therefore little wonder that the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is considered by anyone who has had the opportunity to have a look at it to be extremely complex. But why should these amendments be so paper consuming and complex? The answer is the policy which underlines the legislation. As the Australian Taxation Institute has stated, this legislation applies differing rules depending on the category of trust being dealt with. This is contrasted with sections 80A to 80E, under which loss recoupment rules are applied to companies and which are relatively simple to understand and to comply with. The institute has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason, it is submitted that the cost of compliance with these new rules will far exceed those in relation to the company loss provisions and for this reason alone, the TIA is critical of their present format.</PARA>
<PARA>The government pays lip-service to reducing the cost of compliance but, because it is unable to get its policy framework in good order, the end result is invariably further increases in compliance costs. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) deals with capital gains tax amendments relating to value shifting and other general amendments, dividend imputation, franking credits and international profit misallocation, demutualisation of insurance companies, and establishment costs of horticultural plants. It also proposes changes to the tax treatment of forestry plantations, research and development, sales tax exemption for rice milk, trust losses, and non-compulsory uniforms or wardrobes. I propose to deal with only some of these matters because of limited speaking time, although I hope to comment on others when the bills are considered in the consideration in detail stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has circulated amendments to this bill before we have even deliberated on it. So the comments I make relate to the bill as it was first introduced. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said in his second reading speech that a supplementary explanatory memorandum was available with the proposed amendments. I simply record that it was not available, but I also acknowledge with gratitude that the Assistant Treasurer obtained a copy for me because I made it known to him at the time that he was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 1 of schedule 7 inserts a new schedule 2C into the Income Tax Assessment Act to provide new rules that have to be satisfied by trusts before prior and current year losses can be deducted. The proposed rules, with the exception of an income injection test, will not apply to family trusts. The rules that will apply, other than the income injection test, will depend on the type of trust being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill distinguishes between three basic types of trusts: fixed trusts, including widely held unit trusts; non-fixed trusts; and excepted trusts. The new regime will contain an income injection test which applies to deny a deduction to the trust for losses. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In broad terms, the test will apply where, in connection with a scheme, the losses are used to shelter assessable income from tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several problems have been highlighted by the Australian Taxation Institute and the Australian Society of Chartered Practising Accountants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `continuity of business test' differentiates between the rules relating to companies and those for trusts. The differentiation places fixed trusts at a tax disadvantage compared with companies, and I have already touched on that. These new rules will restrict the circumstances in which current and prior year losses can be deducted. On 6 October, Mr Terry Rooney of the ASCPA said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rules regarding the utilisation of losses generated by trusts are especially harsh and represent the greatest change to the taxation of trusts in the past 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the budget, the Treasurer announced that he intended to stop the leakage of revenue through trafficking in trust losses, but in typical government over zealousness the changes go too far and will dry up the economic reservoir for many businesses.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems the government's attitude to trusts is that they are created only to avoid and/or reduce tax obligations. The fact is that tax is only one factor in the creation of trusts. With the income injection test, the proposed rules are overly prescriptive, making the law more complex than it need be and also failing to take into account circumstances other than those catered for in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these instances, such as the `different amount of assessable income' and the definition of the concept of `benefit', it would have been better if the government had used some sort of anti-avoidance clause. Such a clause would ensure that the intent of the legislation&mdash;that is, the targeting of trafficking in trust losses and therefore tax avoidance&mdash;is actually achieved without hindering trusts which are not engaged in avoiding tax obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have also been raised about the definition of the family trust. Naturally, existing family trusts would not want to be reclassified as a non-fixed trust and thereby have to meet all four tests to be applied. This is something which should be examined to ensure that legitimate family trusts are not deprived of their status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As to franking credits and international profit misallocation, this bill, as claimed in the explanatory memorandum:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will provide that no franking credits arise where a payment of tax is made in relation to a misallocation of profit adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, where a misallocation of profit adjustment is subsequently reduced (eg. upon objection, review, or appeal), a franking debit will not arise upon the issue of an amended assessment where the payment of tax for the original misallocation of profit adjustment did not give rise to a franking credit.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a measure which the Corporate Tax Association and tax practitioners generally have raised serious concerns about. It is opposed by them because it is seen as being too harsh. As well as there being the proposals in this bill, the Australian Taxation Office has issued two tax rulings, TR94/14 and TR95/D11, which, together, are almost 200 pages. These rulings, along with other advice from the ATO, comprise about 300 pages with apparently more to come. So much for simplification of tax laws generally and reducing the cost of compliance with those laws in particular. The situation is hardly making it easier to interpret law.

This will bring the amount of tax payable to $972,840. This increases the effective tax paid on the shares in the example from 48.4 per cent to 65.43 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the Australian Taxation Office's policy and approach generally is that there is no reasonableness test. Their interpretation of the law is clearly aimed at maximising revenue to the detriment of applying the law in the way originally intended. The ATO maintains that, where a taxpayer calculates the amount of tax payable in a different way from the ATO, the ATO is entitled to impose penalties. This is compounded by this bill should an unintentional underpayment of tax occur, because not only will the taxpayer be subject to penalties but the amount of tax paid will not give rise to imputation credits when calculating the credits for company tax paid upon a dividend being declared by a taxpayer company. The proposed changes are unfair and will no doubt lead to increased litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this probable development is obvious: taxpayers are less likely to accept such patently unfair rulings. After all, tax rulings are not law but simply a guide as to how the ATO interprets the law. The ATO can and does make mistakes, as we and taxpayers know only too well. This has been borne out by several legal cases where tax rulings have been challenged and struck down by the courts. The measures in this bill and the tax rulings as well need to be reassessed so as not to introduce patently unfair practices into the tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments contained in part 2 of schedule 4 relate to forestry plantations. This amendment will ensure that, where a taxpayer who conducts timber operations purchases an established forest or plantation before the trees are felled, the taxpayer pays tax on only the net proceeds from the sale of the trees. I endorse this amendment, and I make it clear that I strongly support measures to encourage the move towards forestry plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the most obvious solution to the current problems of woodchipping native forest is to harvest new-growth plantation forests. This will reduce the need to harvest old-growth forests, in which so much of our treasured flora and fauna exist. This particular amendment will supplement the objective set out in the national forest policy statement of 1992, which has been signed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and all premiers and chief ministers. Article 4.5 in that statement asserts that all Australian governments will continue to encourage plantations. The third paragraph of article 4.5 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve the government's objectives it will be necessary to ensure the impediments to plantation development are minimal in areas such as taxation, planning and access to information.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's response to this admirable objective so far has been mixed. Unfortunately, the good intentions are there, yet in terms of tax policy the ATO has tended to make a bit of a mess of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem relates to the management of tax rulings by the Australian Taxation Office. As I mentioned in this place I think on 1 March of this year, the Australian Taxation Office now refuses to provide private tax rulings for afforestation projects. I understand that the reason for the ATO not issuing a private ruling is that they refuse to provide these in relation to primary industry production projects as a curious matter of course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is harebrained action such as that which has the potential to cripple moves towards plantation and renewable sources of timber. Companies developing plantations need to know with some certainty how they will be taxed on future earnings. The only positive development in this area is that the ATO has finally completed its review of tax ruling IT360 and replaced it in May with the new ruling TR95/6. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More can be done by the government, however, to encourage plantation developments. I draw the House's attention to the excellent coalition policy paper entitled `Degradation in Australia', which was launched by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) earlier this year. Within this document is a commitment to the reafforestation of 15 per cent of Australia's cleared land, with incentives to be provided to landowners to reach that objective. This will no doubt include tax concessions for seeds and seedlings, fencing and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With newly reafforested land there should be plenty of scope for plantations. The problems we have in terms of forestry policy are that we have a government which sends out mixed signals and we have some extremists in the environmentalist camp who are totally opposed to the woodchipping of any forests, including plantations. It is through the development of plantations on currently cleared land that we can begin to rectify many land degradation problems such as salinity and erosion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plantations also provide an economically sustainable method of doing our bit to reverse the greenhouse effect. We need a unified policy approach and the right incentives. To this end, we should re-examine the method by which plantation income is treated for tax purposes. One suggested way of accounting for the expenses and revenue of plantation forests would be to deduct the total of real expenses from revenue at the time of the sale of the timber which generates the taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems for the plantation industry is that it incurs a great deal of expense over many years prior to being able to harvest the timber. This results in massive taxable income in the financial years when harvesting occurs. It might be better for all expenses relating to a plantation to be maintained in real terms and deducted in the year in which the income is received. I emphasise that this is only one suggestion about how the tax treatment of plantations might evolve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plantations Australia&mdash;that is the industry organisation&mdash;has mentioned five additional measures for reforming the tax system to encourage plantation development. The objective is simple: we need a tax regime for plantations which not only encourages investment but also avoids the creation of artificial tax havens. Incentives should be offered only where the industry is stagnating. Eliminating taxation problems, however, should be sufficient to encourage plantation forests. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The government has consistently added to the tax regime and to the complexity of taxation and, despite the process of claim simplification, increased complexity in tax law.

It is a dreadful story. It is one where the Prime Minister has failed dismally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look back at the tax burden for Australian workers 10 years ago as compared with today. Approximately 10 years ago the Prime Minister unveiled his tax reform package. The purposes of that tax reform package were to slash marginal tax rates and to restore fairness to the tax system. It has done nothing in that regard. Middle income earners are paying far more. It is an absolute fact that the cost to the Australian taxpayer and to the average Australian worker under this government has been horrific. Australians are also paying more in indirect taxes than they were 10 years ago. So there is no doubt that a report from Access Economics which shows how workers have suffered under this government is accepted by the community as being factual. The only group that will not accept that report is the government itself. </PARA>

But, if you add the superannuation guarantee charge, as one must&mdash;it is a tax that must be paid&mdash;you find that people are now paying a lot more in taxation than they were 10 years ago. The government acts with sophistry about its tax cuts or tax charges. It feels no regret and has no problem at all in saying, `You won't get a tax cut. We'll shift it into a superannuation charge,' and that this is going to be in the year 2020 or something or other. </PARA>

The reforms, which were 10 years old on 19 September this year, ushered in by Mr Keating when he was Treasurer&mdash;the capital gains taxes, the fringe benefits tax, a broader sales tax, dividend imputation and the first of a series of cuts to personal income tax&mdash;have all amounted to no gain for the average Australian worker.

The complexity of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is such that it is 194 pages long. That is a modest bill. We get a tax bill that size every two weeks. This parliament adds to tax law at the rate of approximately 200 pages per week that it sits. Isn't that something to be proud of? That is called a simplification process. This simplification process has meant that in personal income tax 2.4 per cent greater of our gross domestic product is gobbled up and absorbed. It is not an octopus that grabs things. It is like a black hole in the galaxy. Things just vanish in there, never to reappear. At the same time, this government is borrowing hand over fist. It is both the greatest taxing and the greatest borrowing government in Australian history. It has the greatest debt of any country. In this budget there is a debt of $9 billion to pay the interest charges on borrowings of the Commonwealth.

The fact is that those on twice average weekly earnings are paying more now than they were before. The ones who are most hit&mdash;the ones who are paying the greatest increase of  their income in increased taxation&mdash;are those on average weekly earnings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) adds to tax law in a myriad of ways. It is almost incomprehensible to take in all the various charges and changes. Accountancy firms tell me that they charge a minimum fee of $5,000 to give advice on the capital gains taxation assessments and tell you whether you are eligible for capital gains tax. These are small shopkeepers who do not know how to make decisions on whether they should buy or sell or what they should do with their small businesses. We have large accounting firms growing fat. The government is putting money in the pockets of lawyers and accountants, but not enough in the pockets of those who are productive and making the tax that you want to charge them and making the profits that are necessary to employ people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capital gains tax in this legislation proposes increases in personal use thresholds and changes to the anti-avoidance rules for assets, amendments to the value shifting rules of division 19A of part IIIA, compulsory roll-over of capital losses on group transfers of assets, exclusion of assets used to produce income subject to withholding tax from the capital gains tax and exemption for assets producing exempt income. There is a nice little mouthful. One can go through the legislation and see the complexity of the changes. It includes changes of dividend imputation charges, tax write-off for capital costs of establishing new horticultural plants, treatment of the sale of immature forestry plantations and transfer responsibility for the maintenance of the register of approved occupational clothing. I do not know how people follow the changes that we make. It also includes demutualisation of insurance companies, measures to prevent trafficking in trust losses and clarification of application of the capital gains tax to taxable Australian assets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined the disastrous record of the Keating government in regard to personal income tax. I have highlighted the fact that when the Keating reforms were unveiled 10 years ago they were heralded as an approach to slashing marginal tax rates. They have done nothing of the sort. Marginal tax rates are lower, but people are paying more personal tax than they were 10 years ago. One has to bear on top of that the sorts of attitudes of the Prime Minister himself because it is very difficult to know exactly what the Prime Minister stands for. On the one hand, he is the one who promised l-a-w law tax cuts but, on the other hand, he broke his promise and increased sales tax at the same time. </PARA>

He said that this was just going to be sacrosanct and it would pay for the medical treatment of Australians for the next 100 years on one per cent or 1.5 per cent, but it would never increase. Does one vote for or support the Prime Minister who said he is not going to increase the Medicare levy but who then did increase it? One does not know where one stands. It depends on whether it is before or after an election. The question that needs to be asked is: which Paul Keating would you vote for?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the promised company tax cuts? They were reduced for a year or two and then they were put back up again.

The facts are proven. Even over a 10-year period, when there should have been a substantial period of test, there is a greater proportion of gross domestic product being collected in personal income tax and the middle income earners of Australia are worse off. They are paying a greater proportion of their income in taxation than they have ever paid before. </PARA>

I cannot understand the Australian Labor Party being so blase in breaking promises of that sort. What about the Prime Minister who promised to reduce the foreign debt? I think that ran for around four or five budgets. We even had a budget which was self-repairing in regard to the foreign debt. I think Mr Dawkins introduced that one.

Can you trust one who 10 years ago said he would reduce the rate of marginal taxation and reduce the amount paid by middle income earners if, 10 years later, you find that you are paying more?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces a new division 10F which is designed to implement the budget announcement concerning new horticultural plantations to allow for the write-off of the original capital expenditure incurred in establishing horticultural plants used in the business of primary production. The provisions apply to each horticultural plant. I applaud the government for bringing this in. As always, I have to be fair dinkum and, if they are doing something that is right or down the track of being right, or an improvement, I have to say so. This is an improvement, although I believe it does not go far enough. I will expand on that. I have to be fair and congratulate the government on seeking to do something better, but there is more to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Horticulture includes the cultivation and propagation of plants, fungi, bulbs, spores and so on, but it does not include the cropping of annual plants or forestry operations. If I have time I will return to this particular definition of horticulture, because it is interesting to see precisely how it is defined in the act. The establishment costs must be capital in nature and not otherwise deductible. The establishment costs do not include the cost of clearing of land or costs that are recouped. Again, if there is time I will expand on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To claim the write-off, the taxpayer must own the plants and use the plants to produce assessable income from a business or horticulture. Lessees and licensees&mdash;because this applies to those who lease land, whether it be crown land or whether they have licences to operate leases elsewhere&mdash;are able to carry on the business of horticulture and will be entitled to the deduction in preference to the lessor or licensor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The write-off begins when the plants are used or held ready for use to produce assessable income. In terms of the bill, this is usually at the beginning of what is expected to be the plant's first commercial season. Herein I believe lies a degree of inequity and injustice. I will expand on this in a moment. The costs are written off over the effective life of the plant and the effective life is measured by its capacity to produce assessable income whilst being used in the business of horticulture. This relates to commercial circumstances rather than botanical possibilities. Of course, the taxpayer can elect to adopt the commissioner's estimates of effective life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The write-off rates are identical to those for plant and equipment. As an example, if there is less than three years of effective life, there is an immediate write-off; if the effective life is five years to less than 6 2/3, there is a 0.27 write-off, with a maximum write-off period of three years and 257 days. In the case of horticultural trees, which have an effective life of 30 years or more, the prime cost rate is 0.07 and the maximum write-off period is 14 years and 105 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a plant happens to be destroyed by drought, fire or something of that nature, a deduction will be available for the balance of the write-off less any recouped amounts such as insurance. The amendments apply to expenditure incurred after 9 May, the date of the budget. This is expenditure incurred after 9 May in establishing horticultural plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we could be much fairer about this, bearing in mind the fact that in many cases horticultural plants have a long lead time before getting to that effective life. It could take five, six or even seven years before you start to get full production from a plant or tree. Therefore, I believe it would be worth while to consider&mdash;I will certainly urge it on the coalition government which will be in power after the next election&mdash;amending this so the concession can apply to expenditure already incurred for plants that are about to commence their effective life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, if this measure came in on 9 May and the plants were to produce their effective life in the coming spring or summer season, I suggest the effective date should be retrospective to the expenditure when they started to come in. Obviously there has to be a limit and you cannot go back forever. In the current financial year the horticulturalists will be taxed on the income produced from plants and trees that are bearing this year for the first time, and they will have no benefit whatsoever from all the capital costs put into the establishment before they become productive. I believe that would be a fair variation to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently there is no write-off available for the capital cost of establishing or acquiring live plants which crop more than once in a plant's life and that is unfair. However, the cost of planting annual crops such as wheat and barley is deductible at the time the expenditure is incurred, because the production cycle is annual and the expenditure on grain for planting is considered recurrent. Accordingly, the government has decided to remove this discrimination and provide appropriate tax relief. Again I say publicly that I applaud it for taking this action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that the Australian Commissioner of Taxation will be issuing a ruling to set out the effective life of different horticultural varieties and individual taxpayers, if they wish, can object to the commissioner's ruling on this. If they can provide the evidence, it may be possible to set a different rate. In actual fact, what this bill is doing is implementing the government's very belated response to the 2000 horticulture task force which as far back as February 1994 recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry Commission recommends that the taxation treatment of expenditure on all new horticultural plantations be revised to provide a more neutral treatment compared with expenditure on other activities.

<PARA>That task force was essentially an industry group but was chaired by Senator Sherry.

I believe, and the coalition believes, that the same provision should be available to other horticultural products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you are talking about horticultural production, what is the real difference between a grape vine and a kiwi fruit vine?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation treatment being offered for horticultural plantations is substantially different from that offered with respect to the cost of establishing grape vines, as announced in the 1993 budget as part of the package which included sales tax increases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The write-off for horticulture does not commence until production commences which, for certain trees that have an extensive effective life, may not be for five or six years. In such circumstances, a write-off is not available until year five or six and the maximum write-off is over 14 years. It will therefore take some 20 years before the cost of some plantations is written off. Again, compare this with the example of the vineyards where things are all fixed and finished in four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deferred write-off of horticultural plantations imposes cashflow burdens. That impacts more heavily on small producers than on large companies. As you would know from personal experience, Mr Deputy Speaker, in my electorate and on the north coast of New South Wales the banana growers, blueberry growers, pawpaw growers and kiwi fruit growers are all small producers. Basically, these are family activities. These people desperately need their cashflow and it would be most beneficial if we were able to change things to give them that benefit. There are also significant compliance cost issues associated with establishing effective lives, especially for audit purposes, given the changes in market requirements and product variation within one fruit type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition support the recommendations of the Industry Commission. We publicly pledge to attend to this matter in government. We will not oppose the bill because, as I said, it is an improvement and goes some way along the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that I would expand on the definition of `horticulture'. I would like to refer to the explanatory memorandum because this matter is significant and people should be aware of what is involved. `Primary production' is defined, for taxation purposes, as being any of several distinct kinds of production. Each of those kinds of production is distinct from any other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Horticulture' is defined in subsection 6(1) in terms which include both the cultivation and propagation of plants, fungi, their seeds, bulbs, spores, and the like. Horticulture is apt to include cultivation for such produce as fruits, flowers, foliage or fruiting bodies. It is apt to include propagation, producing like-growing plants and fungi or their seeds, bulbs and spores. It is commonly distinguished from operations such as grain growing, involving the cropping of annual plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one specific exclusion. Horticulture does not encompass forestry operations which, as defined, broadly include the planting and tending of trees and forests or plantations where the trees are intended for felling, as well as the felling of trees and the transport of trees by the feller to the place where they will be first milled. I pause at this particular point to deal with the implications for forestry plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, forestry is an issue that is being impacted upon mightily by the actions of the federal government and the state government of New South Wales. It is particularly interesting that there are provisions in chapter 7 of this bill for tax justice for forestry plantations. The purpose of these particular amendments is to remove an anomaly in the income tax law that may operate to disadvantage taxpayers who purchase an established but immature plantation or immature forest and subsequently sell it with the timber still standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, these taxpayers may be taxed on the gross profits of the sale of the standing timber. This matter is very relevant because this year the New South Wales state government, led by Mr Bob Carr, has completely halted any logging of the forests, which have been the traditional source of timber for the northern New South Wales timber industry. The New South Wales government has limited plantations and regrowth areas. From the end of September, all logging activity had to go into regrowth or plantations in north-east New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sounds fine but you have to realise that the loggers are being forcibly put into plantations and regrowth areas 10 to 20 years before they should be there. As well as that, the quotas will be reduced by 30 per cent on 1 July next year and that reduction will go to 50 per cent in 1998. The result is that the plantations now being logged are far too small. Loggers are being forced into taking timber 10 to 20 years too early. That is absolutely crazy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, while it is good to see that the taxation anomaly is being removed, I wonder if there will be enough timber logging operations going on in the next 15 or 20 years to make that removal valid. The timber industry will be killed, not only by the activity of the New South Wales government but by the federal government's 15 per cent reserve. In addition to national parks, state forests and vacant crown land, the government will have to take 88,800 hectares of freehold land to make up that 15 per cent reserve. The taxation arrangements will be relevant only if people are making money and having to pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to enlarge on the meaning of establishment expenditure. In respect of horticultural plants, establishment expenditure is capital expenditure incurred by a person after 9 May 1995 on the establishment of horticultural plants for use in the business of primary production. There is no definition of what constitutes the cost of establishing a horticultural plantation; however, costs may include the cost of acquiring the plants or their seeds and the cost of planting the plants or seeds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Costs may also include any costs incurred in preparing to plant&mdash;although that does not include the costs of the initial clearing of the land&mdash;and, in some cases, part of the costs of ploughing, contouring, top dressing, fertilising, stain removal, top soil enhancement, and so on, which are attributable to the establishment of the plants. They may also include: the cost of pots and potting mixtures for potted plants; the costs incurred in grafting trees; and the cost of replacing existing plants and trees because of the loss of fair economic return due to declining popularity of a particular existing variety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned trellising and the variation in treatment between kiwi fruit and grape trellises. Netting should also be mentioned. Very often these plants have to be netted. There is capital expenditure in putting up the wiring. I have been involved in putting up netting over blueberries to protect them from birds. It would be fairer for blueberry growers if they could write off that expenditure over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I repeat that the coalition certainly supports this bill. But, while it is a step in the right direction, it does not go far enough. I fully expect that after the next election we will be on the treasury bench and I look forward then to being able to do the right thing by the horticultural producers of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), particularly after the remarks made by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) because they provide an appropriate backdrop to the comments that I would like to make on this bill. As the member for Cowper has said, the particular interest that he and I have, and I am bold to suggest that the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has, in this bill focuses on its implications for horticultural plantings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has long been proud of its reputation as a non-interventionist government. It has endeavoured, I believe with good intent, to let market forces find their own course. It has endeavoured to stay out of and not interfere in the marketplace. There have been times when it would have been much easier for the opposition to have criticised the government for that, particularly in such areas as world trade reform, but instead the opposition has chosen, because it believes the government is on the right track, to support the government in its largely non-interventionist role in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we have before us tonight, as elucidated by the member for Cowper, illustrates an area where the government has somewhat unwittingly intervened in and interfered with the marketplace. Following the 1993 Dawkins budget proposal for a wine tax&mdash;a tax that was opposed by the opposition and the wine industry&mdash;part of the compromise offered to the wine industry, as a package of reforms to get it to accept a review of the tax, was the opportunity for the cost of planting vineyards to be written off over a five-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that, in that instance, the government interfered with, intervened in, the arrangements that were in place for the establishment of vineyards. It intervened, deliberately skewing the tax act in order to encourage the planting of vineyards. In that role, the government was supported by the opposition. As a result, wherever you go in vineyard areas in Australia in 1995 you can see quite an unprecedented growth in vineyard development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly marked in my electorate, in the Riverland and the Barossa, and in the Clare Valley of the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). Those from electorates in New South Wales would be familiar with the dramatic expansion that is occurring in the Hunter, and the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) can vouch for the dramatic expansion that is occurring in the Coonawarra region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expansion in grape plantings is unprecedented, and it may be well founded. There is no reason why the House should be nervous about the expansions occurring in the grape industry. In fact, judging by an inquiry last week into the future of the wine-grape industry in Australia, there is every reason to be optimistic. Only last night, along with a number of coalition members, I dined in the House with a winemaker who indicated that he was anticipating a further expansion in his vineyard that would cost about $3.5 million. The only reason he had not proceeded with that expansion was that he was waiting for the outcome of the government's deliberation on the report into the wine industry and the decision as to how the sales tax and the sales tax structure for the wine industry ought to be set up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point remains that the government chose to intervene in order to favour the planting of wine grapes. As a result of that, horticulturalists around Australia said, `Why can't we have some of this action as well?' After all, a tree in the ground has much the same life expectancy as a vine in the ground, and a tree in the ground has much the same, although in some cases a somewhat extended, lead time&mdash;that is, the time between planting and harvesting. It takes trees about five or six years and vines three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was, after the decision of the government to intervene in the wine industry, that the citrus industry found itself in crisis. There was a call for a review of horticultural plantings across Australia. The government set up a task force under Senator Sherry, and one of the things that that task force offered to the citrus industry principally, but to horticultural industries generally, was a review of the tax write-off on horticultural plantings. The task force suggested that that review should parallel what had happened in the wine industry and what had been done for vineyard plantings across Australia. Horticulturalists were left with a general air of anticipation. They anticipated that the government would legislate so as to allow them the same write-off as existed for viticulturists. What they got was the bill currently before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this bill is that the government has intervened, with opposition support, and as a consequence it has unwisely prejudiced investment in favour of viticulture. It has run counter to the market forces. It is true to say that, in the present optimistic outlook for wine grapes, we can expect the plantings that are occurring in vineyards, but those who have money to invest, particularly in the irrigation areas&mdash;represented here by the member for Mallee and me&mdash;are currently encouraged to invest by reason of the tax structure in a vineyard planting rather than a horticultural planting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has to come to terms with the fact that the bill before the House suggests, unwisely, that people should favour vineyards over horticultural plantings not because of the market outlook but because of the opportunity to write off their investments over a much smaller time. The reality is that not the same plants but comparable plants in terms of their life expectancy&mdash;not plants with a comparable lead time but plants with a dramatically different tax write-off schedule&mdash;are going to the ground as a result of the bill currently being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware better than most, if I may immodestly suggest, of the optimistic outlook that the wine industry currently has. But what we should not overlook are the opportunities for export enhancement that also apply to horticultural industries. You have only to look at the quantity of walnuts, for example, currently being imported into Australia or the quantity of olives coming into Australia to know that here are two crops where Australian producers can match the rest of the world&mdash;if only we could encourage Australian producers to invest in these crops, both of which have an extensive lead time and a long life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that a similar analogy could be used for the almond industry and even the citrus industry, the crisis in which prompted this legislation. Even the citrus industry currently has export potential that was not appreciated 18 months ago. I am aware of a packing house in my region which in a 12-month period has taken its fruit packing line from an average export performance of 15 per cent to 45 per cent. So opportunities are there. What the government should be wary of is deliberately structuring the tax base so that it favours vineyards unfairly over horticultural plantings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would encourage the government&mdash;and it is the intention of the opposition to deliberately change this legislation when it has the numbers to do so&mdash;to ensure that those who choose to plant either vineyards or horticultural crops do so knowing that it is the market that dictates that decision and not a decision of the government to offer a short-term tax write-off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House includes a schedule of the manner in which horticultural crops, horticultural plants, may be written off. That schedule in itself is a reason for us to be apprehensive about the legislation, because it complicates the way in which growers can go about writing off a crop. The reality, as I hope the House is aware, is that under the vineyard legislation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Racism is the theory that human characteristics and intellectual abilities are determined by race and that these are hereditary. This belief is one of the lowest and most primitive forms of collectivism. It is the idea that people are judged by the character and actions of their ancestors rather than as individuals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 20th century the development of more efficient killing mechanisms, mass media and the unprecedented mobility of the world's population have made possible the worst excesses of racism in human history&mdash;the holocaust, apartheid and now the Balkan tragedy. Multiculturalism was created as a solution to the problems of racism. But as the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported about race relations in the USA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a growing chorus of influential voices which argues that multiculturalism, far from being the harbinger of a fairer, more tolerant and more peaceful America, is in fact a turncoat which threatens the very future it was designed to protect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These voices are not confined, as could be expected, to the reactionary right wing, eager to maintain a dominant white Anglo status quo, but from moderate and even left-of-centre thinkers, many of whom have done an unprecedented about-face.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is that to the extent that multiculturalism promotes tolerance it is a good thing but to the extent that it promotes separatism and hostility it leads back to the gas chambers. Cultural pride is a two-sided coin. To draw comfort from one's ancestors, traditions and group can be good but it also can be the beginning of insanity, as Hitler's promotion of national pride and Aryan culture in the 1930s demonstrated.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all part of the human race and there are common and universal individual human rights which take precedence over nationalism or cultural sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal policy in Australia over the last 20 years has sometimes veered close to apartheid and separatism. Reinforcement of cultural pride and self-determination taken to extremes contain the seeds of their own failure. It has become commonplace for some Aboriginal leaders to be reported making racist statements about `whitey' and advocating racial separation. They give the impression they would like to press the rewind button and have everyone who has arrived in Australia since 1788 run backwards to Circular Quay and take a ship back to where they came from in a reverse family reunion, boat people program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such attitudes can only erode the overwhelming desire of the majority of people to remove the many disadvantages suffered by people of Aboriginal descent. A relatively minor example of such separatism is the closure of some through roads in Australia and the requirement to obtain passes to access others, South African style, based on one's racial origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the enormous growth of tourism in outback Australia this is promoting unnecessary hostile attitudes to Aboriginal people and exacerbating racial tension. No-one disputes the requirement to obtain the landowner's permission to access private roads but the closure of through roads, or the requirement to obtain passes for main connecting roads, weeks ahead, is another thing. Public roads run through private property all over Australia and access is open provided the motorist does not leave the road. Aboriginal lands should be no different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Present rules closing, or requiring passes for, the only connecting roads to Western Australia such as the world-famous Gunbarrel Highway through Central Australia from the eastern states are creating a bureaucratic nightmare as well as inconveniencing and often humiliating tourists. It is not as if the issuing of passes is a means of income. They are issued free but both the volume and need to consult with various communities can mean weeks of delay and many frustrating telephone calls. The net result is that tourists are prevented from making spontaneous decisions while travelling and are sometimes ordered off roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is unnecessary and does not benefit Aboriginal communities. It may satisfy those who hanker for retribution for past injustice but it is destructive and should not be defended by legal sophistry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to pass on my sincere commendation and congratulations to the Queensland Minister for Health, Mr Peter Beattie. In the last few days, Peter Beattie has announced two major hospital renovation and rebuilding programs, both of which will serve the needs of my constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the state Minister for Health announced a major upgrading of the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, which will lead to significantly improved services to Brisbane's southside residents. Mr Beattie has announced that the hospital will be expanded to provide more surgical, medical, emergency and rehabilitation services. For the first time in this hospital's 15-year history, all six theatres will be used to provide an estimated 3,000 extra operations a year to the residents of the southern suburbs of Brisbane. This will virtually double the number of patients undergoing surgery at the hospital and will also have a substantial impact on waiting lists in the Brisbane south region in specialties such as orthopaedics, urology and gynaecology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, an emergency department will be reopened as part of a regional network of emergency services. It will have a full-time director and will be able to admit or transfer patients according to clinical protocols. There will be a fully staffed, 30-bed medical unit established with up to 3,000 admissions anticipated each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queen Elizabeth II, or QEII, as we call it in my electorate, is a very important hospital. This is a major improvement in the range of services that will be provided to the residents of the southern suburbs and I am delighted that the minister has seen fit to commit such additional funding to this hospital to enable this upgrading to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second announcement he has recently made is with regard to a brand new hospital which will be built alongside the existing Princess Alexandra Hospital, which is also on the boundary of my electorate but which serves most of my constituents. There will be $225 million expended to provide a new hospital there. The building program will commence very shortly. The exact site has not yet been worked out because that has to be designed to fit in with the existing facilities, but this will make this complex the major tertiary teaching and research hospital in Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the minister has seen fit to allocate such significant amounts of money to health and hospital services in the southern suburbs. This is in sharp contrast, might I say, to the performance of most of the conservative state governments around this country, who have been cutting back on the amount of money they have been expending on the health and hospital services in their states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government has been working very closely with the Commonwealth government and is increasing the amount of money it is allocating to hospitals. These two announcements, serving the needs of my constituents in the southern suburbs of Brisbane, are a very clear indication of the very strong commitment the Labor Party has at both the state and federal levels to health and hospital services and to building up those services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You might be interested to know that in the 1995-96 financial year the Commonwealth government will be contributing some $862 million to the Queensland hospital sector. That is a significant increase on the previous year, when it was $776 million. Each year for the last five years the Commonwealth has significantly increased in real terms the amount of money it has provided to the Queensland hospital system. In 1992-93, the increase was 4.08 per cent. In 1993-94 we increased funding to the state hospital sector by 9.35 per cent in real terms and in 1994-95 we increased it by 2.33 per cent. In 1995-96, there will be a significant increase, of almost 10 per cent, in the funding to the Queensland hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth contributes over $2.8 billion a year to looking after the health needs of Queenslanders in the full range of health services that are required. This is a major contribution by the Commonwealth to the welfare of Queenslanders and builds upon the commitment the Queensland state government is making to the health and welfare of its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I congratulate again the new Minister for Health, Peter Beattie, and promise him that I will work very closely with him to ensure that continuing growth in federal funds occurs and that these new upgrading programs at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the PA hospital will proceed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remote outback New South Wales town of White Cliffs is famous for its opals, but tonight I pay tribute to the White Cliffs auxiliary of the Royal Flying Doctor Service for their fundraising efforts for the Royal Flying Doctor Service again this year. It culminated in the annual RFDS dinner dance on Saturday, 14 October. I was honoured to be present at that function along with about 150 other people from White Cliffs and district and the surrounding towns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major fundraising activity of the auxiliary this year was their sponsored horse ride which they have held each of the last eight years. They take a different route each year and this year the ride was from Wanaaring to Tibooburra over the week 24 September to 30 September. It is a distance of 230 kilometres. I drove it a month or so ago and it is quite a rough track in places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the honour at the dinner dance of presenting the sashes to the successful riders. I would like to read their names out. Claire McCallum of Coonabarabran raised $530. Kate Homfrey of Wilcannia, who also took part in the first ride, raised $1,100. From Wanaaring there was a good contingent&mdash;Debbie Eichner, Jo Lindsay, Robin Mann, Barbara Brown and David Threshing. Between them they raised $3,400. From the little town of Tilpa, Colin Middleton and Adelaide Middleton, along with the younger ones, Lisa and Kate Middleton, who travelled in a buggy, raised $3,000. A very fine effort was made by White Cliffs riders Benita Tatt, Kelly Mannion and Maureen Ker, who raised between them $8,593.16. With various sundries, that came to a grand total of $16,773. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that just in the last few days the White Cliffs contingent has had another $500 come in. So over $17,000 will have been raised from this event for the flying doctor service. I particularly pay tribute to Maureen Ker, who has been a tower of strength in recent years with her organisational skills for this ride. She comes from Tarella Station and she works as the sole remote area nurse at White Cliffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those riders incidentally were as young as 10 years of age. They had a fine backup team this year of Ben Homfrey, Jan Engis, Adelaide Middleton and Shirley Kot. I think I should also mention the support from Graham and Maxine Wellings at the White Cliffs hotel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the dinner dance that night there was a youngster there, only 3 1/2 years old, Shaun Kennewell, who amused the gathering with his guitar playing. He raised over $100 alone on the night. One who did not ride this year but has been in six previous rides was Carol Mengersen. Incidentally, her address is Dugout 3, White Cliffs, if you want to write to her. She has been a great supporter of the event over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money is put to good use. A few years ago, for example, it paid for the lights on the airstrip so that the King Airs can land at night-time. As well as the horse riding function and the dinner dance, White Cliffs had a family day back in August and also raised over $1,000. So you can see the people of White Cliffs district are very generous indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal flying doctor centre is based at Broken Hill. They conduct 35 clinics every year at White Cliffs. They turn up for two weeks out of every three. About 20 to 30 people turn up to each clinic. They have had up to 40 people turning up. In addition to that, they fly two or three people out of the district each month either down to Broken Hill for attention or, if more serious, down to Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">White Cliffs has a population of only about 80 officially, although there are 200 or 300 there, particularly through the winter months. They live mainly in dugouts. There are only 17 or 18 houses there. From Broken Hill, the flying doctor flies out to Tibooburra, Moomba, Hungerford, Wanaaring, White Cliffs, Louth, Tilpa, Wilcannia, Menindee and Ivanhoe. Most of those towns are in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just over 50 per cent of the income of the flying doctor service comes from donations. The rest comes from the state and Commonwealth government, although I was disappointed the Commonwealth government reduced its contribution by 20 per cent this year. The flying doctor service cannot run without these donations such as are provided by the White Cliffs auxiliary. I think it is appropriate their efforts should be recognised in the Australian parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Western Australia, my home state, is of course the home of the Liberal Party's industrial relations policies.

But we should not forget that Western Australia is also the home of Liberal Party disunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reminded of this recently by the brochure of the Independent member for Moore (Mr Filing), which came across my desk. He is coincidentally in the chamber this evening. His brochure contains some very fine endorsements, which I think are worthy of reading to the House. The brochure states:</PARA>

<PARA>It is a pity Mr Howard did not do anything to keep him there so far as Liberal Party endorsement was concerned. He has the support of the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Western Australia, Colin Barnett. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh, I think the preselection (for Filing) has to be looked at. I've had numerous calls from Liberal supporters and business people over the weekend, all of them regard what has happened to Paul Filing as an absolute disgrace.</PARA>

<PARA>He got knocked off and it was the best example of Liberal Party disunity in Western Australia. Another example is the Independent member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I am awaiting a copy of his brochure. I will be happy to give it a run when I see it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not going to be a pretty few months in the West.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the state of the Liberal Party in Western Australia? For example, if the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) is not fending off the Australian Federal Police officers from his door, then he is no doubt assiduously reading the appeal book by Senator Crichton-Browne.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) With the June release some software problems were identified late in the process. They were not considered critical at the time but in combination with hardware problems did cause serious operational problems which impacted on staff and customers. Because the system changes are usually interdependent it is often simply not possible to change specific elements. These are dealt with by work arounds introduced at the time of the change or shortly afterwards. Although almost unavoidable this is not a satisfactory situation and every sensible effort is made to avoid problems arising. In the light of recent experience the Department is trialling new ways to avoid the incidence of such problems. However in the final result the changes must proceed to comply with the law and to ensure customers receive their entitlements.</PARA>
